<a name="intro"><h3>Introduction</h3></a>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Department develops and builds space instruments to study the atmospheres of the Earth and the planets of the Solar System. Data analysis for experiments already in space involves sophisticated radiative transfer and information retrieval theory, and applications aimed at an improved understanding of global dynamics, composition and energy balance and their evolution. Theoretical and modelling groups in the areas of atmospheric dynamics, physical oceanography, nonlinear processes and geophysical and planetary fluid dynamics study fundamental atmospheric processes, and carry out laboratory experiments on rotating fluids. The overall goals are to understand how atmospheres function, as physical systems; to understand their origin and evolution; and to seek physics-based solutions to problems of the global environment such as ozone depletion, greenhouse warming, and climate change. </P>



<a name="earth"><h3>Earth Observation</h3></a>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Our involvement in the data analysis side of the Michelson Interferometer for Passive Atmospheric Sounding (MIPAS) project has become greater during this year. The MIPAS reference forward model which we provided last year has become the model of choice for line-by-line spectral calculations both here and elsewhere. We have also provided efficient transmittance models to be used in the operational retrieval system, and started work on the selection of microwindows, i.e. the spectral regions in which the information about the atmosphere is cleanest, for use in the operational data analysis. This is based on the method developed by a student, Victoria Jay, who is now using her approach to analyse data from a balloon version of MIPAS.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Upper Atmosphere Research Satellite (UARS) constituent reference atmosphere, which John Remedios has been leading for the UARS Science Team project is now available to the public on the UARS web site. John Remedios' EC Framework 4 study (`POSTCODE') of Polar Stratospheric Clouds and Ozone Depletion is continuing successfully. The work includes the use of in-situ and satellite data, laboratory measurements and chemical and microphysical modelling. Associated with this project is a student, Steve Bass, who is making laboratory spectral measurements of simulated PSC particles.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Also continuing is our assessment of the capabilities of mid-IR sounding methods for the ESA study on the proposed Atmospheric Chemistry Explorer satellite (ACE). We anticipate that this will lead to collaboration in a future mission.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Other research student projects include:</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Sarah Watts is using the ATSR data to study the microphysics of tropical cirrus.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Pauline Sinclair has been preparing to measure urban pollution using a Fourier transform infrared spectrometer at a congested traffic site in the centre of Oxford.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Paul Palmer has completed his work on the use of optimal estimation methods for the retrieval of temperature and water from Global Positioning System (GPS) data.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Kate Paulin is analysing measurements of tropospheric CO made from an aircraft version of the MOPITT instrument, which is due to be launched on the Terra satellite in December 1999. She has been assisting our colleagues in Boulder, Colorado in this work.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Department's largest project continues to be the HIRDLS remote sounding satellite instrument to fly on the Chem-1 satellite in 2002. Chem-1 is part of NASA's Earth Observing System suite of satellites, and HIRDLS will measure the concentration of trace species, temperature and pressure variations in the Earth's atmosphere between about 8 and 100 km altitude. The primary aim of HIRDLS is to measure at a much finer spatial scale than previous instruments, to about 1 km vertical resolution and 500 km horizontally. Oxford is taking the scientific and technical lead in the UK, with the Rutherford Appleton Laboratory, Reading University, Matra Marconi Space and GEC-Marconi playing major roles. The University of Colorado at Boulder is taking the lead in the USA, with the National Center for Atmospheric Research, the University of Washington and lead by Lockheed-Martin companies undertaking major activities. Part of the hardware, namely the in-flight radiometric calibration target and electronics, the instrument gyroscope electronics, and the electrical and thermal ground support equipment, is being built at Oxford. The instrument will be calibrated at Oxford before launch, and to this end we are currently building a calibration laboratory plus test equipment, and undertaking a number of software tasks concerned with flight operations and data processing. The design is now final in most areas, the calibration facility has been nearly completed, the 5 m long 2.3 m diameter aluminium vacuum chamber, mounted on pneumatic mounts to isolate the instrument and test equipment from vibrational disturbances, has been installed, and clean room installation and the design of the calibration equipment to be mounted in the chamber is underway.</P>



<a name="ad"><h3>Atmosphere Dynamics</h3></a>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We continue to use a variety of numerical atmospheric models to investigate and interpret observations.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Estimates of the mass flux through the high-latitude tropopause are being made from observations, and a theoretical framework for interpreting the results is being developed. Aspects of stratospheric and upper tropospheric transport are under investigation, including the variability in lower stratospheric transport - particularly that of water vapour in low latitudes - and the "age" of stratospheric air.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Tidal simulations with a general circulation model are continuing, and are being compared with radar data and ISAMS data. The seasonal variability of the tides has been investigated and the two-day wave seems to be responsible for diurnal tidal variability. Preliminary results show that non-migrating tides can be caused by interactions of the tides with each other or with other atmospheric components.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A three year integration of a general circulation model has been analyzed for the wave spectra present. The model produces a number of planetary travelling waves (e.g. the 2-day wave) in the upper stratosphere and mesosphere whose characteristics agree well with observations. Analyses suggest that the summer mesopause is unstable to small perturbations and that a wave analogous to the 2-day wave can grow there.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The observed apparent downward propagation of Arctic Oscillation anomalies is being sought in model data, to assess the influence of the stratosphere on surface fields. The implications of changes in the Arctic Oscillation for the detection of climate change are also being investigated. The atmospheric response over the northern midlatitudes to El Ni&ntilde;o - Southern Oscillation (ENSO) is being analysed using a state-of-the-art atmospheric general circulation model.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Other studies include the interannual variation of quasi-stationary waves in the Southern Hemisphere in connection with ozone distribution, and the influence of ozone holes on the general circulation of the atmosphere.</P>



<a name="gpfd"><h3>Geophysical and Planetary Fluid Dynamics</h3></a>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Studies of fundamental dynamical processes in rotating fluids have continued on several fronts, including laboratory studies of interactions between baroclinic waves and factors such as bottom topography and ageostrophic inertia-gravity wave modes. Further analysis of some of our earlier experiments on the generation of small-scale waves within a baroclinic life-cycle in a two-layer stratified flow have confirmed that the small-scale structures are fast inertia-gravity waves, generated as a result of spontaneous adjustment radiation when the local gravitational Froude number (= flow speed/gravity wave speed) approaches unity. This discovery may have an important bearing on various issues in dynamical meteorology and weather prediction. Laboratory studies on interactions of baroclinic waves with topography have revealed some new time-dependent flow regimes, in which slow, erratic oscillations take place between the zonal mean flow, topographically forced waves and travelling baroclinic waves. In one of the regimes, the oscillations show a strong qualitative resemblance to the behaviour of Sudden Stratospheric Warmings (SSWs) in the atmosphere, with recurrence timescales which scale to those comparable with the seasonal cycle on Earth. These results lend support to the interpretation of SSWs as a phenomenon intrinsic to the stratosphere, whose behaviour is then modulated by the seasonal changes in the stratospheric circulation.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Models for use in planetary atmosphere studies also continue to be a major activity with the GPFD group. Development of the Mars general circulation model has continued in collaboration with the Laboratoire de Meteorologie Dynamique du CNRS in Paris, focusing on refining and extending the physical parameterisation schemes (e.g. for radiative transfer, dust and topographic effects), and on data assimilation of atmospheric sounding measurements from the Thermal Emission Spectrometer (TES) on board the Mars Global Surveyor (MGS) spacecraft. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In the latter, observations acquired during the aerobraking hiatus of the MGS mission just prior to the Noachis dust storm event in 1998 have been successfully assimilated into our Mars GCM. Although the data sampling available at this time is much inferior to that available from the current mapping orbit of MGS, the results are sufficient to indicate the thermal effects of reduced dust loading over the South pole of Mars at this time, and the presence of substantial stationary planetary and travelling baroclinic transient waves in the atmosphere. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Mars GCM is now running with a fully interactive dust transport cycle, and some experiments have been run over seasonal timescales during the dust storm season in the Southern hemisphere of Mars. A new parametrization of the effects of 'dust devils' - small-scale convective atmospheric vortices near the surface which draw dust into columnar structures in the atmospheric boundary layer, and which have been observed in images and surface observations by the Mars Pathfinder and MGS missions - has been developed and incorporated into the Mars GCM. Results indicate that dust devils may play an important role in sustaining the dust loading of the Martian atmosphere throughout the year. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Good progress has also been made on the development of a simple general circulation model (SGCM) of Jupiter's troposphere and stratosphere, based on a version of the UK Meteorological Office Unified Model. A number of simulations have been carried out using simplified parameterisations of radiative transfer and dissipation, demonstrating the formation of a westerly equatorial jet in the presence of a low-latitude Hadley circulation and the excitation of equatorial planetary waves, the latter of which may have observable signatures which current and future missions may be able to detect. It is hoped to develop this model further in the future with more sophisticated and comprehensive physical parameterisations, for use in the interpretation of observations from the Galileo and Cassini missions to Jupiter and Saturn.</P>



<a name="data"><h3>Planetary Data Analysis</h3></a>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Galileo spacecraft continues to function after over 4 years in orbit about Jupiter and the analysis of the data remains the core activity of the group with funding available for at least the next three years. Galileo was launched in 1989 and went into a series of highly elliptical orbits about Jupiter in December, 1995, following the successful deployment of its atmospheric entry probe. Oxford is part of the international team which provided the Near Infrared Mapping Spectrometer (NIMS) on board the orbiter which measures of the infrared spectrum from 0.7 - 5.2 mm. Oxford has played a key role in the analysis of the NIMS data, which began to arrive in June 1996, using advanced radiative transfer code which is able to simulate the complex, scattering processes in that cloudy atmosphere. These models, combined with optimal estimation retrieval code also developed in Oxford, continue to provide new estimates of cloud heights and properties together with the abundances of gases such as water vapour and ammonia. To assist in this analysis, Oxford has conducted a program for many years to measure the spectral characteristics of Jovian gases in the laboratory. A new study has just begun to investigate the low temperature transmission spectrum of methane at wavelengths less than 1 micron, together with that of ammonia from 0.7 to 5 microns. A new spectroscopic facility is currently being built in Oxford to conduct not only these experiments, but also those planned to support a number of future missions outlined below.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In addition to the analysis of Galileo NIMS data, we continue to be involved with the Composite Infra-Red Spectrometer (CIRS) for which it provided the cooler and the cold focal plane. CIRS was launched to Saturn on the Cassini spacecraft in 1997 and Cassini will make a flyby of Jupiter in December 2000. Oxford will be closely involved in the analysis of these data.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Oxford is also part of the proposed VESAT mission to Venus and to that end has just recruited a new D.Phil. to reanalyse the Pioneer Venus OIR (Orbiter Infrared Radiometer) data from 1979. Radiative transfer models and spectral data bases have advanced greatly since the early 80s and in addition, a new data set has become available from the Russian Venera 15 spacecraft which is highly complementary to the OIR data since it has high spectral resolution, but poor spatial resolution while the OIR data has poor spectral resolution but good spatial coverage. A combined analysis of these data should yield greatly improved estimates for the abundance and distribution of water vapour in the Venus mesosphere.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The group was planning to play a major part in the analysis of Martian atmospheric data from the Pressure Modulator Infrared Radiometer, re-launched in Mars Climate Orbiter in 1998 following the loss of the Mars Observer spacecraft in 1993. Tragically, Mars Climate Orbiter was also lost owing to an error in the navigation and the prospects of a PMIRR-3 now look remote. Fortunately there are a number of other missions in their design stage with which the group is now becoming involved. These include a surface science package for the Mars Netlander and optical delay lines for future missions to detect extra-solar planets using very large base-line optical interferometry. The current ESA version of this experiment is called Darwin and the NASA version is TPF (Terrestrial Planet Finder). Planets around other stars have already been detected by other means, but these new missions plan to use free-flying mirrors and interferometry to cancel out the light from the central star allowing the analysis of the planet's thermal emission spectrum. These spectra will then be analysed to detect possibly biogenic indicators such as ozone. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Finally, Oxford continues to be a part of an international team (with other members at QMW, Canada) analysing the infrared spectra of Saturn and Titan measured by the Infrared Space Observatory (ISO). Simulations of the infrared spectrum of Titan, the largest of Saturn's moons and a key target of the Cassini mission, launched in October 1997, have been conducted to assist in the mission planning of that project.</P>



<a name="oceancc"><h3>Oceanography and Climate Change</h3></a>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Methods of detecting the "fingerprint" of anthropogenic climate change are being developed by Nathan Gillett in collaboration with the Rutherford Appleton Laboratory. Using a combination of statistical analysis and inverse modelling techniques climate model simulations are compared with recent decadal-timescale changes in variables such as surface and atmospheric temperatures.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Work has continued on understanding the physical processes that maintain global ocean circulation and the ocean's role in climate. Tom Haine and Sue Gray have been analysing hydrographic and CFC observations from the North Atlantic and Southern Oceans to measure rates of water mass formation and hence the ocean's part in the global heat balance. Simulating man-made CFC tracers is a demanding test for numerical models of the ocean circulation. Our careful comparisons show that models can simulate the CFC distribution in the upper layers of the North Atlantic ocean, but the deep and bottom waters, are poorly represented. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Our new programme of research focused on the role of ocean-atmosphere interactions in the climate of the North Atlantic region continues. Martina Junge, Daniel Lea and collaborators from the University of Reading have completed the technical development of three adjoint general circulation models to investigate the ocean processes that drive decadal variability in sea surface temperature. We are now starting to isolate the predictable oceanic mechanisms that take part in low-frequency, coupled climate oscillations. A key aspect is to understand how remotely-sensing the sea surface from space informs us about the ocean interior. </P>
