This group photograph is from the 'Second Ozone Conference' which was held in
Oxford in September 1936 (the first was in Paris in 1929). The meeting
attracted scientists from all over the world (16 different countries) who were
working on or interested in atmospheric ozone.
<A HREF="dobson.htm">Dr Dobson</A>,
who was Reader in Meteorology in the Oxford University Physics Department, had
done much of the pioneering work, and was the main organiser of the conference.
<p>
29 of the papers presented were published in a supplement to the November 1936
issue the Quarterly Journal of the Royal Meteorological Society, which even by
today's standards represents very rapid action by the organisers and editor.
(The University Library copy is date stamped 5 December showing that the issue
was genuinely produced before then.)
<p>
A report of the meeting by Dr A. R. Meetham was printed in the Meteorological
Magazine for October 1936 (volume 71, pages 202-205). 
<p>
The next Ozone Conference was held in Brussels in 1951, under the auspices of
the newly formed International Ozone Commission. Subsequent meetings were held
in Oxford (1952), Rome (1954), Ravensburg (1956), Arosa (1961), Albuquerque
(1964), Boulder? (1980),
Thessaloniki (1984), L'Aquila (1996), Sapporo (2000). (See also Dobson, Applied Optics, 387-405, vol. 7 no 3, 1968.)

The framed original of the signed group photograph hangs in the Dobson Room,
Atmospheric, Oceanic and Planetary Physics, Department of Physics, Clarendon
Laboratory, Oxford University.
