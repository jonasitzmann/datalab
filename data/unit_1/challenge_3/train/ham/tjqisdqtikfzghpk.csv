<A NAME="proj"></A><H2>Projects for 2007</H2>

<P>The following provides information on some of the projects that may
be offered for students starting in October 2007.  Candidates should
note that this is not necessarily a comprehensive list and we
encourage applications in any of the research areas indicated in our
<A HREF="researchbooklet07.html"> Research Booklet</A>.

<H4>Spectral measurements of the Earth's surface</H4>

<P CLASS="Small">Motivation for this project comes from the necessity
to accurately represent spectral surface reflectance in the retrieval
of aerosol from space.  Over land, up to 70% of the measured signal
can come from reflection from the surface. Poor knowledge of surface
reflection is one of the largest contributions to the uncertainty in
aerosol loading and particle size with commensurate uncertainty in
estimates of local air quality.  The studentship involves the
construction of a four channel radiometer with channels located at
0.555 &mu;m, 0.659 &mu;m, 0.865 &mu;m and 1.6 &mu;m (i.e. similar to
those on AATSR).  The instrument will scan in both zenith and azimuth
to characterize the scene BRDF.  The major technical goal of the
project will be to demonstrate that a miniature instrument based upon
recently developed filters and detectors can achieve performance
comparable to that of current space based instrumentation with the
long term aim of performing these measurements from small satellites.

<H4> Volcano monitoring from space </H4>

<P CLASS="Small"> Recent work has shown that frequent small volcanic
eruptions that just manage to inject SO2 into the stratosphere have a
relatively large influence on climate. The primary objective of this
project is to develop robust means of identifying SO2 in infrared
spectral measurements (MIPAS, TES, IASI). A secondary objective is to
explore other potential volcanic signatures from space e.g. volcanic
hot spots, non-SO2 trace gases, ash identification and monitoring.

<H4> Non-spherical particle scattering 
<FONT COLOR=RED>NO LONGER AVAILABLE</FONT></H4>

<P CLASS="Small"> The scattering of light by non-spherical particles
produces a complicated function of scattered light intensity that is a
function of angle, particle size and shape and refractive index.  The
purpose of the SPARCLE instrument (developed in AOPP) is to determine
the size and refractive index of aerosol particles from scattered
light measurements.  This instrument currently assumes that the
aerosol particle is spherical.  The initial part of this project is to
develop fast T-matrix code (with derivatives) to optimise the detector
positioning in SPARCLE to either minimize (or maximize) the influence
of non-spherical particle shape on the measurements.  The second part
of the project is to develop scattering code for ensembles of
non-spherical particles following the work of Dubovik (2006). This
method reduces computation time in the calculation of light scattering
by a mixture of spheroids, by parameterizing the numerical integration
of spheroid optical properties over size and shape using look-up
tables of quadrature coefficients. The project will involve working
with other scientist who will use these coefficients (for sand, ash,
salt, ammonium sulphate and ammonium nitrate and black carbon aerosol)
in the retrieval of aerosol properties from space based
instrumentation.

<H4> Aerosol - cloud interactions using GRAPE data </H4>

<P CLASS="Small"> The GRAPE project has produced a global cloud
(optical depth, cloud phase, cloud height, effective radius) and
aerosol (optical depth, effective radius) dataset using a
state-of-the-art physical retrieval of the entire duration of the
ATSR-2 mission (aboard ERS-2).  Depending on the student's interest
this project could either focus on algorithm improvement in areas
which are problematic (thin cloud or aerosol retrieval over bright
surfaces) or address data reduction.  The later topic would involve
characterising the data set (averages, variability, trends) as well as
investigating possible links between retrieved aerosol and cloud
properties.

<H4> Measurement of halogen compounds in the stratosphere </H4>

<P CLASS="Small"> Over the past 50 years a number of man-made
halogenated (ie containing chlorine and fluorine) compounds have been
gradually released into the atmosphere.

<P CLASS="Small"> Chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) are known to decompose
stratosphere, producing the chlorine responsible for ozone
destruction. Under the Montreal protocol, production of these
compounds has ceased and stratospheric concentrations should have
peaked.

<P CLASS="Small"> Meanwhile, new halogenated compounds, HCFCs and
HFCs, have been developed to replace CFCs as refrigerants and
propellants. These are more chemically reactive than CFCs and are
expected to decompose in the upper troposphere, limiting the amount of
chlorine and fluorine that reaches the stratosphere.

<P CLASS="Small"> CF4 and SF6, two more artificial compounds released
as by-products of various industrial processes, have extremely long
lifetimes, even in the stratosphere. Since they also have significant
infrared absorption characteristics, their gradual accumulation has
consequences for global warming.  CF4 in particular is mentioned in
the Kyoto Protocol as a significant greenhouse gas.

<P CLASS="Small"> While there are a number of measurement programmes
monitoring the surface concentrations of these compounds at various
locations, there is no programme of global stratospheric measurements,
largely due to the lack of a suitable satellite instrument with a
sufficiently long measurement span.

<P CLASS="Small"> The Michelson Interferometer for Passive Atmospheric
Sounding (MIPAS) is part of the European Space Agency's ENVISAT
satellite launched in March 2002. MIPAS is a fourier-transform
spectrometer which measures the infrared emission spectra of the
earth's atmosphere from 4-15 microns.  The spectral signatures of
various halogenated compounds can be identified in these measurements
and therefore their concentrations retrieved. MIPAS has been producing
data for over 4 years now, which should also allow trends in
concentration to be deduced.

<P CLASS="Small"> The aim of this project is to create a global
dataset of halogen compounds in the stratosphere, and use this dataset
to answer some of the following scientific questions:

<OL>

<LI>Are the current stratospheric concentrations of CFCs decreasing as
predicted and in a globally uniform manner?

<LI>What fraction of the tropospheric HCFC concentration reaches the
stratosphere and how does it evolve once in the stratosphere?

<LI>Have HFCs reached a detectable level in the stratosphere and is it
possible to determine any trend?

<LI>What is the global distribution of long-lived species CF4 and SF6,
particularly at high altitude, and how is it evolving?

<P CLASS="Small">
The work will involve collaboration with ESA and other European groups working
on MIPAS data and chemical modelling.

</OL>

<H4> Atmospheric sounding using IASI </H4>

<P CLASS="Small"> The Infrared Atmospheric Sounding Interferometer
(IASI) is a nadir-viewing instrument launched on the MetOp satellite
in October 2006.  The instrument is primarily intended for use by
meteorological services, providing profiles of tropospheric
temperature and water vapour for weather forecasting. Such operational
products rely on fast, approximate methods of performing radiative
transfer calculations or statistical techniques such as neural
networks.

<P CLASS="Small"> Infrared limb-viewing instruments, on the other
hand, have generally been used for measuring stratospheric
concentrations of a variety of molecules, usually on a non-operational
basis, allowing more accurate (and therefore time-consuming) modelling
of the radiances.

<P CLASS="Small"> The main aim of this project is to apply techniques
developed for a limb-viewing interferometer (MIPAS) to the IASI
measurements, both to provide more accurate retrievals as validation
of the operational products and to investigate which other species can
be retrieved from the IASI spectra (e.g. CO2, CH4, and CO for the
atmospheric carbon budget).

<P CLASS="Small"> The work is expected to involve collaboration with
the UK Met Office, the EUMETSAT agency and other European groups
developing IASI retrieval schemes.

<H4> The climate on Venus compared to that of the Earth </H4>

<P CLASS="Small"> Data started arriving in 2006 from the first
European mission to Venus, with one of the main goals of the mission
being the elucidation of the processes responsible for the extreme
greenhouse effect on Venus, and its role in the stability of the
climate on the planet. These are thought to be fundamentally the same
as those that control the past and present climate on the Earth,
namely, a CO2-cloud-H2O greenhouse with important atmosphere-surface
interactions.  The project will use the new data from Venus to develop
this analogy and seek new insights into the evolution of the climate
on both planets.

<H4> Prospecting for ice at the poles of Mercury and the Moon
<FONT COLOR=RED>NO LONGER AVAILABLE</FONT></H4>
</H4>

<P CLASS="Small"> The Department has recently been selected to
participate in two new space experiments, to investigate suspected icy
deposits at the poles of the Moon (NASA Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter)
and at Mercury (ESA BepiColombo mission).  The nature and extent of
these has important implications for the history of water on all solar
system bodies, including of course the Earth.  A suitable DPhil
project for a student interested in space projects and planetary
geology would be to work on the development of these objectives, and
the design of the experiments, in collaboration with our partners in
the USA and Germany.

<H4> Venus atmospheric dynamics using Venus Express data </H4>

<P CLASS="Small"> Venus has a very dynamic atmosphere, with many
mysterious features.  Foremost among these is the atmospheric
super-rotation: the atmosphere rotates roughly fifty times faster than
does the planet underneath.  Another great mystery is the enormous
rotating dipolar structure seen at both the North and South poles.

<P CLASS="Small"> The project will examine these and other Venusian
meteorological phenomena using hyperspectral imaging data from the
VIRTIS imaging spectrometer on Europe's Venus Express satellite, which
is currently in orbit around Venus, combined with computer-based
radiative transfer analysis. Information on atmospheric dynamics is
obtained from 3-D mapping of temperature fields, 3-D mapping of
abundances of trace species, and tracking of cloud features in
repeated image sequences.

<H4> Dust and water cycles in the Martian atmosphere: GCM studies and
MRO data </H4>

<P CLASS="Small"> The transport and interaction of dust and water in
the Martian atmosphere and near-surface environment are the dominant
sources of climate variability on Mars. The Oxford Mars General
Circulation Model now has the capability of simulating the basic
features of both the dust and water cycles, but does not yet take into
account their mutual interaction or a range of other processes at the
martian surface. This project will extend and improve the model's
representation of dust and water processes, and make use of it in the
analysis and interpretation of new and detailed synoptic mapping
observations of dust and water in the Martian atmosphere from the Mars
Climate Sounder instrument on board the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter
(MRO). In particular, the possibility of extending the Oxford data
assimilation scheme to include water vapour transport will be
investigated.

<H4> Dynamics and circulation of Venus and Titan: GCM studies and data
from Cassini and Venus Express </H4>

<P CLASS="Small"> The circulation of the atmospheres of both Venus and
Titan are well known to exhibit very strong super-rotation and a
variety of similar enigmatic features, but both remain poorly
understood in detail.  Recent work in Oxford has resulted in the
development of a simplified general circulation model (GCM) of the
Venus atmosphere that is already capable of quantitatively reproducing
some aspects of its meteorology. In this project, this model will be
improved and extended to include more accurate representations of
radiative transfer, cloud physics and boundary layer processes adapted
to both Venus and Titan. The model will then be compared with new
observations (a) of the Venus atmosphere anticipated from ESA's Venus
Express mission, and (b) from the Cassini Orbiter, with a view to
elucidating phenomena such as Venus's polar dipole, the role of
various waves on both bodies and the organization of clouds and hazes.

<H4>Adaptive mesh modelling of rotating, stratified flows in the
laboratory <FONT COLOR=RED>NO LONGER AVAILABLE</FONT></H4>

<P CLASS="Small">Fluid flows driven either thermally or mechanically
in the laboratory, in containers placed on rotating platforms, have
long been studied as dynamical analogues of large-scale circulation
systems and processes in oceans and planetary atmospheres. The study
of such flows, produced in highly controlled experiments with
sophisticated measurement methods, can be a valuable source of insight
for understanding a broad range of problems and dynamical processes in
meteorology and climate science. Such flows may also provide a
substantial challenge to numerical modellers, and can be used as a
test-bed for evaluating novel modelling techniques, especially in
highly nonlinear dynamical regimes and in domains with complex
topography.

<P CLASS="Small">In the present project, it is proposed to apply a
new approach to numerical modelling, currently under development at
Imperial College, London, as part of a wider programme aimed at
designing a new generation of high performance models of ocean
circulation for use in climate and environmental research. This
approach entails the use of adaptive mesh finite elements, in which
the discretisation of a numerical model is conditioned both by the
topography of the domain AND the structure of the flow itself,
actually adjusting the mesh distribution dynamically as the flow
evolves. In this project, the student will adapt this code to simulate
a range of flows in rotating, cylindrical containers, driven either by
differential heating at the side boundaries or by differential
rotation of the horizontal boundaries. It is of particular interest to
introduce various forms of topography, either as axisymmetric bottom
slopes or azimuthally-periodic 'mountains', since these are analogous
to various idealisations of geophysical flow situations which have so
far been very difficult to simulate in more conventional numerical
models. The overall objectives of the project are (a) to investigate
the dynamics of rotating flow phenomena in complex topography, and (b)
to test and validate the numerical adaptive mesh techniques by
quantitative comparison with experimental measurements of comparable
flows, previously obtained in Prof. Read's laboratory in Oxford.

<P CLASS="Small">This project provides an opportunity for a student
with a strong background in mathematics, computation, engineering or
theoretical physics to gain experience with state-of-the-art numerical
CFD (computational fluid dynamics) techniques, in the context of a
rigorous training in various aspects of fundamental geophysical fluid
dynamics. There will also be opportunities to work with other members
of the adaptive mesh modelling team at Imperial College and elsewhere.

<H4>Analysing 21st century climate change in climateprediction.net
<FONT COLOR=RED>NO LONGER AVAILABLE</FONT></H4>

<P CLASS="Small">The student will make use of the 'grand-ensemble'
(many thousands of runs) of GCM simulations from climateprediction.net
(see www.climateprediction.net) to explore 20th and 21st century
climate under different combinations of initial conditions, climate
forcing and model parameterisations.  The student will be exploring
and, where possible, quantifying relationships between 20th century
climate observables, in both the real climate system and the many
thousands of modelled worlds, and the model simulations of 21st
century climate.  The research will involve analysis of CP.net data
and performing in-house GCM simulations to gain further insights into
specific climate processes and model characteristics.  The work will
build on and complement existing research in Atmospheric, Oceanic and
Planetary Physics (AOPP) and in the Climate Cluster in the Oxford
University Centre for the Environment (OUCE) . The successful
candidate would be expected to have a strong degree in physics, with
existing competency in climatology, statistics, physics and computer
programming.

<H4>
Improving the understanding of the aerosol microphysical state as a basis
for higher accuracy estimates of direct and indirect aerosol effects
</H4>

<P CLASS="Small">Atmospheric aerosols play a key role in the earth
system.  Aerosol particles influence the global radiation budget
directly, by scattering and absorption, as well as indirectly, by the
modification of cloud radiative and microphysical properties, with
effects on the hydrological cycle. Contrary to the well understood
radiative forcing of greenhouse gases, the aerosol radiative forcing
and thus the degree to which aerosol forcings mask the warming
greenhouse gas effect are not sufficiently understood, making aerosols
the single greatest source of uncertainty in the assessment of
anthropogenic climate change.

<P CLASS="Small">Key to the role of the aerosols in the
aerosol-climate interactions is the aerosol microphysical state,
i.e. the size-distribution, the composition, and mixing state of the
aerosol population, as it determines the aerosol lifetime, radiative
properties, and activation to cloud droplets, therefore the direct and
indirect aerosol effects.

<P CLASS="Small">The principal focus of this research project is to
improve the accuracy of assessments of both the direct and indirect
aerosol effects through increasing the understanding about the aerosol
microphysical state. The aim is to improve its representation in model
based estimates of the aerosol radiative effects, to quantify related
uncertainties, and to constrain the estimates with in-situ and remote
sensing measurements.

<P CLASS="Small">The project will be centred on modelling studies with
a state-of-the-art microphysical aerosol scheme embedded in a global
climate model. The quality of the simulated aerosol microphysical
state will be assessed with in-situ and remote-sensing measurement
products. A key objective is an improvement of the aerosol
microphysical processes in the model to reduce the remaining
deviations.  Further attention will be devoted to the aerosol sources
that significantly affect the aerosol microphysical state and
consequently the radiative effects.

<P CLASS="Small">Depending on the background and interests of the
candidate these global modelling studies can be supported by: a
multi-scale approach employing high resolution modelling studies with
a more explicit process representation; or by the analysis of remote
sensing and in-situ measurements of the aerosol microphysical
state. Both approaches facilitate the parameterization of sub-grid
scale processes from the local scale at the aerosol source to the
grid-box scale of global models as well as to quantify the related
uncertainties.

<P CLASS="Small">The work is expected to involve an active
co-operation with the UK Met Office and other European partners.

<H4>
Investigation of indirect aerosol effects by synergizing modelling and
satellite <BR>approaches
<FONT COLOR=RED>NO LONGER AVAILABLE</FONT></H4>

<P CLASS="Small">Atmospheric aerosols play a key role in the earth
system. Aerosol particles influence the global radiation budget
directly, by scattering and absorption, as well as indirectly, by the
modification of cloud radiative and microphysical properties, with
effects on the hydrological cycle. Contrary to the well understood
radiative forcing of greenhouse gases, the aerosol radiative forcing
and thus the degree to which aerosol forcings mask the warming
greenhouse gas effect are not sufficiently understood. In particular
the indirect aerosol effects are subject to great uncertainties.

<P CLASS="Small">State-of-the-art aerosol-cloud climate models allow
first quantitative estimates of the anthropogenic indirect aerosol
effects. However, owing to the complexity of the aerosol-cloud
interactions, with a significant sub-grid scale component, these
estimates remain highly uncertain. Satellite observations of aerosol
and clouds properties provide invaluable statistical constraints for
estimates of the aerosol indirect effects. However, issues such as
co-location of aerosol and cloud observations and in particular the
fact that anthropogenic aerosols are per-se not distinguishable from
fine natural aerosols complicate the quantification of the
anthropogenic indirect aerosol effects. The synergy of modelling
studies and satellite observations is the way forward to reduce the
remaining large uncertainties.

<P CLASS="Small">The key focus of this research project is to advance
the understanding about the indirect aerosol effects through modelling
studies with a state-of-the-art climate model with microphysical
representation of the aerosol cloud interactions in close synergy with
satellite observations of aerosol and cloud parameters. In particular
the upcoming data from the "A-Train", a constellation of six
co-located polar-orbiting satellites with multiple passive and active
sensors for the observation of aerosols and clouds, will provide
unmatched observational constraints on the global aerosol-cloud
interactions. These constraints will allow an improvement of the
process representation in global models and consequently allow
reducing and quantifying the uncertainties in estimates of the
indirect aerosol effects.

<P CLASS="Small">The work is expected to involve an active
co-operation with the UK Met Office and other European partners and a
strong interaction with the global A-Train community.

<H4>Sensitivity of the global ocean circulation to forcing anomalies
and model parameters </H4>

<P CLASS="Small"> The global ocean circulation plays a major role in
the the climate system, for example, in the Atlantic the meridional
overturning circulation transports roughly 1 petawatt of heat
northward which contributes to the relatively mild climatic conditions
currently found over northwestern Europe. The traditional approach to
determining the sensitivity of the ocean circulation to forcing
anomalies or model parameters is to run a large ensemble of numerical
experiments; for each model integration, we can determine the
sensitivity of all future model outputs to a single model input, i.e.,
a set of initial conditions.  Here, instead, we will use the "adjoint"
of an ocean model to determine the sensitivity of a model output to
the model inputs; an adjoint model is analogous to a model run
backwards in time, and therefore a single model integrations can
determine the sensitivity of a single model output (such as the
strength of the meridional overturning circulation at some latitude)
to all model inputs (such as forcing anomalies or model parameters).

<P CLASS="Small"> The student will use an adjoint ocean model to
determine the sensitivity of various elements of the global ocean
circulation to local and remote forcing anomalies and the uncertain
model parameters, focusing not just on sensitivities and
teleconnection patterns within the basins, but also on the role of the
Southern Ocean which connects the Atlantic, Pacific and Indian
basins. The numerical calculations will be supported by idealised
analytical and semi-analytical calculations in order to develop a deep
understanding of the underlying dynamics and physics.

<H4> Mars wind sensor development<BR><SMALL>
</SMALL></H4>

<P CLASS="Small"> Measuring wind on Mars is challenging, due to the
low density and dustiness of the Mars atmosphere, and due to the
stringent weight and power limits available on Mars landers. We built
a thermal wind sensor for the Beagle 2 Mars lander, and are due to
provide another for the upcoming European ExoMars mission.  Two wind
sensing techniques are being evaluated: a thermal wind sensor similar
to that we provided for Beagle 2, or an ultrasonic wind sensor. This
DPhil project will involve optimisation of the design as well as
performance evaluation in Oxford's Low Density Wind Tunnel, which
simulates Mars atmospheric conditions; the project may also involve
development of electronics needed to operate the sensor. Use of the
sensor in desert conditions on Earth is also possible.  This project
is a collaboration between the Department of Engineering Science and
Atmospheric, Oceanic and Planetary Physics.

<A name="dc"></A><H2>The D.Phil. degree</H2>

<P> The D.Phil. project period lasts nominally for three years.  There
is some <A
HREF="http://www.atm.ox.ac.uk/user/andrews/option.html">course
work</A> in the first year, leading to a written examination, but the
student should expect to start work on a research project in parallel
with course work. We do not expect course work to be completed before
a research project is begun. The student will produce a written report
at the end of each academic year, which will be reviewed internally in
the same manner as a thesis. The first year report and the written
examination will determine whether the student proceeds from
probationer to D.Phil. student status. A report at the end of the
second year will be examined in a similar way. The target is to
complete a D.Phil. thesis at the end of the third year,
which will be examined by two examiners, one internal and one
external.

<P> For further details on the D.Phil. degree, see the <A
HREF="http://www.admin.ox.ac.uk/gsp/courses/dphil.shtml"> Graduate
Studies Prospectus</a>.

<a name="qualifications"></a><H2>Qualifications</H2>

<P> A first or upper-second class degree (or equivalent) in Physics,
Chemistry, Mathematics or related subjects is required.  UK-based
Physics students should have taken/be taking the four-year Physics
course (M.Phys. or equivalent) rather than the three-year course
(B.Sc. or equivalent).

<P> Overseas applicants who are unsure how their degree compares with
the UK may find <A HREF="http://www.naric.org.uk/individuals.asp">

Physics and Astronomy Research Council (PPARC) allocate a number of
studentships to the Department each year in general areas of research
within their own disciplines.  NERC funds atmospheric and oceanic
topics for the Earth and PPARC funds projects for other planets.  The
detailed research topic is agreed between the supervisor and the
student.

<P>PPARC funding is limited to one studentship. We had four NERC
studentships to allocate in 2007 (These studentships have now all been
filled).

<A NAME="eligible"></A><P><B>Eligibility:</B> UK or EU nationals who have
been resident in the UK for at least the previous three years are
eligible for a studentship from NERC or PPARC to cover all fees and
living costs.  The current value of the maintenance award is
&pound;12,300 p.a.

<P>Other EU nationals who have not been resident in the UK qualify for
a 'fees-only' award, without any funding for living costs.  The
University recommends a minimum living allowance of &pound;9,750 p.a.

<P><B>Non-EU nationals who have been resident in the UK for at least
three years and have been granted indefinite leave to remain by the UK

GRADUATE ADMISSIONS CRITERIA
</B></FONT></CENTER>

<P><B>Programme of Study: D.Phil. in Atmospheric, Oceanic and Planetary
Physics</B>

<P>N.B. AOPP does not offer taught graduate courses

<P><B>1.  Introduction</B>

<P>In relation to the admission of students wishing to undertake a
graduate programme, and in the context of giving appropriate attention
to relevant equal opportunities principles and legislation, the
University regards as an overriding priority:

<OL TYPE="I">

<LI><I>For taught course degrees</I>, the admission of the most
suitably qualified candidates wellmatched to their chosen course;

<LI><I>For research degrees</I>, the admission of the most suitably qualified
candidates for whom the University can provide appropriate research
opportunities and supervision;

<LI>The selection of the most academically able set of candidates who
meet the admissions criteria for the available places.

</OL>

<P><B>2.  Criteria</B>

<P><I>Applications will normally be considered in the light of a
candidate's ability to meet the following criteria:</I>

<P><B>2.1  Academic ability</B>

<OL TYPE="a">
<LI>The applicant has provided appropriate indications of proven and
potential academic excellence.  Appropriate indicators may include two
or more references, academic transcripts or their equivalent, and
performance at interview(s).  If you have any written work that would
be helpful to us, for example published papers or an M.Sc. thesis, we
would like to be able to see it.
<LI>The applicant has provided sufficient evidence, in the view of the
assessors, to suggest that they have the academic ability and
commitment to pursue the chosen programme to a successful conclusion
within the required time limits.
<LI>Applicants are normally expected to have achieved an upper second
class or first class Honours Degree (or equivalent) in Physics,
Chemistry, Mathematics or related subjects. U.K. Physics students
should have taken the four year Physics course (M.Phys. or equivalent)
rather than the three year course (B.Sc. or equivalent).
</OL>

<P><B>2.2  English language requirement</B>

<P>Applicants whose first language is not English are required to
provide evidence of proficiency in English.  Candidates are normally
expected to meet the following criteria [this is the minimum language
requirement]:

<P>IELTS: an overall score of 7.0 with at least 6.5 in each component. 

<P>TOEFL: <I>paper-based test</I> - an overall score of 600 with a
Test of Written English (TWE) of 4.5; <I>computer-based test</I> - an
overall score of 250 with an Essay Writing score of 4.5;
<I>internet-based test</I> - an overall score of 100.

<P>Cambridge Certificate of Proficiency in English (CPE): Grade C

<P><B>2.3  Suitability</B>

<P>The programme of study that the applicant wishes to pursue is well
suited to the academic interests and abilities to which they have
drawn attention in their application and (where appropriate) the
applicant has undertaken any preliminary academic work or course which
is normally considered indispensable to acceptance on the proposed
programme of study.

<P>The relevant faculty/department is able to provide appropriate
supervision and facilities for the candidate's chosen programme of
work (the allocation of graduate supervision is the responsibility of
the department/faculty and it is not always possible to accommodate
the preferences of incoming graduate students to work with a
particular member of staff).

<P>Well qualified candidates may not be offered a place because:

<UL>
<LI>secure funding is not available (places offered on a conditional
basis will not be confirmed without a financial guarantee);
<LI>there are constraints on the availability of research facilities
(especially laboratory and library space) and on supervision;
<LI>there are limitations on the size of taught graduate courses;
<LI>there are limitations on the numbers of students which can be
admitted onto research programmes;
<LI>other candidates have been judged to match more closely the
admissions criteria.
</UL>

<P>It should also be noted that acceptance on a particular course
gives no guarantee of final success, and all courses require the
student to develop their learning and skills to new levels in order to
pass taught course examinations or successfully to undertake all the
assessment hurdles of a research programme.
