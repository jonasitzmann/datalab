</H4>

<p>
We present the results of an experimental investigation of a novel 
dynamical system in which one, two or three solid spheres are free to move
in a horizontal rotating cylinder filled with highly viscous fluid. At low
rotation rates steady motion is found where the balls adopt stable
equilibrium positions rotating adjacent to the rising wall at a speed which is
in surprisingly close agreement with available theory. At higher cylinder
speeds timeÂ­dependent motion sets in via Hopf bifurcations. When one
or two balls are present the motion is strictly periodic. However, low
dimensional chaos is found with three balls.
