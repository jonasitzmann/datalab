      <h2>Introduction<a id="introduction" name="introduction"></a></h2>
      <p><img src="images/monk.jpg" width="243" height="266" align="left" alt="Monk's Tale" hspace="3" />The 
        M.Phil. in Medieval and Renaissance literature is one of the most successful 
        courses of its kind. Each year it attracts a first-class intake of students 
        from the UK and abroad, and its graduates have an outstanding record in 
        gaining employment in the academic world and outside. Each student works 
        closely with a member of the Faculty on his or her chosen dissertation 
        topic, as well as participating in seminars and classes. Training in how 
        to read manuscript and early printed materials ensures that every student 
        on the course is able to make use of the extensive collections in the 
        University Library and in College libraries. Cambridge has a distinguished 
        international reputation in English and in many other fields in the humanities 
        (for example, Classics, Modern and Medieval Languages, History, Philosophy, 
        and History of Art), and students on this course can attend lectures offered 
        by any Faculty. This creates a learning environment which naturally enables 
        interdisciplinary work. The course lasts nine months, with the last 
        few months being devoted to intensive work on the dissertation. <img src="images/leviathan.jpg" width="234" height="175" align="right" alt="Leviathan" /></p>
      <p>Generally the course is taken in either Medieval literature or Renaissance 
        literature, but there is the option of combining work in both periods. 
        It is designed to be valuable both for students who wish to develop their 
        knowledge of the periods in a free-standing one year course, and as a 
        foundation year for those who wish to continue to work for the Ph.D. Students 
        can exercise a high degree of choice over the areas on which they concentrate 
        their energies, in order to suit their individual requirements.<br />
      </p>
      <p>Applications must be received by 15 January in the calendar year in which 
        the student wishes to be admitted. The course begins in the second week 
        of October. It is preceded by optional elementary Latin classes, for those 
        requiring them, during the last fortnight in September. Seminars and classes 
        run throughout the Michaelmas and Lent terms (that is the first and second 
        terms of the academic year), and the work done in relation to them is 
        assessed between December and March by two coursework essays, and by exercises 
        in textual and related studies. </p>
      <p>Individual research on topics chosen by students in consultation with 
        their supervisors is pursued throughout the year, and becomes the sole 
        focus of their work after the taught element of the course is completed 
        during the Lent (second) term. They are required to submit in mid-June the fruits of this research work in the form of either a 15,000-word dissertation 
        or three essays which together amount to 15,000 words. All candidates 
        for the Cambridge Ph.D. who intend to write doctoral dissertations concerning 
        the period from 1066 to 1700 will be required (unless they have already 
        had equivalent postgraduate training) to take the M.Phil. before being 
        permitted to register for the higher degree. </p>
      <hr />
      <h2>THE MEDIEVAL COURSE<a id="medieval" name="medieval"></a></h2>
      
    <p><img src="images/abc.jpg" width="185" height="376" align="left" alt="Chaucer's ABC" hspace="3" />Faculty 
      members in Medieval studies share an interest in combining historical and 
      critical approaches to medieval writing. Their particular concerns include 
      early Middle English, Chaucer, Langland, drama, romance, editing, manuscript 
      studies, the mystics, Malory, lyrics (including their musical aspect), beast 
      literature (and satire more generally). However, any proposal for a particular 
      project falling within the general field of Medieval English studies (very 
      broadly defined, from c. 1100-c. 1550) will be considered. From the outset, 
      graduate students will pursue individual research projects with the guidance 
      of a supervisor. They will attend classes on bibliography, manuscripts and 
      textual studies, as well as a participatory seminar on the interpretation 
      of literary texts. These elements continue through the Michaelmas and Lent 
      terms (first two terms of the year). Students interested in combining Medieval 
      with Renaissance work will be encouraged to attend classes and seminars 
      in the later period. </p>
      <p>There is provision for acquiring and developing language skills. A Medieval 
        Latin reading class will meet throughout the year. Elementary Old French 
        teaching is provided in Michaelmas and reading classes in Old French, 
        Early Middle English and advanced Middle English are held during the Michaelmas 
        and Lent terms. By taking advantage of the teaching offered by other faculties 
        and departments in the University (Anglo-Saxon, Norse, and Celtic, Modem 
        and Medieval Languages, History, Classics), students will have the opportunity 
        to learn any of a range of languages under expert guidance. Students will 
        also be able to attend lectures and classes in a variety of faculties 
        and departments (for example, Philosophy, Law, History of Art) to further 
        their interdisciplinary interests. </p>
      
    <p>The English Faculty&#8217;s Medieval Graduate Seminar meets twice a term 
      and provides the postgraduate students, faculty members and academic visitors 
      working in Cambridge with a regular opportunity to discuss recent work in 
      the field, to develop interdisciplinary contact and to hear speakers from 
      Cambridge and elsewhere. Papers have recently been offered by David Wallace 
      (University of Pennsylvania), Alastair Minnis (Ohio State), Paul Strohm 
      (Oxford), A. C. Spearing (University of Virginia), Ad Putter (University 
      of Bristol), Seth Lerer (Stanford), Mishtooni Bose (University of Southampton), 
      Corinne Saunders (Durham), Carolyn Dinshaw (New York University).</p>

      <h3>Interpretation of Literary Texts</h3>

      <img src="images/abstinence.jpg" width="121" height="195" align="right" alt="Abstinence" hspace="3" /> 
      This course offers an opportunity for students to explore literary texts 
      written in the period 1100-1550. Its aim is to train students in the particular 
      sensibilities and skills necessary for understanding Middle English texts 
      and the complex cultural background which lies behind them. Some parts of 
      the course will emphasize more canonical texts with a view to deepening 
      students' awareness of the more pressing issues in current scholarship; 
      other sessions will emphasize more obscure texts in order to guide students 
      to areas that might be profitably explored in an M. Phil. dissertation. 
      The seminar meets fortnightly in the first two terms of the year. </p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <h3>Middle English Manuscript Studies</h3>
      
    <p>The course is intended primarily to give students a practical introduction 
      to the study of English vernacular manuscripts in the period 1100-1500, 
      although many of the techniques taught are equally applicable to manuscripts 
      containing Latin and Anglo-Norman texts. Wherever possible, primary sources 
      from Cambridge collections are used to illustrate various aspects of the 
      subject. Principal components include the purpose and history of early English 
      manuscript studies, physical bibliography and codicology, palaeography, 
      the editorial process and textual criticism, manuscript studies and dialectology 
      (with reference to the Linguistic Atlas of Late Medieval English), transmission 
      from script to print, and current developments in Middle English editorial 
      and manuscript studies. Introduction to Bibliography for Medieval Research 
      This introductory course gives a practical guide to the most important reference 
      works and research tools available in the Medieval field, with explanation 
      and illustration of how to use the more complicated of them. Guidance in 
      scholarly presentation and methods of work is also provided.</p>

      <h2>THE RENAISSANCE COURSE<a id="renaissance" name="renaissance"></a></h2>
      
    <p><img src="images/june.jpg" width="259" height="159" align="right" alt="June" />The 
      interests of Faculty members range widely through the Renaissance period. 
      In addition to literary-critical and historical engagement with the major 
      English writers of drama, poetry and prose, they specialise in (for instance) 
      comparative literature, manuscript studies, textual bibliography, gender-studies, 
      intellectual history, politics and writing, drama, and critical theory. 
      Any proposal for a particular project falling within the general field of 
      Renaissance literary studies can be considered, including the literary inheritance 
      from the Medieval period. </p>
      <p>From the outset, graduate students will pursue individual research projects 
        with the guidance of a supervisor. They will attend classes on textual 
        and related studies, and on reading Renaissance manuscripts, as well as 
        a participatory seminar on the interpretation of literary texts. Students 
        interested in combining Renaissance with Medieval work will be encouraged 
        to attend classes and seminars on the earlier period. The University provides 
        classes in Latin, Greek and Hebrew for those who wish to learn those languages, 
        and there is scope for those with some knowledge to develop it. </p>
      <p>The English Faculty&#8217;s Renaissance Graduate Seminar meets fortnightly 
        and provides postgraduate students, faculty members, and academic visitors 
        working in Cambridge with a regular opportunity to discuss recent work 
        in the field, to develop interdisciplinary contact, and to hear speakers 
        from Cambridge and elsewhere. </p>
      <br />
      <h2>CLASSES AND SEMINARS OFFERED (Renaissance Course)<a id="renclass" 
      name="renclass"></a></h2>
      <h3>The Interpretation of Literary Texts </h3>
      <p><img src="images/shakes.jpg" width="232" height="228" align="left" alt="Shakespeare" hspace="3" />This 
        &#8216;approaches&#8217; class is concerned with questions of theory and 
        practice, with what was thought about writing in the Early Modem period 
        and what that literature can now mean. Recent contributions to the study 
        of major authors are assessed, and developments in, for example, &#8216;new 
        historicism&#8217;, theatre studies, humanism, and feminist criticism 
        may be considered. Other classes might consider, for example, ideas of 
        imitation, plagiarism, censorship, biography, and rhetoric in the period. 
        The class enables students to relate their own research to past and present 
        work in Renaissance studies. The seminar (which is informal in style) 
        helps students make contact with scholars in fields related to their own, 
        from whom advice and encouragement can be had.</p>
      <h3>Some Versions of the Renaissance</h3>
      <p>This seminar introduces students to the ways in which the Renaissance 
        has been conceived and characterised as a specific historical epoch. Seminar 
        participants read and discuss the foundational texts of Burkhardt, Marx, 
        Warburg and others, as well as the writings of the modern critics they 
        have influenced.</p>
      <h3>Textual and Related Studies</h3>
      <p><img src="images/donne.jpg" width="384" height="243" align="right" />These 
        lectures and classes focus on the ways in which text is changed in its 
        transmission from author to reader, and enable students to edit or to 
        assess the kind of text with which their research will be concerned. The 
        course teaches the essentials of descriptive bibliography and offers an 
        opportunity for specialised and technical work if that is desired. Within 
        a wider frame of reference, the implications of printing and the means 
        whereby print-culture developed will be explored. This element of the 
        course enables students to understand how, and for what purposes, texts 
        were produced, and how they function within the material culture of the 
        period. It also enables students to reflect on the theory and practice 
        of modern editing.</p>
      <h3>Reading Renaissance Manuscripts </h3>
      <p><img src="images/sidneypsal.jpg" width="156" height="205" align="left" alt="Sidney Psalms" hspace="3" />This 
        class equips students to read the scripts in which Renaissance literature 
        was written. Using original manuscripts as well as facsimiles, it introduces 
        techniques for analysing manuscript books and for making deductions of 
        literary consequence from hand-written material. New areas of research 
        opened up by manuscript studies are described and assessed. Less formally, 
        students are advised how to locate and gain access to manuscript holdings 
        relevant to their individual research. The course is supported by an excellent 
        <a href="http://www.english.cam.ac.uk/ceres/ehoc/">website</a>.</p>

      <h2>Entry requirements and application procedures<a id="applications"

      <p>You may find it helpful to find out about <a 
      href="Funding.htm">funding for home 
        students</a> or <a 
      href="OSFunding.htm">funding for 
        overseas students</a> before you apply. You should also consult our guide 
        for <a 
      href="Grad_Info.htm">prospective graduates</a>. All graduate students in 
        Cambridge are members of a College as well as of a Faculty of the University, 
        and those applying through the Board of Graduate Studies for a place on 
        the course will find themselves invited to list a number of Colleges in 
        order of preference. It is a good idea to consult the <a 
      href="http://www.cam.ac.uk/CambUniv/Finding/Addresses/college.html">prospectuses 
        of a number of Colleges</a> before you apply. </p>
      <p>Applications are first considered by the Faculty. Potential supervisors 
        are then consulted. Successful applications are then offered to the Colleges 
        of the student's choice, and may be then passed on to the second or third 
        choice. Since this can be a lengthy process it is very much in the interests 
        of applicants to apply in good time (and before the <strong>deadline for 
        applications of January 15th). </strong></p>
      <p>Applicants for funding should be aware that many funding bodies (e.g. 
        the <a href="http://www.ahrb.ac.uk">Arts and Humanities Research Council</a>) 
        require a firm acceptance from the University before they will consider 
        your application. If you hope to have a decision from the University in 
        time to apply for funding, you should apply well before the <strong>January 
        15th </strong>deadline. You may find it helpful in drawing up your funding 
        application to have had some discussion with the person assigned to be 
        your supervisor.</p>
      <p>Applicants should normally have a first-class honours degree or high 
        II.i , or its overseas/international equivalent. Applicants whose first 
        degrees are in other disciplines are always considered, provided they 
        can give an account of how their interest in literary study has developed. 
        We welcome qualified UK, EU, and overseas applicants (those for whom English 
        is not a first language will be required by the Board of Graduate Studies 
        to provide evidence of linguistic proficiency). </p>
      <p>Applicants should include specific proposals for advanced study or research 
        (of around 500 words). A piece of written work, of 5,000 - 7,500 words, 
        should accompany a formal application. Applicants may submit any work 
        they like, but it is worth choosing work which is recent and which relates 
        to your proposed area of study, if this is available. Many applicants 
        submit their undergraduate dissertation or similar extended piece of work. 
        In reaching decisions about applications the Degree Committee takes particular 
        account of: </p>
      <ul>
        <li><span class="mainbody">The applicant's academic record and references 
          </span> </li>
        <li><span class="mainbody">Their suitability for the proposed course (including 
          knowledge of foreign languages) </span> </li>
        <li><span class="mainbody">The applicant's research proposal, which should 
          suggest a realistic program of work for a 15,000 word dissertation. 
          </span> </li>
        <li><span class="mainbody">Whether a suitable supervisor can be found 
          for the proposed research </span> </li>
        <li><span class="mainbody">The written work which a candidate submits 
          in support of their application </span></li>
