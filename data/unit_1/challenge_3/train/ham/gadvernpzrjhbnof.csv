<P>
The results of simple experiments and systems studies have been used to develop
process-based models of nitrogen turnover in the soil/crop system.
<A HREF="sci.htm">SUNDIAL</A> is one such model (Bradbury et al, 1993;
Smith et al, 1996). It as a dynamic model with a weekly description of the
effects of different weather patterns, soil and crop types on nitrogen turnover.
<A HREF="sci.htm">SUNDIAL</A> is designed to be used in a
&#145;carry-forward&#146; mode, with information from one years run providing
inputs for the next. This allows it to investigate more complex systems involving
rotations of crops and planning timescales of several years
(<A HREF="wholefarm.htm">modelling whole farm systems</A>).
<A HREF="sci.htm">SUNDIAL</A> is also used in modelling
<A HREF="#Nitrate">nitrate leaching</A> from whole catchments
(<A HREF="catchment.htm">catchment modelling</A>).
<P>
Concentrations of nitrate in natural waters (rivers, lakes and underground
aquifers) have increased substantially over the last 30 years, and agricultural
land is recognised as a major source of nitrate in drinking water in the
United Kingdom (Archer and Thompson, 1993). Throughout the world there is
political and legislative pressure to reduce nitrate leaching from agricultural
land to meet maximum permitted concentrations of nitrate in drinking water.
The maximum concentration permitted by the 1980 EC Directive on the Quality
of Water Intended for Human Consumption is 50 mg nitrate l<SUP>-1</SUP> (Council of European Communities, 1980).
There is also concern over the amount of nitrate reaching rivers, lakes and
seas, which can cause algal blooms and eutrophication. &nbsp; The implementation
of the EC Drinking Water Directive requires nitrate losses associated with
agricultural management to be predicted. The
<A HREF="sci.htm">SUNDIAL</A> model can be used to predict nitrate
losses by simulating the dynamics of nitrogen turnover in the soil/crop system.
<A HREF="sunfrs.htm">SUNDIAL-FRS</A> can be used by farmers and advisors
to devise a management strategy to minimise nitrate losses for individual
farms.

<P>
Nitrogen fertiliser usually contains nitrogen in one of three forms - ammonium,
nitrate or urea. Once added to the soil, soil enzymes and microbes rapidly
convert any urea and ammonium to nitrate, particularly when the soil is moist
and reasonably warm. Nitrate is also produced from the breakdown of soil
organic matter and from any manure or plant residues.The nitrate ion (NO<SUB>3</SUB><SUP>-</SUP>)
is very soluble in water, and so is readily leached out of the soil by water
draining through it. Nitrate is lost to surface waters by run-off, or through
land drains and to groundwater by deep percolation. In the United Kingdom,
nitrate leaching occurs mainly in the autumn and winter, starting when soils
reach field capacity in the autumn and ending as they begin to dry in the
spring.
<P>
Plants absorb the nitrogen they need as ammonium or nitrate, so much of the
nitrogen in the soil that is available for crop uptake is therefore vulnerable
to leaching. This is the root of the &#145;nitrate problem&#146;. The key
to minimising nitrate leaching is to ensure that the supply of nitrogen to
the growing crop closely matches its demand, so that once the crop has ceased
to grow and absorb nitrate from the soil, little remains at risk of leaching.

<P>
<A HREF="sci.htm">SUNDIAL</A> started life as the Rothamsted Nitrogen
Turnover Model, intended to help scientists interpret nitrogen measurements
in field experiments (Bradbury et al, 1993). In particular it aimed to predict
how much nitrogen was released from the soil, and when this nitrogen release
occurred (Bradbury et al, 1991). This work was primarily funded by the Home-Grown
Cereals Authority (<A HREF="http://www.hgca.com/">HGCA</A>).
<A HREF="sci.htm">SUNDIAL</A> was developed as a user-friendly PC-based
version of the original model (Smith et al, 1996). It is designed to be used
both in retrospect, for example to compute nitrate losses from actual fertiliser
applications and weather data, and in predictive mode, using long-term weather
records or specified weather scenarios.
<P>
The development of <A HREF="sci.htm">SUNDIAL</A> into a nitrogen Fertiliser
Recommendation System (<A HREF="sunfrs.htm">SUNDIAL-FRS</A> ) was funded
primarily by <A HREF="http://www.maff.gov.uk/">MAFF</A>, in consultation
with members of the Association of Independent Crop Consultants (AICC) and
horticultural input from
<A HREF="http://www.imperial.ac.uk/wyecampus/">The Wye Campus of Imperial College London
</A>.
