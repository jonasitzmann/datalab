<br /><h1 align="center">About The New Building</h1>
            <p> <img src="new-building-charcoal.jpg" width="184" height="245" align="left" border="1" hspace="5" vspace="3" />Work 
              on a new building for the Faculty of English in West Road began 
              in July 2002 and was essentially complete in August of 2004. The 
              new building is on the site of the former Victorian villa and its 
              garden, and retains the same address, 9 West Road. The London-based 
              architectural partnership of Allies and Morrison designed the building 
              and worked closely with Wates Construction and a team of consultants 
              appointed by the University.</p>
<p>The Faculty's administrative staff began moving into it in late August and 
  early September and the teaching staff began moving into their offices in September. 
  We made the target date for the move, and were open in time for the start of 
  Michaelmas term 2004.</p>
<p>The building was funded by grants or donations from the alumni, the University, 
  the Higher Education Funding Council for England, charitable trusts, private 
  individuals and corporations. The Faculty's Building Committee worked 
  closely with the design team to ensure that the completed building is appropriate 
  for the Faculty's need.</p>
            <p><img src="new-building-photo.jpg" width="184" height="245" align="right" border="1" hspace="5" vspace="3" />The 
              building provides accommodation for the Faculty of English, the 
              Department of Anglo-Saxon, Norse, and Celtic, and for the Research 
              Centre for English and Applied Linguistics. It houses the faculty's 
              administrative offices, the Faculty Library, a drama studio and 
              provides IT and audio-visual facilities for teaching, research and 
              student use. There are meeting rooms, a courtyard garden and social 
              space in the form of both common rooms and an open area on the ground 
              floor that looks out onto the courtyard. The Faculty now has a building 
              that is appropriate for its size and suitable for the Faculty's 
              range of teaching, research and outreach activities. </p>
            <p>The building was opened officially in June 2005 by Her Majesty 
              the Queen; and in the same month was given a special award in the 
              Royal Fine Arts Commission's 'Building of the Year' competition.</p>
