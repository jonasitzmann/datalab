                    <p>Our aim is to offer whatever support you need to achieve 
                      your potential because at Trinity and All Saints everyone 
                      is respected for their individuality and encouraged to make 
                      their own contribution to the College community.</p>
                    <p>&#8226; We aim to offer you the additional support you 
                      might need if you have a disability, medical condition, 
                      or a specific learning difficulty such as <a href="dyslexic.htm">dyslexia</a></p>
                    <p>&#8226;We may be able to offer you support if you have 
                      a temporary disability (for example, broken arm)</p>
                    <p>&#8226; If you have a mental health concern we will be 
                      happy to discuss this with you and help you identify appropriate 
                      sources of support.</p>
                    <p>&#8226; We recommend that you to come and visit us before 
                      you apply to College, so we can discuss how we may best 
                      support you.<br>

                    <p class="bodytext">Trinity and All Saints prides itself on 
                      having a wide range of assessment methods, which increases 
                      the opportunity for all students to demonstrate their full 
                      potential. Students with disabilities, like all other students, 
                      have difficulties in some areas and strengths in others. 
                      The types of assessment already in place include examinations, 
                      assessed essays, group work and media production, to name 
                      but a few.<br>
                      <br>
                      We can also make individual arrangements depending on your 
                      particular needs. Examples of these include extra time in 
                      examinations, use of a scribe or a laptop in examinations 
                      and, in exceptional circumstances, extensions to deadlines 
                      for coursework.<br>
                      <br>
                      You will need to provide <strong>evidence</strong> of your 
                      entitlement to these concessions, for example a medical 
                      or psychologist&#8217;s report. You will need to supply 
                      relevant supporting evidence to Registry no less than two 
                      weeks <strong>before the start of the </strong>examination 
                      period. <br>

                      If you wish to extend an essay deadline, this has to be 
                      agreed by your tutors in advance.</p>
