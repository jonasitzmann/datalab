Abstract:
</H4>

<p>
Some researches are described concerning early work on the transient self-magnetic "pinch effect" at both high and low pressures. Theoretical work motivated by interest in shock waves led to the discovery in 1958 of solitary waves in plasma physics; they were later to be known as solitons.
