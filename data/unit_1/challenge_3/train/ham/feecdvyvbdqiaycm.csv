		<h2>THE CREATIVE FUTURES FUND - ENRICHING THE STUDENT EXPERIENCE</h2><p>Amazing is a word often used to describe The Glasgow School of Art.  But so is inspiring, innovative and intuitive.  To say nothing of exciting, exhilarating and exceptional.  </p><p>Indeed, if accolades were money, we'd be the richest art school in the world.  But, unfortunately, they're not.  Which is why we need your help.  </p><p>With the support of our alumni and friends, we can ensure that the GSA continues to break new ground in the study of fine art, design and architecture.  The Creative Futures Fund will help us achieve this aim by providing unrestricted funds which can be directed where they are needed most across the School.</p><p>We have achieved much at the GSA.  We want to achieve even more.  The Creative Futures Fund is a unique opportunity for alumni and friends of the GSA to help the next generation of artists, designers and architects realise their full potential.  It will ensure that all students are able to benefit from the same quality of learning, teaching and opportunity as those who have gone before.  </p><p>For example, your support could help the Library increase its provision for students with disabilities - significantly improving their access to learning materials - or could match support from the School's own resources to provide advanced IT facilities or specialist equipment across the GSA.  It could help facilitate student access to lectures and seminars by international artists, designers and architects, which may not currently be possible.</p><p>Facilities like these should be an integral part of our students' day-to-day life - not luxuries to be dreamt about.  With your help, we can make them a reality.  Whatever the size of your donation, you can be assured that it will have a direct and positive impact on both today's students and those yet to walk through our doors.</p><p>Not only that, but a commitment on your part will serve to strengthen our approaches to major funding bodies such as trusts, foundations and companies.  By demonstrating the wholehearted backing of the GSA community, we can show other potential supporters that the people who know it best - you, our alumni and friends - care enough about its future to contribute to it.  With your help, we will ensure that the GSA continues to make its influence felt across the globe. </p><p>One of the best ways to support the Creative Futures Fund is through a regular donation, either monthly or annually, through Gift Aid (if you are a UK taxpayer).  If just 100 alumni and friends chose to support the Creative Futures Fund with a donation of &pound;10 per month for four years, the Fund would grow by over &pound;61,500.</p><p>Alternatively, you can make a one-off donation to the Fund, again through Gift Aid, maximising the value of your donation.</p><p>However you choose to support the Creative Futures Fund, you can be confident in the knowledge that you will making a significant difference to current and future students of the GSA.  With your help, GSA students will continue to make their mark on the world in the years to come.</p><p>Support the Creative Futures Fund Now</p><h2>MORE INFORMATION?</h2><p>For further information on the Creative Futures Fund, and methods of giving, please contact us at:</p><p>Development &amp; External Relations Office<br />The Glasgow School of Art<br />167 Renfrew Street<br />Glasgow <br />G3 6RQ</p><p>+44 (0)141 353 4788<br />+44 (0)141 353 4401<br /><a href="mailto:dero@gsa.ac.uk" target=""><u>dero@gsa.ac.uk</u></a></p>
