			<P>With effect from Monday 4th September 2006, Carlisle Managed Solutions (CMS) is the new contracted neutral vendor service for all supply teachers and agency staff. </P>
<P>As a Neutral Vendor CMS offers a solution that differs from other solutions in that we act as an intermediary between suppliers and schools and do not supply staff directly. This allows us to negotiate rates and contract services on your behalf with terms and conditions defined by the requirements of the local authority.</P>
