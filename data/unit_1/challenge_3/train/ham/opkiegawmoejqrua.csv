		<p>As one of the leading Art Schools in the UK, The Glasgow School of Art welcomes international students to all of its courses. The School offers an environment in which difference is encouraged and diversity of background and approach is valued. </p><p>Study at the GSA is done through one of three Schools: Fine Art; Design; and the Mackintosh School of Architecture. The focus of all courses is studio practice, and whilst not all students at GSA get allotted studio space in the famous Mackintosh Building, the provision of individual studio space to both undergraduate and postgraduate students, is one of our major strengths, as is individual tuition. All students, whilst developing their own work independently, will benefit from valuable one on one time from tutors. Courses also include lecture time, library research and "crits" time when students work in groups with tutors to analyse and explain their work.</p><p>International students at the School come from over 55 countries, ranging from Australia to Zimbabwe. Each year we welcome more than 80 students from our exchange and Study Abroad partners, who each, in their turn, further contribute to the international dimension of the learning experience at the School.</p><p>As a relatively small institution, and one that is very focused, we are a creative community, situated in the centre of the city of Glasgow. Students are encouraged to engage with Glasgow which becomes more than just the city in which to live. It becomes a source of both inspiration and research. Glasgow is home to over 80,000 students at its 5 institutions of higher education, which might explain why it's been voted Britain's best student city. International students will find Glaswegians friendly, and the city is renowned for offering a warm welcome</p><p>We are delighted that you are considering making The Glasgow School of Art your creative home and hope that this website will be useful to you in providing the information you need to help make your choice to study here. We are confident that once you arrive you won't be disappointed.</p>
