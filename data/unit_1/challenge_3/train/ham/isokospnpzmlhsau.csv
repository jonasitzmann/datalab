      YOU</font></a></h3>
    <h4 align="justify"><a name="2" id="2">Vocation</a> </h4>
    </i></b> 
    <p align="justify">The most important qualification for becoming a graduate 
      student is a sense of vocation. Finishing a dissertation is hard work; it 
      is also a test of determination. In deciding if graduate work is for you 
      it is valuable to consider which elements in your undergraduate course you 
      most enjoyed. It is not enough to have relished the excitement of reading 
      new material each week and cleverly concealing what you did not know in 
      your essays or coursework - although an enthusiasm for reading is one vital 
      qualification for graduate work. If you felt frustrated about the limits 
      of your knowledge when you were an undergraduate, and enjoyed the more extended 
      forms of study which were required for a dissertation or extended essay, 
      then it is likely that you will get satisfaction from graduate work. All 
      graduate students are assigned an individual supervisor, but a very high 
      level of self-motivation is expected of all graduate students, including 
      those on one year M.Phil. courses.</p>
    <b><i> 
    <h4 align="justify"><a name="3" id="3">Qualifications</a></h4>
    </i></b> 
    <p align="justify">Most of our graduate students have a first class undergraduate 
      degree or equivalent. If you are a home student and you do not have a first 
      class degree or a strong expectation of achieving one then it is unfortunately 
      quite unlikely that you will be awarded a maintenance grant from the <a href="http://www.ahrb.ac.uk/">AHRC</a>. 
      The Faculty is willing in principle to accept candidates with 2.1s, or mature 
      students who have not pursued an orthodox pattern of higher education, provided 
      that such applicants have strong backing from their referees, have a feasible 
      topic, and are well qualified for their proposed course of research. We 
      recognise both that things sometimes do not go candidatesÂ’ way in examinations 
      and that a sparkling examination style is not always the best qualification 
      for graduate work.</p>
    <b><i> 
    <h4 align="justify"><a name="4" id="4">Funding</a></h4>
    </i></b> 
    <p align="justify"> Funding for graduate work in the humanities is increasingly 
      difficult to obtain. For home students a first class degree is no longer 
      a guarantee of winning a maintenance grant from the <a href="http://www.ahrc.ac.uk/">AHRC</a>. 
      You may need either a high first or to put in a very strong performance 
      in the area of your proposed research. If you are considering supporting 
      yourself through your graduate career you should be aware of the costs. 
      Up to date details of fees and charges can be found in the <a href="http://www.admin.cam.ac.uk/univ/gsprospectus/">Graudate 
      Prospectus</a>. The <a href="http://www.admin.cam.ac.uk/offices/gradstud/">Board 
      of Graduate Studies</a> (the body which administers graduate study in the 
      University) requires you to provide evidence that you will be able to support 
      yourself through your course before you are finally admitted. If the money 
      runs out during your course there are a very limited number of scholarships 
      and bursaries available from the University and Colleges. The Faculty also 
      has a number of prizes and awards for graduate students. However none of 
      these supplementary sources of funding can be relied upon as a means of 
      support, so it is essential to ensure that you have reliable sources of 
      funding before you arrive.</p>
    <b><i> 
    <h4 align="justify"><a name="5" id="5">Topic</a></h4>
    </i></b> 
    <p align="justify">All of our graduate courses require you to give a detailed 
      description of the proposed topic of your dissertation. This enables us 
      to be sure that we have a suitable supervisor for you, and enables us to 
      judge the level of your present knowledge of your field. About 500 words 
      is a suitable length for a research proposal. The space provided on the 
      standard application form is not adequate. What you propose should be manageable 
      within the period of your course, it should be coherent, and have potential 
      to be a contribution to knowledge. We attach considerable weight to the 
      research proposal when we are selecting candidates for admission. It is 
      therefore worth seeking advice from those who are teaching you at present 
      about how to formulate your topic. It is also worth attempting to locate 
      what you propose to do in relation to existing secondary material in the 
      subject area. You should ask yourself how your work might change the present 
      state of scholarship in your field, and whether the topic is well suited 
      to the resources provided at Cambridge. Even for M.Phil. courses we generally 
      aim to admit not just those who propose a sensible topic, but those who 
      are aware of and who have the potential to modify the present paradigms 
      of research in their field. Most students, though, refine their proposed 
      research topics after they arrive in the light of what they discover or 
      of advice they may be given by their supervisor, so you need not feel that 
      you are inscribing your future in tablets of stone as you compose your proposal.</p>
    <b><i> 
    <h4 align="justify"><a name="6" id="6">Written Work</a></h4>
    </i></b> 
    <p align="justify">We require all applicants to submit a recent sample of 
      written work of 5,000 to 7,500 words in support of their application. Normally 
      applications will not be considered unless this is included. Our assessment 
      of the critical flair, scholarly integrity, and originality of the written 
      work carries great weight in the admission procedure, although we assess 
      the work in conjunction with your references, your proposed topic, and your 
      academic record to date. It is sensible to choose a piece of work which 
      is at least roughly in the subject area in which you plan to do research. 
      We are always impressed by high standards of presentation, but you should 
      aim to submit your most imaginative and original work, even if it does not 
      contain detailed footnotes or scholarly apparatus. </p>
    <b><i> 
    <h4 align="justify"><a name="7" id="7">When you arrive</a></h4>
    </i></b> 
    <p align="justify">There are some technical requirements for research degrees 
      in Cambridge of which you should be aware. Graduate students are required 
      to reside in Cambridge for the duration of their course (three terms for 
      M.Phil. students, six terms for M.Litt. students, and nine terms for Ph.D. 
      students). Students also have to be accepted by one of the Colleges before 
      they can come into residence. Your choice of College will have a major effect 
      on the kind of accommodation that you are offered while you are here, and 
      the kinds of sporting, computing and social facilities which you will be 
      able to enjoy. These vary a great deal from College to College, so it is 
      well worth spending an hour or so familiarising yourself with a number of 
      prospectuses. These can be obtained directly from the Colleges concerned, 
      or via the <a href="http://www.cam.ac.uk/cambuniv/colleges.html">colleges' 
      websites</a>. </p>
    <p align="justify"></p>
    <p align="justify">We expect a very high level of achievement and application 
      from our students. They are expected regularly to produce written work of 
      a high standard, to respond positively to suggestions from their supervisor, 
      and to work well on their own. Students who are working towards a Ph.D. 
      are usually expected to produce at least one substantial piece of written 
      work each term (and it is always in the studentÂ’s interest that chapters 
      or drafts of chapters should be steadily accumulating throughout the nine 
      terms of study for the degree). M.Phil. students usually are required by 
      their course to produce at least one piece of written work each term. We 
      expect the highest standards of accuracy and presentation, even at the early 
      stages of a graduate studentÂ’s work.</p>
    <p align="justify"></p>
    <p align="justify">Cambridge provides everything necessary to make your time 
      as a graduate student the most enjoyably educational period of your life. 
      It does require you to contribute actively, however, in driving your work 
      along, seeking out friends through College and University Societies, and 
      in acknowledging and actively seeking to rectify any gaps in your knowledge 
      or research skills. Everything is here: you need to have the energy to find 
      it, and above all a commitment to your subject.</p>

      study in all areas of English Literature. You can expect to be in regular 
      contact with acknowledged authorities in your chosen field, and to have 
      access to resources for research which are among the best in the world. 
      We usually admit around seventy graduate students from all around the world 
      each year, who should be among the brightest people in higher education. 
      The Cambridge University Library is one of only three copyright libraries 
      in England. It can be relied upon to contain the vast majority of twentieth 
      century printed materials on most topics, and a large number of early printed 
      books and manuscripts. It also subscribes to a growing number of electronic 
      resources (such as the Chadwyck-Healey Literature Online service and the 
      MLA Bibliography online) which are available to all students in the University. 
      The Faculty and your supervisor will provide you with guidance about how 
      best to use these resources.</p>
    <b><i> 
    <h4 align="justify"><a name="9" id="9">Admissions</a></h4>
    </i></b> 
    </font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font>
    <p align="justify"><font size="3">We treat all applications made to us equally, and we consider 
      them as swiftly as possible. In considering applications we take equal account 
      of your academic record, your written work, your proposal, and whether we 
      can provide first class supervision in your area. Competition is intense. 
      If you have a query about your application you can contact The Director 
      of Graduate Studies, 9 West Road, Cambridge CB3 9DP, tel. 01223 335076 (email: 
      <a href="mailto:dah54@cam.ac.uk">dah54@cam.ac.uk</a>). We normally reply 
      to queries within five working days. <strong>The deadline for the submission 
      of applications for M.Phil. courses is 15th January</strong>. Owing to the 
      large number of applications which we receive we cannot guarantee to inform 
      you of the result of the application before early March, but we will try 
      to do so if you have an urgent need to know. Ph.D. applicants intending 
      to start on 1 October should also try to apply by 15th January.</font></p>

    <h4 align="justify"><a name="10" id="10">Supervision</a></h4>
    </i></b> 
    <p align="justify">You should be assigned a supervisor before or on your arrival 
      in Cambridge. The supervisor can be expected to be a specialist in the general 
      field in which you propose to work, although he or she cannot be expected 
      to know about every aspect of the topic on which you hope to work. Your 
      supervisor will assist you in refining your research topic, will oversee 
      the general direction of your work, and should give you a clear indication 
      of whether what you are doing is up to the standard normally expected for 
      the degree towards which you are working. You can reasonably expect to meet 
      your supervisor on average once a month to report on your progress, and 
      more frequently than this if you are starting work on a Ph.D. Most supervisors 
      expect you to make contact with them rather than vice versa, and it is important 
      not to allow yourself to go for longer than a term without a meeting. Most 
      supervisors like to see at least one substantial piece of written work each 
      term. </p>
    <p align="justify">If you are taking an M.Phil. course meetings might be less 
      frequent in the part of the year (usually the first two terms) in which 
      you are doing the bulk of the coursework and might be more frequent in the 
      part of the year in which you are preparing your dissertation. It is usual 
      practice for students to remain with the same supervisor for the whole of 
      their course. There are inevitably some circumstances in which this cannot 
      be guaranteed: if your supervisor goes on leave you will be temporarily 
      assigned to another expert in the field; if your topic evolves in a new 
      direction you may benefit from moving to someone else; if, as occasionally 
      happens, a relationship with a supervisor does not work it is clearly desirable 
      to transfer to another supervisor. There are occasions too when students 
      feel that they would benefit from a fresh perspective, and supervisors can 
      offer advice about ways of making contact with other members of the Faculty, 
      or with academics in other Faculties or other universities in order to broaden 
      the base of a studentÂ’s knowledge.</p>
    <p align="justify">In addition to their supervisor, Ph.D. students are assigned 
      an advisor, who is a member of the Faculty with expertise in the studentÂ’s 
      field. The student has a formal advisory meeting with the supervisor and 
      the advisor once a year. The advisor is also available for less formal consultation 
      from the outset. M.Phil. students do not have formal advisors in addition 
      to their supervisors, but the Assistant Director of Graduate Studies (discussed 
      in the next section) and the members of the Faculty responsible for organising 
      each M.Phil. course are always happy to offer advice and support.</p>
    <b><i> 
    <h4 align="justify"><a name="11" id="11">Faculty Support</a></h4>
    </i></b> 
    <p align="justify">Three academic officers in the Faculty have particular 
      responsibility for graduate work: The Director of Graduate Studies oversees 
      the general running of graduate courses, and is always available to see 
      students who encounter difficulties or who have queries about their course; 
      the Assistant Director of Graduate Studies has particular responsibility 
      for students who are taking one year M.Phil. courses; the Chairman of the 
      Degree Committee has overall responsibility for graduate affairs in the 
      Faculty. In addition to these officers the Faculty has a full-time graduate 
      administrative assistant who is a very helpful source of advice and support 
      to students. Graduate representatives on the Faculty Board ensure that the 
      views of graduate students are heard in the Faculty, and a Graduate Consultative 
      Committee meets regularly to discuss matters of concern to students. The 
      Faculty runs a wide range of graduate seminars, which cover all of the major 
      areas of work (each period has its own seminar; in addition there are normally 
      seminars on literary theory, gender studies, Commonwealth literature, American 
      literature, drama, race and class, psychoanalysis and the humanities, and 
      the history of the book). These provide a forum for students to hear recent 
      work by scholars in each of these fields, as well as giving a chance for 
      Ph.D. students to give papers which relate to their own researches. There 
      is also a Graduate Research Forum, run by graduates, which addresses research 
      and career issues. Seminars are often also social occasions, and many are 
      followed by informal gatherings after they have formally ended. The quality 
      of all aspects of graduate study is regularly monitored, and questionnaires 
      soliciting feedback from students are regularly circulated.</p>
    <b><i> 
    <h4 align="justify"><a name="12" id="12">Courses of teaching</a></h4>
    </i></b> 
    <p align="justify">You will be told about the teaching arrangements for your 
      course within the first week of your first term. You will be told which 
      elements in your chosen course are compulsory and which are optional, and 
      you will receive information about a range of additional classes and facilities 
      in the University that you might find useful. As a member of the University 
      you will be able to attend any undergraduate lectures which interest you 
      in the English Faculty or other Faculties (e.g. History, Philosophy, Modern 
      and Medieval Languages). The start of your graduate career is an ideal time 
      to fill in any gaps which you have in your knowledge, or to acquire any 
      ancillary skills, such as languages or computing skills, which will help 
      you later in your career. Excellent language laboratories, computing facilities 
      and libraries provide resources for anyone who wishes to develop their knowledge 
      in any of these areas. You will receive guidance about the resources for 
      research (printed and electronic) available to you and how to use them.</p>
    <b><i> 
    <h4 align="justify"><a name="13" id="13">Faculty facilities</a></h4>
    </i></b> 
    <p align="justify">Although graduate research revolves around independent 
      study, it needn't be a solitary experience. The English Faculty building 
      at 9 West Road, a step away from the University Library, provides a place 
      where you can meet and work alongside other English graduates. In addition 
      to the English Faculty library, which graduates are welcome to use, there 
      is a special graduate study area, with computers and lockers, and a graduate 
      common room. Many lecturers have offices in the faculty building, and the 
      building also houses a drama studio, seminar and supervision rooms, social 
      spaces and the Degree Committee office, which is the first port of call 
      for graduate queries. The faculty also has a limited number of laptop computers 
      for loan to graduate students.</p>
    <h4 align="justify"><a name="13" id="13">College and other support</a></h4></i></b> 
    Colleges provide a range of social and sporting facilities, as well as varying 
    levels of accommodation and of computing facilities. Colleges usually have 
    a Tutor for Graduates, who can offer help with personal or financial difficulties. 
    If for any reason students find it awkward to discuss any matter with their 
    supervisor a Graduate Tutor can often provide an additional level of support. 
    Some Colleges may also have some funds available for attending conferences 
    and similar academic needs. The University Counselling service also offers 
    confidential support to graduate students. 
    <h4 align="justify"><a name="14" id="14"><i><font size="2">WHAT YOU CANNOT 
      EXPECT FROM US</font></i></a></h4>
    <b><i></i></b> 
    <p align="justify">Most of our graduate students find their time here strenuous 
      but rewarding. Most would accept that what they have got out of their course 
      is in direct proportion to what they have put in.</p>
    <p align="justify">If the career of a graduate student does not go well it 
      is usually because they either do not enjoy working for the majority of 
      their time on their own, or because they arrive in the expectation of receiving 
      a more directive form of education from us than we usually offer. Do not 
      expect to be spoon-fed while you are here. You will spend long hours in 
      the library working on a topic which on a black day might seem to be of 
      interest to noone else in the world. You should bear in mind that you will 
      probably be poor, and that you will almost certainly have to spend a great 
      deal of time reading material which you find unappetising in order to master 
      your chosen field. Your supervisor will help you clarify your ideas, will 
      make sure that your work is on target for swift completion, will reassure 
      you that your work is up to the required standard, and will stop you careering 
      down blind alleys. Your supervisor will also give you access to the information 
      and resources which should enable you to produce first class research; but 
      he or she will not write your thesis. Noone will make you take advantage 
      of all the range of educational facilities that are available, although 
      we hope that everyone whom we accept will be fully able to do so. </p>
    <p align="justify">We aim to produce a high proportion of graduate students 
      who go on to successful careers in higher education. Those who do so, and 
      many of those who do not, recognise that their period of graduate research 
      laid the foundations for all of their subsequent thinking and writing. Your 
      graduate career is the one point in your life when you can direct your reading 
      and concentrate on nothing else. Only you can make sure that you make the 
      best possible use of it.</p>
