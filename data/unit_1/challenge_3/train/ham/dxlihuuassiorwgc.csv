<h2>Facilities</h2>

<p>The sub-department is located in an <a
href="../dept/history.html">historic building</a> situated within the
University of Oxford's Science Area and near the town centre. It can
be conveniently reached by both <a
href="../dept/gettinghere.html">road</a> and <a
href="http://www.nationalrail.co.uk/planmyjourney/">rail</a>. The
challenge over the past 25 years has been to turn a Victorian building
into a modern, well-equippped laboratory, and this has been achieved
by extensive <a href="building_modifications.html">modifications</a>
to both the structure and the layout of the building. The resulting
changes have produced a compact laboratory incorporating all the
facilities and services needed to support the design, development and
testing of space instrumentation.</p>

<p>The schematic shown in Fig&#160;1 provides an overview of the facilities
and services provided on-site. The department's large test and
calibration facilities, the <a
href="2point2_metre_facility/index.html">2.2 metre
facility</a> and the <a href="1point6_metre_chamber.html">1.6 metre
facility</a>, each housing thermal vacuum chambers, are supported by a
common control room.  Small, but well equipped <a
href="mechanical.html">mechanical</a> and <a
href="electronics.html">electronic</a> workshops are located close-by
and provide the manufacturing and maintenance expertise needed to
maintain and re-configure the thermal vacuum chambers. The workshops
are also used in the manufacture and integration of space
instrumentation at all levels, from working prototype to qualified
flight hardware.</p>

<p>In close proximity to both the workshops and test facilities are the
department's clean <a href="vibration_testing.html">vibration test
facility</a> and <a href="clean_assembly_area.html">clean
assembly area</a>. The latter is used to assemble and test sub-systems
and small instruments. The inter-connected nature of the facilities
and services allows for rapid prototyping, modification and repair,
with a minimum of transfer of flight hardware off-site.</p>

<p>Facilities for coating and <a
href="http://www.physics.ox.ac.uk/electronics/pfu/pfu-web-page-dr-weave-htm.htm">photofabrication</a>
are also available from within the Physics Department and have been
used extensively in the fabrication of flight hardware. In particular,
low-thermal conductivity cryogenic harnesses for detector arrays have
been successfully manufactured for several projects, using
photofabrication techniques.</p>
