Abstract:
</H4>

<p>
In recent years various models for packet traffic in networks have
been developed.  The models used Poisson-like traffic sources
which replicate traffic that is typically <I>voice</I> type. Such
sources are said to be  <I>short-range-dependent</I> (SRD). In this
paper we describe nonlinear methods for producing packet traffic
models which can replicate both SRD streams and Internet/video
traffic which is said to be  <I>long range dependent</I>. Various
statistical properties of the output of these maps will be
considered and their use will be illustrated in network modelling
to show up some of the problems of  congestion onset.
