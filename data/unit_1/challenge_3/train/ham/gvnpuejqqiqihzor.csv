      <h3 align="justify"><b>Course Overview<a name="overview" id="overview"></a></b></h3>
      <p align="justify">The M.Phil. in American Literature at the University 
        of Cambridge is a nine month course, which runs from October to June. 
        It is designed particularly for students wishing to approach the subject 
        from a secure foundation in the study of English literature. The focus 
        is on literary texts in their historical and intellectual contexts, as 
        seen in both generic and chronological perspectives. The course is cumulative 
        and self-contained, involves written exercises during the year, and leads 
        to a dissertation on a topic of the students choice. It aims to equip 
        each student with a firm historical and literary base, together with appropriate 
        research skills.</p>
      <p align="justify"></p>
      <p align="justify">The context of the American M.Phil. will thus be the 
        larger study of literature within the Faculty of English. This will allow 
        the course to draw upon the traditional strengths of the Cambridge English 
        Faculty, as well as allowing students to attend lectures or seminars on 
        a wide range of complementary subjects, from Elizabethan or Victorian 
        literature through to postcolonial writing and critical theory. M.Phil. 
        students participate in the American Graduate Seminar, held fortnightly 
        throughout the academic year, which features presentations by postgraduate 
        students or visiting faculty followed by informal discussion. Students 
        research is also faciliated by the holdings of the University Library, 
        one of only five copyright libraries in the United Kingom, which is supplemented 
        by the English Faculty Library as well as libraries within individual 
        colleges.</p>
      <p align="justify">Under normal circumstances, students will not normally 
        be permitted to register for Ph.D. research in American or Anglo-American 
        subjects unless they have completed the M.Phil. in American Literature 
        (or a similar postgraduate course) at an appropriate standard. </p>
      <h3 align="justify"><b>Course of Study<a name="study" id="study"></a></b></h3>
      <p align="justify"></p>
      <ol type="A">
        <li>RESOURCES AND METHODS FOR AMERICANISTS.</li>
        <p align="justify">A series of four seminars on information resources, 
          scholarly methods, textual editing and the professional development 
          of American literary studies. A compulsory requirement, but not formally 
          assessed.</p>
        <li>TEXTS AND CONTEXTS IN AMERICAN LITERATURE.</li>
        <p align="justify">A fortnightly seminar running through Michaelmas and 
          Lent Terms, which is designed to provide a critical background to the 
          field of American literature. Recent topics have included: Puritans 
          and Others 1630-1700; Enlightenment and Revolution, 1700-1800; Explorations 
          1800-1860; Realism and its Discontents, 1860-1900; The Melting Pot: 
          Immigration and National Identity 1920-25; Human Documentary: Depression, 
          New Deal and Wartime, 1925-45; Aesthetics of the Cold War, 1945-65; 
          American Identities 1970-present day.</p>
        <li>PERIOD CLASSES </li>
        <p>Michaelmas Term: 1845-1855 (four classes)</p>
        <p>Lent Term: 1915-1925 (four classes)</p>
        <p align="justify">The period classes are designed to involve a close 
          study of the literature falling within a span of ten years or so, with 
          particular emphasis on specified texts and their relation to each other 
          and to the history of which they form a part. The current periods are 
          1845 to 1855 and 1915 to 1925. The earlier period aims to introduce 
          students to a variety of genres and texts including both canonical and 
          more marginal works. It might survey such topics as the representation 
          of nature, the Gothic, Transcendentalism, slave narratives, and the 
          development of the American poetic voice. Recent set texts have included 
          <i>The Blithedale Romance</i>, <i>Narrative of the Life of Frederick 
          Douglass</i> and poems by Whitman and Longfellow. The later period takes 
          up such matters as the development of American modernism, the role of 
          little magazines, experimental prose and the Harlem Renaissance, with 
          reference to such works as <i>Spring and All</i>, <i>Harmonium</i>, 
          <i>in our time</i> and <i>Cane</i>. Other issues that may be considered 
          here are literary reactions to economic and cultural change from novelists 
          such as Dos Passos, and the challenge to Broadway of alternative theatres 
          and the plays of Eugene O'Neill.</p>
        <p align="justify">The periods designated for these classes change from 
          time to time, depending on the availability and research interests of 
          academic staff. </p>
        <li>DISSERTATION 
          <p align="justify">In consultation with a supervisor, each student works 
            throughout the year on a dissertation of 10,000 - 15,000 words on 
            a subject of his or her choice. A bibliography relevant to this dissertation 
            is required by the end of Michaelmas term (early December), and the 
            completed dissertation must be submitted for examination by the end 
            of Easter Term (mid June).</p>

      <p>You may find it helpful to find out about <a 
      href="Funding.htm">funding for home 
        students</a> or <a 
      href="OSFunding.htm">funding for 
        overseas students</a> before you apply. You should also consult our guide 
        for <a 
      href="Grad_Info.htm">prospective 
        graduates</a>. All graduate students in Cambridge are members of a College 
        as well as of a Faculty of the University, and those applying through 
        the Board of Graduate Studies for a place on the course will find themselves 
        invited to list a number of Colleges in order of preference. It is a good 
        idea to consult the <a 
      href="http://www.cam.ac.uk/CambUniv/Finding/Addresses/college.html">prospectuses 
        of a number of Colleges</a> before you apply. </p>
      <p>Applications are first considered by the Faculty. Potential supervisors 
        are then consulted. Successful applications are then offered to the Colleges 
        of the student's choice, and may be then passed on to the second or third 
        choice. Since this can be a lengthy process it is very much in the interests 
        of applicants to apply in good time (and before the <strong>deadline for 
        applications of January 15th). </strong></p>
      <p>Applicants for funding should be aware that many funding bodies (e.g. 
        the <a href="http://www.ahrb.ac.uk">Arts and Humanities Research Council</a>) 
        require a firm acceptance from the University before they will consider 
        your application. If you hope to have a decision from the University in 
        time to apply for funding, you should apply well before the <strong>January 
        15th </strong>deadline. You may find it helpful in drawing up your funding 
        application to have had some discussion with the person assigned to be 
        your supervisor.</p>
      <p>Applicants should normally have a first-class honours degree or high 
        II.i , or its overseas/international equivalent. Applicants whose first 
        degrees are in other disciplines are always considered, provided they 
        can give an account of how their interest in literary study has developed. 
        We welcome qualified UK, EU, and overseas applicants (those for whom English 
        is not a first language will be required by the Board of Graduate Studies 
        to provide evidence of linguistic proficiency). </p>
      <p>Applicants should include specific proposals for advanced study or research 
        (of around 500 words). A piece of written work, of 5,000 - 7,500 words, 
        should accompany a formal application. Applicants may submit any work 
        they like, but it is worth choosing work which is recent and which relates 
        to your proposed area of study, if this is available. Many applicants 
        submit their undergraduate dissertation or similar extended piece of work. 
        In reaching decisions about applications the Degree Committee takes particular 
        account of: </p>
      <ul>
        <li><span class="mainbody">The applicant's academic record and references 
          </span> </li>
