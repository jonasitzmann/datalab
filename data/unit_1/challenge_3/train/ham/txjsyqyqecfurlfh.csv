The session started with a series of talks on the theme of
the downward phase propagation of the Artic Oscillation.
<B> O'Neill </B> and Berrisford questioned whether the AO was a ``physical
mode'', given that the dynamics involved are fundamentally
non-linear and asymmetric, whereas the AO is a symmetric
mode which is derived from a linear statistical analysis.
He also questioned the validity of the usual approach of
treating the stratosphere and troposphere as distinct systems.
<B> Kodera </B> and Kuroda showed that the first and second EOFs of
15 day mean zonal mean wind evolve in a coherent cycle, with
a period of about 4 months. The cycle produces the characteristic
downward phase propagation of the AO. <B> Perlwitz</B> reiterated
the point that the standard statistical tools (EOFs, SVD and CCA)
are all essentially linear and will not necessarily represent the
underlying non-linear dynamical structures. It was shown that 
dynamically meaningful results could be obtaind by separating
strongly perturbed from weakly perturbed events before calculating the
statistics. A weak vortex was associated with a strong upward
propagating signal, a strong vortex on the other hand, produced 
a downward propagating signal.
<B> Christiansen</B> presented diagnostics from a hierarchy of systems
ranging from a minimal model through the Holton-Mass model, a
perpetual January GCM and a GCM with annual cycle to the full stratospheric
system as represented in the NCEP reanalyses.
Both the minimal model and the Holton-Mass model could be shown to produce
vacillations at large forcing amplitudes related to a Hopf bifurcation.
Hopf bifurcation behaviour was also found in the perpetual January GCM.
A series of experiments where carried out with this model in which
a perturbation was introduced at a range of levels and the ensemble
response diagnosed. Interestingly, the initial response was barotropic
but after 70 days a downward propagating signal appeared.

<P>
<B> Plumb</B> disagreed with some of the above, suggesting that the 
downward phase propagation of the AO signal was simply an artifact
of the greater inertia at lower levels: the lower levels respond 
more slowly and hence later than upper levels. This view was supported
by some calculations with the Holton-Mass model which showed that the
response at lower levels was insensitive to changes at upper levels
created by imposing strong damping. Moving onto the forcing of the
Brewer-Dobson circulation he noted a contradiction between the theory
often used to describe the non-linear mixing in the mid and upper
stratosphere, which would imply that the mixing should be centred
on the zero wind line, and the actuality in which the mixing is confined
poleward of that line. It was also noted that wave drag poleward of
30degrees is unable to affect tropical upwelling in a linear model,
so a non-linear thermally driven circulation may be more relevant
(linearity here refers to the anomalies in absolute angular momentum).
Finally, it was noted that air of recent mesospheric origin has been
detected as low as 10hPa at the northern winter pole, implying faster
decent rates than normally expected and suggesting that the entire
mesosphere is stuffed into the polar vortex each winter.

<P>
<B> Pitari</B> and Mancini showed results from a coupled climate model used
to investigate response to volcanic eruptions. It was shown that feedbacks
between the dynamics and the chemistry, associated with an enhanced 
meridional transport circulation, played a significant part in the overall
response (a cooling lasting 3 to 4 years after the eruption).

<P>
<B> Bannister</B>, Gregory, O'Neill and Slingo used a study of transport in
the Met Office Unified Model to investigate the transport of water vapour
into the tropical stratosphere. In DJF it was found that the transport
was greatest where the convection was most active, over the maritime
continent. In JJA, on the other hand, the transport is greatest above
the tropical Pacific, though the convection is displaced over SE Asia
(transport here is measured relative to the 100hPa surface).

<P>
<B> Meleon</B> et al. compared a range of different transport models. The net
fluxes across the tropopause where found to be broadly consistent,
but separating fluxes into upwards and downwards components produced
a wide range of behaviour. Fluxes across the dynamical tropopause,
taken as the 2PVU isosurface,
showed much greater spread than those across the 300hPa surface.

<P>
<B> Langbein</B> and Kouker used N2O and Potential Vorticity fields 
from the Karlsruhe Middle Atmosphere model (KASIMA) to produce a 
climatology of stratospheric streamers. Concentrations of streamers
were found in bands either side of the tropics, at around 10degrees
as well as in the winter surf zone.

<P>
<B> Baldwin</B> used the NCEP 42 year reanalysis to investigate stratosphere
troposphere coupling in the Arctic Oscillation. A composite based on
strong events showed a marked downwards propagating signal, which
persisted in the troposphere for two months after the initial
onset in the stratosphere. Significant changes in storm frequency were
found after stratospheric warmings. It was found that the response at
lower stratospheric levels continued to grow after the forcing, as measured
by the vertical EP flux anomaly, had reversed. This behaviour appears inconsistent
with the suggestion made by <B> Plumb</B> (above) that the lower stratosphere
lags because it responds more slowly.
It was also argued that, contrary to <B> O'Neill's</B> suggestion (above) the
AO is a fundamental mode because it occurs with similar structure in both
north and south and because EOFs of the zonal mean match those of the full
field well, implying that asymmetries do not contribute much.

<P>
<B> Norton</B> et al discussed several aspects of the mean meridional
circulation  in the tropics. In the middle and upper stratosphere
it appears that the resolved waves in the European Centre Reanalyses
cannot account for the momentum fluxes required to satisfy the
transformed Eulerian mean zonal
momentum budget, implying that gravity waves are making a significant
contribution. At lower levels it was pointd out that most
of the mass flux through the tropopause leaves the tropics
in the lower stratosphere where tropospheric wave breaking is
still a significant source of momentum fluxes. It was implied that
that the annual cycle in synoptic wave breaking in the troposphere
is more important in modulating the mass flux through the tropical
tropopause than the breaking of planetary waves in the middle startosphere.

<P>
<B> Riese et al</B> used CRISTA-2 data (which acieves near global 
coverage) to examine transport associated with planetary wave breaking. They
found that the strength of the transport depends on how close
the vortex approaches the sub-tropical transport barrier.

<P>
<B> Juckes</B> showed animations of tropopause potential temperature
and isentropic fields of potential vorticity in the lower stratosphere,
pointing out the greater activity in small scales associated with the
different dynamical structure in the tropopause region, and the
coherence between synoptic structures at the tropopause and 
a wavebreaking event at 450K.

<P>
<B> Montgomery</B> and Brunet described an analytic solution for
sheared Rossby waves on a vortex. The solution portrays bands
of overturning contours separated by bands of enhanced gradients.

<P>
<B> Haigh</B> et al reported form the SOLICE project on the solar influences
of climate. As evidence of possible influences, she showed that
30 hPa geopotential heights are correlated with solar variability.
In order to evaluate the effects of solar variability by means of model
studies, she stressed the importance of taking into account not only
total solar irradiance changes but also variations within spectral
bands, most of the solar variability being confined to the ultraviolet
part of the spectrum. Preliminary results from the SOLICE models
show generally a similar responce to solar changes. 

<P>
<B> Shibata</B> et al. presented results from the Meteorological Research
Institute general circulation model forced by either the ozone observed trend or the solar 11-year cycle. In both cases, the variability associated with the polar night jet appears to be sensitive, although it is difficult to extract statistically significant signals.

<P>
<B> Simon</B>  et al used the climate model ARPEGE coupled to the OPA ocean
model to simulate climate changes from near present to future
(100 year simulation, period 1950-2050, transient IPPC scenario).
The ARPEGE model includes a very simple parameterization of ozone chemistry.
He showed that a non negligible ozone hole is still present in the Antarctic
at the end of the simulation, 2050.

<P>
<B> Halenka</B> intruduced global spherical harmonics as a method to evaluate
long term variability and extra-terrestrial influences on the atmospheric
circulations. He used Free University and NCEP reanalysis data and found that
his analysis seems to suggest a change in the circulation characteristics
occuring during the late seventies. 

<P>
<B> Hartogh</B> et al reported about water vapor profiles (40-85 km) from
measurements at Alomar (Norway), available since 1995. The deduced seasonal
cycle in water vapor shows a fast increase in spring but a slow decrease
in autumn. In the upper stratosphere and mesosphere, the water vapor is
larger in summer than in winter, in agreement with the expectation from
the large scale mass transport. In the upper stratosphere during winter,
high interannual variability is noted.

<P>
<B> Schaeler</B> et al assimilated CHRISTA II water vapor data in the ROSE model (3D chemical transport model). The animation of the assimilated data at 215 hPa revealed sharp bands of water vapor indicative of troposphere - stratosphere exchange. 

<P>
<B> Gray</B>, Dunkerton and Juckes  described an investigation into
the Holton-Tan mechanism using a stratosphere-mesosphere model
run in perpetual January mode with steady zonal wavenumber 1 
forcing at 100hPa. The tropical winds were relaxed to zero except in
a 10km deep band relaxed to -20m/s. The greatest
sensitivity was found when the band was in the upper stratosphere
(40-50km), contrary to the expectation that the lower stratosphere
(20-30km) would have greater impact.

<P>
<B> Shuckburgh</B> and Norton showed statistics relating variations
in the equivalent length (a measure of mixing) to the QBO, ENSO and trends.
The west phase of the QBO was found to be associated with enhanced
mixing in the subtropics and reduced mixing in the tropics.
ENSO was found to be associated with changes in transport at around 350K.
No clear pattern in the trends was identified.

<P>
<B> Hauchecorne</B> and Keckhut described an analysis of trends in the 20 year
record from the lidar of the Observatior&eacute; Haut Provence. 

<P>
<B> Cagnazzo</B> et al have looked for signals of the QBO, solar cycle,
volcanic eruptions and ENSO in monthly mean TOVS data, 1987-95.
The ENSO signal consisted of two cooling regions at 100-70hPa
over the tropical Pacific. The QBO signal was only significant
if the Pinatubo period was excluded from the analysis. The solar cycle has 
an influence, but not statistically reliable because only 3/4 of a
cycle was covered.


<P>
<B> Sato</B> described evidence that there is a gravity wave source in
the southern winter polar stratosphere.
Radiosonde data show evidence of downward propagating waves and 
generation of waves was found in a GCM. In the latter case
the waves were emitted from regions of high curvature with
high local Rossby number.
An MST radar is to be build at Syowa (39E, 69S) and will be able
to answer some of the outstanding questions.


<P>
<B> Th&eacute;odore et al</B> described an algorithm for extracting temperature
information from fluctuations in the signal measured by the GOMOS stellar
occultation instrument on ENVISAT. The time delay between scintillations
was related to refractivity and thence to density and temperature.
Temperature profiles accurate to 1K between 20 and 40km 
at about 300 locations per day were held in prospect.

<P>
<B> Alexander</B> described latitudinal variations in observed gravity wave 
potential energy. There is a peak in the tropics. The width of this
peak is broader than the Kelvin wave structure. It was suggested that this
peak is evidence of low frequency (in the range <i>f</i> to 3<i>f</i>) gravity waves
with periods of about 1day. Evidence of high frequency waves over 
convection was also presented.

<P>
<B> Whiteway</B> et al described measuremens of gravity wave activity in the
tropopause region made with the Egrett aircraft, which can fly up to
15km and measure wind and temperature with a horizontal resolution of
2m. Gravity waves and turbulence associated with their breaking
had been measured. The wave flow was found to obey a minus 3 power
law, and the turbulence an minus 5/3 law.

<P>
<B> Osprey</B> and Lawrence looked at the forcing of mesospheric
planetary waves by gravity waves. They found that tropospheric filtering
of the waves produced a component of forcing 
at stationary zonal wavenumber 1 in the mesosphere.

<P>
<B> Medvedev</B> described a parmetrisation of gravity waves due to
Medvedev and Klaasen. This differs from the Hines scheme in only
allowing waves to doppler shift other waves at smaller scales.
This modification allows the scheme to reproduce the minus 3
saturated spectrum.
Implied diffusion coefficients in the mesosphere where of the
order of 100m2/s, implying that the residual circulation
could no longer be a good measure of transport.
It was argued that the mesopause SAO and the QBO above 80km are driven
by gravity waves. It was also suggested that gravity wave
deceleration of the jet could control the occurence of
polar stratospheric warmings.


<P>
In the poster seesion,
<B> Manzini</B>, Steil and Bruehl described GCM experiments looking at 
the sensitivity of the residual mean circulation to imposed CO2 and SST
changes. It was found that a rise in tropical SST was associated with
and increased residual circulation close to the tropical tropopause.

<P>
<B> Song</B>, Hartogh and Jarchow compared ground based
(MPAE, microwave spectrometer) and space measurements (HALOE) of water vapour. The intercomparison shows that on average the water vapor from the microwave are higher in the stratosphere and lower above. 

<P>
<B> Hampson</B> and Haynes used a mechanistic model to investigate
interannual variability in the QBO. It was found that extratropical
dynamics influences the timing of the phase changes in the QBO.

<P>
<B> De Rudder</B> et al described the 
middle atmosphere resources provided by the
<a href=http://www.badc.rl.ac.uk/data/stratosphere.html>
British Atmospheric Data Centre</a>.
