<h2>2.2 Metre Facility Cleanroom</h2>

<p>The cleanroom accommodates the <a
href="2point2_metre_facility/index.html">2.2 Metre Calibration
Facility</a>, comprising a large thermal vacuum chamber and integral
low vibration support system. The configuration specific to HIRDLS
test and calibration is detailed <a
href="2point2_metre_facility/index.html">here</a>. This section describes the
cleanroom in a more general way and addresses specific design issues
pertinent to the integration, test and calibration of space
instrumentation.</p>

<p>The Class 100 cleanroom was <a
href="building_modifications.html">constructed</a> to include a large
service pit and numerous floors ducts to accommodate both the <a
href="2point2_metre_facility/mass_3.html">seismic mass</a> and the many
services associated with the thermal vacuum chamber.  While this
approach resulted in a well-ordered and uncluttered cleanroom, the
high air leakage rate through the floor tiles necessitated the
provision of a separate, roof-mounted air-conditioning unit to
condition the 0.5 m<sup><small>3</small></sup>/s of make-up air needed
to maintain the cleanroom's overpressure in the range 30 to 40&#160Pa
with a 10&#160Pa differential between the cleanroom and the change
area. The disposition of filters around the test facility is shown
schematically in Fig 1.</p>

<p>Of note is the use of the two in-line carbon filters which
maintain air-borne molecular contamination at low levels. The
materials used in the construction of the cleanroom (paints, sealants,
partitioning etc.) were also selected for both low particle shedding
and low off-gassing and out-gassing. The design drivers for minimising
molecular as well as particulate contamination were the exacting
cleanliness requirements specified for HIRDLS Test and Calibration at
Oxford.</p>

<p>Conditioned and filtered air is supplied to the main body of the cleanroom
by adjustable (volumetric flow rate) HEPA filter/fan units set into the
walls of two walk-in air plenums (Figs 2 and 3). A mobile tunnel structure
placed in front of the auxiliary filter bank (Fig 3) provides a better than
Class 100 clean zone (unidirectional air flow) for equipment storage and
precision assembly work. The provision of a 'clean zone' inside the
cleanroom facilitates multi-tasking (multiple occupancy) without
significantly increasing the risk of particulate contamination (Fig 4). This
arrangement proved highly effective during the integration of the HIRDLS
test and calibration equipment (Fig 5).</p>
