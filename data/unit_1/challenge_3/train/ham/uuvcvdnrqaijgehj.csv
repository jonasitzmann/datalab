AOPP Dobson Room Seminar Facilities
</H2>

<center><img src="g0171076.thm.jpg"></center>

<p>The following are permanently available in the Dobson lecture and
meeting room:

<p><b>Large central projection screen</b>. 

<p><b>Medium-sized projection screen</b> to one side (to the left of
the central screen as seen by the audience).

<p><b>Computer</b> with CD/DVD and floppy drives as well as USB ports
(for memory sticks).  The computer runs Windows XP and is
connected to the internet.  PowerPoint and PDF viewing software is
installed.  Computer output is simultaneously displayed on a VDU for the presenter as well as projected onto the main screen
for the audience.

<p>Alternatively the <b>LCD projector</b> (and VDU display) can be
connected to a laptop.  Mac users please bring a Mac to VGA
connector. The resolution of the projector is 480 x 640 - this
occasionally causes problems with laptops that are set to output at a
higher resolution.  Please know how to adjust the output resolution of
your laptop if you intend to use it as the source of your
presentation.  If required the laptop could be connected into the
internet (either wirelessly of through an Ethernet link) for a
presentation.  Please let us know in advance if this is required.

<p><b>High intensity (metal halide) overhead projector</b> for central
screen; this takes a minute to switch on and should not be switched
off for less than 15 minutes (cover the glass if you want to show
slides).
 
<p><b>Standard overhead projector</b> for side screen. 

<p><b>Slide projector</b> plus a spare directed at the central screen;
remotely controlled by the speaker or can be controlled from next to
the projector.

<p><b>Video player with two 27 inch television displays</b> on either
side of room (not equipped to receive television broadcasts).

<p><b>Television modulator</b>, when enables output from PCs or Macs to
be displayed on the televisions at low resolution.

<p><b>Blackboard</b> of which about 0.8 m<sup>2</sup> is visible the
whole time; the remainder (about 2.9 m<sup>2</sup>) is behind the two
screens, which can be rolled up.

<p><b>White board</b> of which about 2 m<sup>2</sup> is visible the
whole time; the remainder (about 2.5 m<sup>2</sup>) is behind the main
screens, which can be rolled up.


<p><b>Lights</b> - when using the projectors the front row of
lights should be left off, and the rest on. When using the blackboard,
all of the lights need to be on.



<p>We do NOT have an audio tape player or cine film projector
(although the last item could possibly be borrowed given a few days
notice).

<P>
