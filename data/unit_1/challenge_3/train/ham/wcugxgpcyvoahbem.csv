The RSGS has an extensive collection of over 15,000 maps, many of which were acquired as a result of the Society's long association with the map-making firm of John Bartholomew and Sons. &nbsp; The material is currently in the process of being catalogued and sorted in accordance with the Ministry of Defence classification scheme. &nbsp; The most valuable of the Society's antique maps are temporarily stored for safe keeping in the <a href="http://www.nls.ac.uk/aboutnls/about_pic3.htm">Map Library</a> of the <a href="http://www.nls.ac.uk/">National Library of Scotland</a>, where they may be consulted with prior permission from the RSGS, but many historical maps are still retained by the Society itself.

The collection covers all areas of the Earth (and indeed some other parts of the Solar System), but is, of course, particularly strong in its coverage of Scotland. &nbsp; In this area we have large collections of early Ordnance Survey 6-inch and 1-inch series, plus a few sheets at the larger scales, in addition to the more modern series. &nbsp; The Society receives by regular donation all new and revised Admiralty charts, and this material forms a large and constantly growing part of the collection. &nbsp; RAF and AAF aeronautical charts of the world at 1:1,000,000 and 1:500,000 scales give additional coverage of all land and sea areas. &nbsp; Of special interest within the collection are the maps dating from the period covering the two World Wars, including detailed plans of many mainland European towns and villages. &nbsp; A special map-chest houses the cartographic materials of Professor Terry Coppock (Ogilvie Professor of Geography at the University of Edinburgh), who kindly donated his personal teaching and research collections to the Society in 1998.

A wide variety of formats is to be found in the collection. &nbsp; In addition to the standard map sheets (stored flat in chests of drawers), we also have many folded maps, wall charts, and atlases. &nbsp; There are also many reproductions of maps in our <a href="photocol.htm">slide collections</a> (both lantern and 35mm), and a few digital examples on CD-ROM. &nbsp; Additionally, we maintain a collection of guide-books covering many parts of the world, and a small number of other reference materials and books about maps and map-making.

A planvariograph enables tracing to be carried-out at adjustable scaling factors, and a microcomputer is provided to facilitate access to the database of catalogue records.
</p>
<p align=justify>
The RSGS does not have a current budget for the purchase of maps, so for the development of the collection we are dependent on the generosity of donors. &nbsp; Potential donors should contact the <a href="OfficeBe/director.htm">Director</a> in the first instance.
</p>
<p align=justify>
Maps may be consulted by prior arrangement with the <a href="http://personal.strath.ac.uk/kerr.jamieson/">Curator</a>, and it may be possible in some cases for reproductions (within the terms of the current copyright legislation) to be made at the client's expense. &nbsp; Only in exceptional circumstances may maps be borrowed, entirely at the discretion of the <a href="OfficeBe/director.htm">Director</a>.
