Abstract:
</H4>

<p>
The Met Office's Unified Model is able to reproduce the climate of the 
present day with high accuracy. But how well does it represent climates 
outside this regime? Specifically the hypothesised Neoproterozoic 
`Snowball Earth' climate will be investigated, and what modelling
can tell us about the climate at that time.
