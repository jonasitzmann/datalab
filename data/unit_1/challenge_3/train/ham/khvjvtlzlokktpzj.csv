<h2>Electronics Services Workshop</h2>

<p>The department supports a small, but well equipped, 'on-site'
electronics workshop, with additional resources available 'off-site'
from a <a href="http://www.physics.ox.ac.uk/electronics/">central
physics electronics workshop</a> and <a
href="http://www.physics.ox.ac.uk/electronics/pfu/pfu-web-page-dr-weave-htm.htm">photolithography
facility</a>. The 'on-site' workshop staff (Fig&#160;1) are unique in
having acquired more than 20 years experience through their
involvement with the following earth observation and planetary
experiments: ISAMS (on UARS), ATSR1/2 (on ERS1/2), PMIRR1 (on Mars
Observer), PMIRR2 (on Mars Climate Orbiter) EOR (on EURECA) MOPITT (on
Terra), CIRS (on Cassini), and HIRDLS (on Aura).</p>

<p>At the component-level of assembly, quality assurance (QA) is
provided by recognised training courses: at the Jet Propulsion
Laboratory in 1990 (applicable NASA Handbooks NHB5300.4(3A-2) and
NHB5300.4(3L)), and more recently in 1999 at the <a
href="http://www.highbury.ac.uk/pdf/ESA/ESA2.pdf">ESA authorised
training centre (UK)</a> at <a
href="http://www.highbury.ac.uk/business/esa.html">Highbury
College</a>, Portsmouth (applicable ESA Specifications, PSS-01-708 and
PSS-01-738). In compliance with the quality assurance requirements for
space flight electronics, finished assemblies may also undergo
environmental testing 'on-site' using the department's <a
href="vibration_testing.html">vibration test facility</a> or in one of
its many thermal vacuum chambers, such as the newly installed <a
href="thermal_cycling_chamber.html">thermal cycling chamber</a>.</p> <TABLE WIDTH=100%

<p>An example of a recently delivered electronics subsystem is the HIRDLS
Blackbody Electronics Unit (BEU) shown partly assembled in Fig&#160;2 and
Fig&#160;3. The BEU, the <a
href="../capabilities/blackbodies.html">In-flight
Calibration Blackbody (IFCBB)</a> and the interconnecting harness
comprise the instrument's in-flight calibration subsystem. The
electronics design was a joint development between Oxford University
and <a href="http://www.brightwell-instruments.co.uk">Brightwell
Instruments Ltd.</a>, while manufacture, assembly and test was carried
out at Oxford. The workshop staff are also skilled in the assembly of
precision mechanical parts and mechanisms, closely support the
integration and re-configuring of the department's test and
calibration facilities and manufacture and terminate the cryogenic
harnesses used in <a
href="../capabilities/fpa.html">focal plane
arrays</a>.  Lightweight enclosures for flight electronics may now be
manufactured 'on-site' using design and finite element analysis
software and the machine tools available in the <a
href="mechanical.html">mechanical workshop</a>.</p>
