        <h1>Support Services</h1>
		<h3>Aims</h3>
		<p>In the spirit of the University's mission to place the 'student at the centre', Student Services aims to provide high quality professional, non-judgemental and impartial counselling, advice, assistance and information on a broad range of issues for current and prospective students. The department aims to offer up-to-date and unbiased information in an accessible format. The services the department offers are available to all who need it regardless of racial origin, gender, sexuality, nationality, disability, and age or cultural/religious beliefs.</p>
		<h3><img src="images/clearing2.JPG" width="250" height="167" hspace="2" border="1" align="left" />Confidentiality</h3>
		<p>Each service within Student Services has its own confidentiality statement.  In general, no information about any individual student will be disclosed to any person who could identify that student, without his or her express permission. Only in exceptional circumstances, where the student is deemed to be a danger to themselves, others or if there is a legal duty, may this confidentiality be broken. With your full knowledge a confidential record of your enquiry will be kept, as well as the advice and action taken. Upon request, students shall have access to their case notes in the presence of a member of the relevant service.</p>
		<h3><img src="images/clearing3.JPG" width="250" height="167" hspace="2" border="1" align="left" />Monitoring and Evaluation</h3>
		<p>In order to provide pro-active and high quality services, it is important that we (with your assistance) collate statistics on the types of enquiry we receive and the types of student making enquiries. From time to time, Student Services also sends out questionnaires to students who have used its services to evaluate their effectiveness. The monitoring and evaluation figures are used in such a way that it is not possible for them to be associated with individual cases, which would breach confidentiality. We monitor and evaluate to help us provide genuinely user-led services in line with Abertay's mission to place the 'student at the centre'.</p>
		<h3><img src="images/clearing1_000.JPG" width="250" height="166" hspace="2" border="1" align="left" />Complaints</h3>			
  <p>If any student has a complaint about the service s/he has received s/he should do so in writing to the Head of Student Services, in the first instance. Should this fail to resolve matters, you have the right to use the University's student complaints procedure. 
		<br/><br/>
  </p>
		<p>International students can also complain to the Office of the Immigration Services Commissioner on matters relating to immigration advice. A copy of the complaint scheme is held by the Head of Student Services or can be found at  <a href="http://www.oisc.org.uk/" title="http://www.oisc.org.uk/" target="_blank">http://www.oisc.org.uk/</a>.</p>
