<a name="intro"><h3>Introduction</h3></a>

<P>The Department develops and builds
space instruments to study the atmospheres of the Earth and the
planets of the Solar System.  Data analysis for experiments already in
space involves sophisticated radiative transfer and information
retrieval theory, and applications aimed at an improved understanding
of global dynamics, composition and energy balance and their
evolution.  Theoretical and modelling groups in the areas of middle
atmosphere dynamics, physical oceanography, nonlinear processes and
geophysical and planetary fluid dynamics study fundamental atmospheric
processes, and carry out laboratory experiments on rotating fluids.
The overall goals are to understand how atmospheres function, as
physical systems; to understand their origin and evolution; and to
seek physics-based solutions to problems of the global environment
such as ozone depletion, greenhouse warming, and climate change.</P>



<a name="earth"><h3>Earth Observation</h3></a>

<P>The <I>Improved Stratospheric and Mesospheric Sounder </I>(ISAMS)
data analysis project moved into a much less active phase with the
ending of NERC support this year.  During the 3 year life of the grant
ending this year, 38 refereed papers and 4 doctoral theses have been
produced.</P>

<P>The operational ISAMS data processing suite has been upgraded to a
high level, the whole data set has been processed at the UARS Central
Data Handling Facility and has been placed in public archives at the
Distributed Active Archive Center at the Goddard Space Flight Center
and at the British Atmospheric Data Centre.  We reported last year
that version 10 of the data has been subject to careful and detailed
validation, and the resulting documents published in the open
literature.  A further processing, version 12, has been carried out
this year improved in many ways, and is available but not fully
validated.  Improvements include new spectroscopic data, nine new
aerosol products for all nine wavelengths measured, and improved
nitric acid (HNO<FONT SIZE=2>3) abundances using a joint
retrieval with aerosol.  The nitric oxide (NO) retrieval now allows
for breakdown of local thermodynamic equilibrium (non-LTE) and aerosol
contamination, and daytime NO data is catalogued the first time.  The
carbon monoxide (CO) retrieval now uses an in-line calculation of the
non-LTE source function, and a better dinitrogen pentoxide, N<FONT
SIZE=2>2O<FONT SIZE=2>5, retrieval using improved
aerosol and minor contaminants corrections.</P>

<P>A wide range of scientific studies have been carried out, both
within the Oxford group and collaboratively with other researchers
world-wide.  In addition the data set has been used in conjunction
with other UARS data by many other researchers, and will continue to
be an important resource for the future.</P>

<P>The most significant results from the ISAMS instrument are
undoubtedly those related to volcanic aerosol, polar stratospheric
clouds and the heterogeneous chemistry involved in ozone depletion.
ISAMS was not designed for this purpose, as it was not an important
topic at the time - that this valuable information could be obtained
is a credit to the research assistants involved.  As a result of data
from ISAMS and other UARS instruments, the community is now converging
on a much clearer understanding of the processes that control ozone
and have caused its depletion in recent years.</P>

<P>Some work on ISAMS data will continue with the awarding of a
contract under Framework 4 for a multi-instrument investigation of
polar stratospheric cloud formation and the heterogeneous chemistry
involved in stratospheric ozone depletion.  This work will be carried
out by an international consortium co-ordinated by Oxford. Also, Drs
P.E. Morris and R.G. Grainger of the ISAMS team were awarded Natural
Environment Research Council Earth Observation Science Initiative
Fellowships to continue composition and aerosol work.</P>

<P>Involvement with the European Space Agency's <I>Michelson Interferometer for Passive Atmospheric Sounding</I> project (MIPAS) has expanded over the year.  We have provided a reference radiative transfer model against which the operational models will be validated, and have investigated improved, faster, methods for radiative transfer calculations required for data retrieval.  Like ISAMS, MIPAS is designed to measure the concentration profiles of atmospheric constituents on a global scale.  It will observe the atmospheric emissions from the Earth's horizon (limb) throughout the mid-infrared region (4-16 micron), which will allow the simultaneous measurement of more than 20 trace gases, including the complete family of nitrogen-oxygen compounds, water vapour and ozone.  Our involvement is primarily to:</P>

<P>(1) Investigate the physical and numerical problems that are of
critical importance to the design of a representative radiative
transfer model for the MIPAS instrument, including issues such as
non-LTE, instrument apodisation, finite field-of-view effects, and
line-shape modelling.</P>

<P>(2) Generate a state-of-the-art radiation forward model
incorporating the physics outlined in (1).  Perform a detailed
validation of the new algorithm against existing models and
experimental results, where available.</P>

<P>(3) Use the forward model to verify the performance of the central
ESA/MIPAS processing software.  The MIPAS processing software forms
part of the ENVISAT Payload Data Segment (PDS) which will be developed
by Thomson-CSF.</P>

<P>Dr Guillermo Zaragoza from the Institute of Astrophysics, Granada,
Spain has been visiting the department this year, working on non-LTE
thermal emissions from mesospheric constituents, in particular to
obtain CO<FONT SIZE=2>2 concentration in the mesosphere from ISAMS
radiances, but also examining the behaviour of methane, water and
hydroxyl.</P>

<P>Two research students are approaching the end of their work using
ISAMS data, Jane Attwell has instigated heterogeneous reactions on
volcanic aerosol and has been able to improve our knowledge of some of
the reaction rates involved.  Katerina Koutoulaki has studied
non-thermal emissions from ozone in the mesosphere, and has been able
to interpret the radiances measured by ISAMS in terms of a model of
the vibrational excitation of ozone upon its formation.</P>

<a name="hirdls"><h3>High Resolution Dynamics Limb Sounder (HIRDLS) </h3></a>

<P>The Department is collaborating with other groups in the UK and USA
to build the HIRDLS remote sounding satellite instrument to be
launched on the Chem-1 satellite in 2002.  Chem-1 is part of NASA's
Earth Observing System suite of satellites, and HIRDLS will measure
the concentration of trace species, temperature and pressure
variations in the Earth's atmosphere between about 8 and 100 km
altitude at a much finer spatial scale than previous instruments, to
about 1 km vertical resolution and 500 km horizontally.  Oxford is
taking the scientific and technical lead in the UK, with the
Rutherford Appleton Laboratory, Reading University, Matra Marconi
Space and GEC-Marconi playing major roles.  Primary financial support
is from the Natural Environment Research Council.  The University of
Colorado is taking the lead in the USA, working with the National
Center for Atmospheric Research, the University of Washington and
several aerospace companies.  </P>

<P>Oxford is also building part of the hardware, namely the in-flight
radiometric calibration target and electronics, the instrument
gyroscope electronics, and the electrical and thermal ground support
equipment.  The instrument will be calibrated at Oxford before launch,
and to this end we are currently building a calibration laboratory
plus test equipment.  In addition the Department is to undertake a
number of software tasks concerned with flight operations and data
processing, although these have yet to get underway.  </P>

<P>The Project started in 1988, and major funding began in 1991.  The
design is now nearly final in most areas after several years of
iteration, in conjunction with our collaborators, and detailed and
extensive modelling of individual items.  A prototype of the in-flight
calibration target has been built during the last year, and work has
started in constructing the gyro electronics.  The electrical ground
support equipment is very advanced, with a large part of the software
having been written.  Building of the calibration facility began in
spring 1997.  The complex floor structure has now been completed, and
clean room installation is about to start.  Since the instrument has
unusually stringent pointing requirements (better than an arc second),
a very stable calibration environment is necessary.  To achieve this,
a 10 ton steel and high strength concrete seismic mass has been
manufactured to our design.  This will be mounted within the floor on
pneumatic springs to isolate the instrument and test equipment from
vibrational disturbances.  A 5 m long 2.3 m diameter aluminium vacuum
chamber has been manufactured to our design.  It will be mounted on
the floor above the seismic mass with an optical bench inside the
chamber supported on the mass via columns passing through flexible
diaphragms in the chamber wall.  Design of the calibration equipment
to be mounted in the chamber has begun, and an innovative design has
been developed for the large radiometric targets that are also
required.  A major effort has been put into the calibration of
temperature sensors, since they govern our knowledge of radiometric
emission from both the on-board and the ground calibration targets,
and hence directly affect the instrument measurement accuracy.  The
aim is to measure to 30 mK absolute, during the 5 years in orbit, and
it currently appears that this will be achieved.  This builds on work
which we undertook for the calibration of the Along-Track Scanning
Radiometer (ATSR) instruments where comparable accuracies were
obtained. </P>

<a name="climate"><h3>Detection of Climate Change</h3></a>

<P>The sub-Department is also involved in objective methods of
quantifying uncertainty in the detection, attribution and prediction
of climate change.  This work involves close collaboration with the
Rutherford Appleton Laboratory, the climate change modelling and
detection group at the Hadley Centre of the UK Meteorological Office,
the Max Planck Institute for Meteorology in Hamburg, the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology and the University's Departments of Statistics
and Mathematics.  We use a combination of statistical analysis and
inverse modelling techniques to compare climate model simulations with
recent decadal-timescale changes in variables such as surface and
atmospheric temperatures.  Focusing initially on detecting the
"fingerprint" of anthropogenic climate change, we are working towards
observationally-based estimates of uncertainty in predictions of
future climate.  A key aspect of this work involves analysis and
validation of model simulations of internal climate variability, which
plays a key role in any uncertainty analysis.</P>

<P>Also through collaboration with RAL, the department is involved in
scientific applications of the Along-Track Scanning Radiometers, a
series of satellite instruments designed to monitor sea-surface
temperature, but also providing information on clouds and atmospheric
aerosols.  The department was heavily involved in the design and
calibration of the ATSR instruments.  Ongoing projects include the
synthesis of ATSR SSTs and altimetric sea-surface height data using
dynamical models of the near-surface ocean (in collaboration with the
Southampton Oceanography Centre) and the study of ice and water cloud
parameters with ATSR.</P>



<a name="urban"><h3>Urban Air Pollution Monitoring</h3></a>

<P>The department is currently developing an experiment using a
low-cost, portable, infrared interferometer (FTIR) to be operated in
an urban environment to make high-sensitivity measurements of nitrogen
oxide, carbon-monoxide, sulphur dioxide, from a range of pollution
sources, including motor vehicles.  Similar FTIR instruments have been
used by investigators in the USA to make multi-gas fugitive emission
measurements from factories and refineries.  Our intention is to
combine recent advances in FTIR design with improved atmospheric
retrieval and radiative transfer techniques.  The main advantages of
the FTIR approach relative to direct sampling methods are: (1)
simultaneous measurements of a wide range of gases; (2) remote
measurements of highly reactive gases; (2) remote measurements of
highly reactive gases; (3) the study of short time scale urban
pollution chemistry; (4) the ability to provide spatial averages over
extended regions; (5) low running costs and simple calibration.  The
instrument will initially be operated in the centre of Oxford, to
investigate the influence of motor traffic on local air quality. </P>

<a name="plan"><h3>Planetary Experiments</h3></a>

<P>The Cassini Saturn orbiter was launched from Cape Canaveral on 15th
October 1997 carrying the Composite Infra-Red Spectrometer (CIRS)
experiment, developed in part in this department.  The Oxford-built
part of this US-French-British instrument is a custom-designed cooler
and associated cryogenic system which maintains the detector arrays at
liquid nitrogen temperature using a passive radiator.  During the past
year the cooler was returned to Oxford for complete refurbishment then
reinstalled on the instrument which was subsequently recalibrated.
The CIRS investigation will focus on determining the composition and
thermal structure of the atmospheres of Saturn and Titan.  Titan,
Saturn's largest moon, is particularly interesting because in many
respects its atmosphere resembles that of the Earth.  In particular
Titan has a surface pressure slightly higher than Earth's and the same
major atmospheric constituent, nitrogen.  Cassini will not arrive
until 2004 and during the long cruise the Oxford team will concentrate
on planning observations for the four year mission in orbit around
Saturn as well as developing models of the photochemistry and
radiative transfer in both atmospheres.</P>

<P>This year we have competed deliveries of flight hardware for the
replacement PMIRR (Pressure Modulator Infra-Red Radiometer) experiment
to investigate the present-day climate of the planet Mars.  The
original instrument was lost on Mars Observer in 1993, but the new
model will be launched on Mars Surveyor in December 1998.  AOPP
supplied the detectors, transmitting optics and pressure modulators
for both instruments which were built in collaboration with the NASA
Jet Propulsion Laboratory and, for the new instrument, colleagues in
Russia.  Calibration is now complete and the instrument has been
installed on the spacecraft.  PMIRR will orbit Mars for a full Martian
year producing three dimensional maps of atmospheric temperature,
water and dust content which will allow us to study the seasonal
cycles of Martian water and the dynamics of the atmosphere.</P>

<a name="data"><h3>Planetary Data Analysis</h3></a>

<P>After its launch in 1989, and a six year interplanetary cruise, the
Galileo spacecraft arrived at its final destination, Jupiter, on
December 7th, 1995.  After deploying a separate entry probe, the main
spacecraft went into a highly elliptical orbit about the planet.  AOPP
is part of the international team which provided the Near Infrared
Mapping Spectrometer (NIMS) on board the orbiter which measures of the
infrared spectrum from 0.7 - 5.2 &#181;m.  The data from the probe
have provided the first ever in situ measurements of the conditions in
the Jovian atmosphere and have given a tantalising glimpse of a single
region of that planet.  The department is continuing to play a key
role in the analysis of the NIMS data, which began to arrive in June
1996, using advanced radiative transfer code which is able to simulate
the complex, scattering processes in that cloudy atmosphere.  This
model, combined with optimal estimation retrieval code also developed
at Oxford, has provided new estimates of cloud heights and properties
together with the abundances of gases such as water vapour and
ammonia.  To assist in this analysis, we have conducted a programme
for many years to measure the spectral characteristics of Jovian gases
in the laboratory, using the long-path facility at Rutherford Appleton
Laboratory, and a new study has just been completed investigating the
transmission of methane at the low temperatures found in the Jovian
atmosphere.  The analysis of NIMS measurements of Jupiter is by no
means complete and will continue to provide the core of the group's
work for at least the next year.  However, new projects are rapidly
approaching with which we will shortly be having a major involvement.
The most pressing of these will be to analyse the measurements of the
Martian atmosphere made by the Pressure Modulator Infrared Radiometer
(PMIRR), described above.  The rebuilt PMIRR will be launched on Mars
Global Surveyor '98 in December 1998 and will begin measurements at
the end of 1999.  We are planning to play a central role in the
operational retrieval of temperature, pressure, water vapour and dust
profiles from these measurements and are currently updating the
retrieval suites developed for the first PMIRR.  In addition to the
major projects outlined above, we are also involved, to a lesser
extent in a number of other missions.  Oxford is part of an
international team (with other members at University of London, and
the University of Saskatchewan in Canada) analysing the infrared
spectra of Saturn and Titan measured by the Infrared Space Observatory
(ISO).  Simulations of the infrared spectrum of Titan, the largest of
Saturn's moons and a key target of the forthcoming Cassini mission,
are being conducted to assist in the mission planning of that project
and also to compare to recent observations by ground-based telescopes
and by ISO. </P>

<a name="ad"><h3>Atmospheric Dynamics</h3></a>

<P>We use a variety of numerical dynamical models to interpret
satellite and other data.  Our main focus is on the Earth's
stratosphere and mesosphere, but we are also broadening our scope to
include some tropospheric phenomena as well.</P>

<P>We have been studying travelling planetary waves in the middle
atmosphere.  Some of these waves are thought to be initiated by
instabilities of the mean flow.  To study this possibility, an
instability analysis has been performed, using the primitive equations
linearized about a zonal-mean state.  The flow is perturbed and an
eigenvalue calculations give us the fastest growing mode.  So far a
one-dimensional code has been tested, and a two-dimensional version is
currently being developed.</P>

<P>We have continued to use the linear tidal model of Wood and Andrews
(1997) to simulate diurnal and semidiurnal tides in the middle
atmosphere.  Comparisons have been made with tidal simulations made
using the (nonlinear) Universities' Global Atmospheric Modelling
Programme (UGAMP) Extended General Circulation Model.  Some structural
similarities are apparent between the linear and nonlinear model
simulations of the diurnal tide, but none are obvious for the
semidiurnal tide. This may be because of differences in the thermal
forcing between the models.  The forcing mechanisms in the models are
therefore being adapted to conform more strictly with each other.
Comparisons with observational data are planned.  A long-term aim is
to study the extent to which linear approximations can be used in
tidal simulations.</P>

<P>We have been investigating the influence of extratropical
stratospheric warmings on tropical dynamics and transport in the
middle atmosphere.  Several stratospheric warmings are simulated in
perpetual January runs of the UK Meteorological Office's
Stratosphere-Mesosphere Model, and the model shows that diabatic
ascent, inertial instability and barotropic instability are all
enhanced at low latitudes during these warmings.  The effect on
equatorial material transport is being investigated using the SLIMCAT
chemical and transport model.</P>

<P>We have also been forcing equatorially-confined waves in a version
of the UK Meteorological Office's Stratosphere-Mesosphere Model.
These waves drive mean-flow accelerations in the zonal wind over the
equator and, under the right conditions, can create an oscillation
resembling the observed equatorial quasi-biennial oscillation (QBO).
The model at present is being modified in several areas.  The vertical
resolution is being increased from 1 km to 500m and a more realistic
background state is being introduced.  It is hoped that a realistic
quasi-biennial oscillation can be forced in the model and the
variability in this QBO will be investigated.</P>

<P>We have begun a study of climate variability associated with
changes in tropical and extratropical sea-surface temperatures, using
the UK Meteorological Office's Unified Model.</P>

<a name="gpfd"><h3>Geophysical and Planetary Fluid Dynamics</h3></a>

<P>The Geophysical and Planetary Fluid Dynamics group carries out
research on dynamical processes in planetary atmospheres and oceans
via laboratory experiments on various analogues of atmospheric system
and a range of types of numerical model, including large-scale general
circulation models (GCMs).  Staff changes have included the departures
of Drs Frueh and Collins to take up posts respectively as Lecturer in
the Dept. of Mechanical and Chemical Engineering at Heriot-Watt
University and on the research staff of the Hadley Centre for Climate
Prediction and Research. </P>

<P>The planetary work of the group has continued to be centred around
the development and exploitation of a set of advanced general
circulation models (GCMs) of Mars, in collaboration with the
Laboratoire de M&eacute;t&eacute;orologie Dynamique (LMD) du CNRS, now
at the Universit&eacute; Pierre et Marie Curie in Paris, with support
from the Particle Physics and Astronomy Research Council and the
European Space Agency.  A programme of climate simulations for Mars
using the new LMD and Oxford Mars GCMs was completed and used to
compile a new climate database of Mars.  This has been developed
initially for use by spacecraft engineers and mission scientists for
planning future missions to Mars (such as the newly proposed Mars
Express mission by ESA), and includes a range of advanced features
including an advanced and novel model to simulate patterns of
correlated variability to enable the construction of realistic
profiles of principal atmospheric variables of interest to engineers
(such as density and wind shear) along specified entry trajectories to
be followed by a spacecraft.  The variability model is based partly on
an empirical orthogonal function analysis of actual large-scale
variability in the GCM simulations, together with a representation of
small-scale processes such as gravity waves, which are added to the
climatologically-averaged fields to produce realistic realisations of
instantaneous atmospheric structure such as might be encountered by a
spacecraft lander during its descent to the Martian surface. </P>

<P>The database contains detailed information on the atmospheric
structure of Mars and its variability, including both seasonal and
diurnal variations, at a spectral resolution of T31, equivalent to a
grid resolution of around 200 km, with 20 vertical levels on a
terrain-following co-ordinate system over a range in altitude from 5m
to 80-100 km, covering three main regimes of dust opacity as observed
on Mars.  As such, therefore, it is also of considerable interest to
the science community, as well as for engineers, and access has now
been made available over the World-Wide Web (at
http://www.lmd.jussieu.fr/mars.html), and an atlas of statistics is in
preparation.  Although spacecraft data from the Mariner and Viking
missions had been used to validate various elements of the GCM during
its development, an opportunity to carry out a new test of its
validity occurred during the year with the successful landing of the
NASA Mars Pathfinder spacecraft in July.  Preliminary comparisons of
statistics from the database with the Pathfinder entry profile and
surface measurements of temperature, pressure and wind over several
weeks of the mission show generally good agreement, especially with
the variation of near-surface temperatures at the location of the
Pathfinder landing site.</P>

<P>Our programme of development and validation of a meteorological
data assimilation scheme for the Martian atmosphere has continued to
make excellent progress with the implementation of a new version to
assimilate remotely-sensed and <I>in situ </I> observations directly
into the latest version of our comprehensive Mars GCM (as used also
for the climate database).  A range of test assimilations have been
carried out using data derived from simulations using the NASA Ames
Mars GCM, obtained under very different conditions from those assumed
in the initial assimilation.  These tests have further demonstrated
the capability of the scheme to achieve accurate reconstructions of
the original atmospheric state and evolution under quite realistic
conditions, given a sufficient density of observations of temperature
and surface pressure.  The first major application of this approach is
anticipated shortly in the analysis of new observations of Mars to be
obtained from the Mars Global Surveyor mission, now in orbit around
Mars.</P>

<P>Work has continued in collaboration with Dr I.M. Moroz of the
Mathematics Institute at Oxford to use Empirical Orthogonal Function
(EOF) methods to analyse the results of GCM simulations of the Martian
atmospheric circulation and to obtain reduced dimensional dynamical
models of large-scale phenomena in Mars' atmosphere.  Results obtained
so far have shown the potential value of the EOF method in efficiently
capturing the dominant dynamical modes in both simplified and
comprehensive models of Mars' atmospheric circulation using as few as
10-20 components.  This indicates the likely feasibility of obtaining
reasonably low-order dynamical models in the next phase of the
project. </P>

<P>With the continuing success of the Galileo mission at Jupiter, our
programme of dynamical modelling of the Jovian atmosphere has
continued with the development of a fully time-dependent dynamical
model of Jupiter's stratosphere and upper troposphere.  This has been
adapted from a version of the Unified Model for the Earth's atmosphere
originally developed by the UK Meteorological Office as the basis for
its weather and climate prediction models.  To date, a prototype model
has been implemented to simulate the fully three-dimensional
circulation of Jupiter's stratosphere and troposphere over the
pressure range from 10 bars (~100 km below the visible cloud tops) to
around 10 mb.  The model covers a limited range in longitude and
latitude (e.g. from 0- 35S in latitude and 90in longitude) in order to
achieve a reasonable spatial resolution (1-2in both latitude and
longitude), and has been run with up to 30 levels in the vertical.
Parametrizations of physical processes are so far fairly crude, based
on simple Newtonian relaxation to a specified thermal structure
(designed to reflect the known structure derived from observations
obtained by Voyager and the Galileo orbiter and probe) and a specified
pattern of zonal velocity at 10 bars.  Preliminary results have shown
the development of intriguing patterns of eddies and vortices, with
complex mixed baroclinic-barotropic vertical structures and on scales
comparable with the observed White Ovals. </P>

<P>Laboratory studies form an important element of the research
programme in geophysical fluid dynamics, enabling the investigation of
a wide range of dynamical instabilities and other processes through
means which are highly complementary to more conventional modelling
studies in dynamical meteorology and oceanography.  Such studies are
also a rich training ground for research students, of whom three have
been actively involved in our programme this year. </P>

<P>A study of nonlinear barotropic instability made good progress, using apparatus to generate a detached barotropic shear layer in a rotating homogenous fluid.  The flow was observed to generate sequences of eddies through barotropic instability, and laser-Doppler measurements of radial velocity have shown that the flow exhibits a rich bifurcation structure as experimental parameters are varied, including period-doubling cascades and intriguing regions of parameter space where the flow breaks down discontinuously into fully three-dimensional turbulent motion.  Work has progressed during the year to develop a means to investigate the spatial structure of these flows using particle-tracking methods.  A new set of light sources have been constructed and installed to illuminate neutrally-buoyant opaque white tracer particles in the flow, and have so far clearly demonstrated the vertical coherence of patterns of motion with depth. </P>

<P>A programme of experiments to investigate baroclinic instabilities
in a two-layer stratified rotating annulus has also been completed,
using some novel methods of flow visualisation and analysis which
exploit the wavelength-dependent properties of optical activity in one
of the fluid layers.  By illuminating the flow from below with a
diffuse white-light source and viewing the system from above between
crossed polaroids, dynamically-induced variations in the height of the
interface appear as changes in the colour transmitted.  This technique
has proved invaluable in revealing an unprecedented wealth of detail
within the two-layer baroclinic flows, including the discovery of
complex multi-mode interactions and slow chaotic variability in a
regime which clearly parallels similar behaviour found in some of our
earlier experiments in a continuously-stratified fluid with
differential heating.  This is a significant result, since it confirms
the hypothesis that nonlinear modal interactions between small
ensembles of baroclinic waves are a generic means for a rotating,
stratified fluid to generate chaotic (though roughly cyclic)
variability on very long timescales.  Another novel flow regime has
been investigated at low bulk Richardson number in which
time-dependent large-scale (zonal wavenumber m=2) baroclinic waves
were observed to generate trains of short wavelength inertia-gravity
waves (with local wavelength equivalent to m ~ 25) in regions of
locally strong shear.  This appears to represent the radiation of
inertia-gravity waves in connection with the geostrophic adjustment
process, and is considerable topical interest in the context of the
use of geostrophically balanced models as the basis for the
formulation of atmospheric models and data assimilation methods.
Analyses of the time-dependence of the large-scale flow in this regime
indicates that its behaviour does not depend on that of the
inertia-gravity waves, but is consistent with the existence of a fuzzy
'slow quasi-manifold'. </P>

<P>Experiments with a thermally-driven rotating annulus have continued
with the completion of a new upgrade of a rig to make high resolution
measurements of velocity fields using particle-tracking methods.  The
newly upgraded system includes automation of the control of all main
experimental parameters (boundary temperatures and rotation rate),
tracer particle illumination and data acquisition (for measurements of
temperature and rotation rate).  Following completion of this upgrade,
a new programme of experiments was started to investigate nonlinear
mechanisms for slow variability in baroclinic flow in the presence of
zonally-periodic bottom topography. </P>

<P>Two projects making use of numerical models to simulate flows in
the laboratory have also made good progress.  A version of the MIT
ocean model was adapted to simulate flow in the thermal annulus in the
presence of bottom topography, and some encouraging preliminary
results have been obtained for comparison with the experiments
outlined above. In another project, a finite-difference Navier-Stokes
originally developed at the UK Meteorological Office for simulation of
flow in the rotating annulus was adapted to employ alternative
representations of advection, including in particular a form of the
semi-Lagrangian scheme under development for the Met. Office Unified
Model.  A major objective of this study is to make close quantitative
comparisons of simulations made using various schemes with accurate
laboratory measurements, in order to evaluate the performance of the
numerical techniques. Results so far have concentrated on simulation
of axisymmetric flows, and indicate that both Eulerian and
semi-Lagrangian models converge towards close agreement (to within
2-3%) in their heat transport and kinetic energy with laboratory
measurements at very high resolution.  At intermediate resolutions,
however, significant systematic errors were found which are comparable
in magnitude to known 'climate drifts' in atmospheric models, though
of a different character between differing advection schemes and grid
arrangements. </P>

<P>A number of theoretical studies associated with our laboratory
programme have also continued during the year, several in
collaboration with colleagues at the Mathematics Institute in Oxford.
Good progress has also been made in developing methods to obtain
optimal low-dimensional models of baroclinic wave regimes from
measured time series in the laboratory, via EOF-Galerkin techniques.
These studies aim to investigate the dynamics especially of the
complex multi-mode baroclinic wave regimes mentioned above, and are
highly complementary to the EOF-Galerkin studies of the circulation of
the Martian atmosphere within the group. </P>

<a name="ocean"><h3>Oceanography</h3></a>

<P>Work has continued on the long term objectives of (i) improving the
estimates of ocean circulation and hence the quantitative knowledge of
the ocean's role in climate, and (ii) understanding the physical
processes involved in maintaining global ocean currents and how these
may vary.</P>

<P>Dr Sue Gray has joined the Oceanography group from the Department
of Meteorology, University of Reading, to work on the problem of
interpreting oceanic measurements of transient tracers to improve
knowledge of the ocean circulation.  We have implemented and tested a
boundary Green's function technique in an ocean general circulation
model.  We are now proceeding to ask whether, or not, the ocean tracer
observations are consistent with the best-estimate model flow
fields. </P>

<P>Related work considers the effect of mesoscale ocean eddy
variability on tracer fields.  We have used an eddy-resolving model to
create synthetic datasets and hence estimate the statistical
characteristics of the mesoscale tracer fields.  The preliminary
results suggest that these fluctuations are significantly larger than
the instrumental errors and must be well-known before a model/data
comparison can be attempted.</P>

<P>We are developing another technique to address the tracer inverse
problem: variational assimilation.  Using a new software tool we have
automatically constructed adjoint models corresponding to the general
circulation models used to simulate oceanic tracers.  These adjoint
models will now be used to efficiently perform the model/data fit. The
software tool promises to be very useful since many geophysical
inverse problems can be tackled including models with non-linear
dynamics.  A NERC funded research scientist will shortly join the
group to develop these techniques.</P>

<P>We have been analysing hydrographic and CFC observations from the
Southern Ocean to improve the knowledge of the water mass formation
processes and the abyssal circulation in the region.  Dense outflows,
carrying high CFC signals, can be traced over thousands of kilometres
revealing the path of the abyssal water into the Indian ocean.  The
ship data provide useful constraints on dynamical models for abyssal
water formation in the region and allow us to estimate the net
air/sea/ice fluxes of heat and freshwater.  Simple models have also
been constructed to constrain the speed and mixing of the deep ocean
currents: tasks crucial to understanding how the ocean regulates
Earth's climate.</P>

<a name="COAM"><h3>Coupled Ocean-Atmosphere Modelling</h3></a>

<P>AOPP has continued to develop its research programme in the field
of coupled ocean-atmosphere modelling.  Activities in this field are
facilitated by active participation in the UK Universities Global
Atmospheric Modelling Programme (UGAMP). The recent period has seen
several new developments.  A major landmark was the completion of a
ten year integration of the UGAMP tropical ocean-global atmosphere
coupled GCM.  The results of this integration have shed light on a
number of intriguing features of the tropical climate.  In parallel
with this work on the tropics we have been developing a new programme
of research focused on the role of ocean-atmosphere interactions in
the climate of the North Atlantic Region.  This work has been
stimulated by observational evidence we obtained (published in
<I>Nature</I> in August) suggesting significant decadal predictability
of North Atlantic Sea Surface Temperatures.  We are following up this
work with a wide range of studies aimed at better elucidating the
mechanisms involved, and assessing the predictability of natural
fluctuations in climate.</P>

<a name="finally"><h3>And Finally...</h3></a>

<P>The one-storey extension to the Atmospheric Physics Laboratory,
formerly the 'Old Zoology' building, adjacent to the Clarendon
Laboratory in the Science Area at Oxford was competed this year and is
now being occupied.  For the first time in its 75-year history,
Atmospheric Physics has all of the space it needs, having gradually in
the last 15 years taken over all of the OZ building, and having
extended it twice by building on.  The latest extension takers up most
of the former flat roof of the building, preserving a patio area for
experimental set-ups viewing the atmosphere (and for the traditional
year-round, open-air coffee ceremony at 11AM each day) and provides a
small laboratory, a meeting room, a canteen, and thirteen new offices.
The extra space means we are now able to reserve three offices for
academic visitors, at this moment in use by Prof. Gary Davis of the
University of Saskatchewan, Dr Athena Coustenis of the Observatoire de
Paris, and Dr Rodney Knight of the Rutherford Appleton Laboratory.  We
hope our collaborators and colleagues world-wide will avail themselves
of the new facilities when their schedules enable them to visit
Oxford. </P>

<P>We are not yet entirely free of building noise, as major
excavations are going on at ground level (in what was once the Zoology
Department's lecture theatre) to install the anti-vibration block,
wiring and plumbing for the HIRDLS test and calibration facility
(discussed above).  When this is finished, the appearance of the
original Victorian laboratory will be more or less restored, at least
from certain vantage points!</P>
