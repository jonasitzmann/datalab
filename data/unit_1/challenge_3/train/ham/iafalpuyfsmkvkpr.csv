The spacecraft is made up of the following sybsystems: command and data handling; communications; electrical power;
electrical distribution; guidance, navigation and control; propulsion, software and thermal countrol. Each system requires
designers, engineers, analysts and technicians with specialized training. A team of integration and test specialiss
assembles the observatory and tests it as a system, simulating the launch and on-orbit environments as closely as possible.
For example, the spacecraft is exposed to vibrations similar to what it would experience during launch. As the observatory
comes together, the flight operations team learns and practices how to operate the observatory before launch.

The Aura observatory was launched on a Delta II 7920 rocket from Vandenberg Air Force Base in California on July 15, 2004. 
<a href="mission/Aura_Brochure.pdf">Aura </a>
was launched into a near polar, sun-synchronous orbit of 438 miles (705 kilometers), with a period of approximately 100
minutes and a 1:45 PM equator crossing time. The spacecraft repeats its ground track every sixteen days.
