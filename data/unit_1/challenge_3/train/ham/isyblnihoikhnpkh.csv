<h2 align=center>INTRODUCTION</h2>

In this issue of Harvest, besides the usual ample sheaf of new web resources

and conference announcements, we offer our response to Chadwyck-Healey's

Literature Online. This is by far the most significant electronic resource

we have encountered, and the one of most certain relevance to CERES members.

So this is a moment at which stock should be taken with care. Will LION

change the way research is carried out, its aims, methods, and usefulness,

or will it go the way of other ambitious monsters from Typhon to Titanic? We

aim to assess its strengths and weaknesses, and to give a few navigational

hints to help you get the most from it.

<h2 align=center>ELECTRONIC RESOURCES</h2>

<p>

<strong>CAMBRIDGE ENGLISH FACULTY WEBSITE</strong><br>

Well, we could hardly fail to mention this could we? All Colin Burrow's own

work, it will soon include all course reading lists online - accessible only

from within cam.ac.uk - and already contains information on the Faculty's

teaching staff, under- and post-graduate courses, and a cute 'House of Fame'

history of Cambridge critics, all of which is accessible to anyone who wants

to know. Long overdue.  Find it at <a href=http://www.english.cam.ac.uk/> http://www.english.cam.ac.uk/</a>.

<p>

<strong>INTERNET LIBRARY OF EARLY JOURNALS</strong><br>

The ULs of Birmingham, Leeds, Manchester and Oxford are engaged in the ILEJ

project, which aims to provide Internet access to pages and indexes of the

following: Notes and Queries 1849-69, Blackwood's Magazine 1843- 63, The

Builder 1843-63, Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society 1758-78,

Gentleman's Magazine 1731-1831, The Annual Register 1758-78. Full-text

searching will be possible for some titles, although most pages will be

available as scanned images. Notes and Queries is the first journal

available: twelve volumes 1849-55 are already up and running, with the rest

to follow soon. For information and participation details, e-mail <a href=mailto:tsl@bodley.ox.ac.uk>Thaddeus

Lapinski</a> at <a href=mailto:tsl@bodley.ox.ac.uk> tsl@bodley.ox.ac.uk</a> or visit the project website: <a href=http://www.bodley.ox.ac.uk/ilej/> http://www.bodley.ox.ac.uk/ilej/</a>.

<strong>HOBY'S CASTIGLIONE HTML TEXT</strong><br>

Richard Bear at the University of Oregon has produced a neat but

unspectacular HTML edition of Hoby's 1561 translation of <cite>The Courtier</cite>. Only

the title page is there in facsimile but the rest (taken from Raleigh's 1900

edition) is all present and (apparently) correct. Links help you navigate

from section to section, but this is not a multi-media project by any means.

URL:  <a href=http://darkwing.uoregon.edu/~rbear/courtier/courtier.html>http://darkwing.uoregon.edu/~rbear/courtier/courtier.html</a>.

<p>

<strong>GLOBE WEBSITES</strong><br>

Not surprisingly the Globe Project has spawned a good website based at

Reading. It includes a Virtual Reality tour of the Globe (which means some

Quicktime movie clips), and an archive of material on staging, with

information on performance at the Globe in both its incarnations. URL:

<a href=http://www.rdg.ac.uk/globe/>http://www.rdg.ac.uk/globe/</a>.

<p>

There's an American Globe website which offers less specifically Globe- ish

content and links to lots of acting and teaching on-line resources. Its URL

is <a href=http://www.shakespeare.uiuc.edu> http://www.shakespeare.uiuc.edu</a>. This will take you to the low-graphics version. If you have a good Internet connection (i.e. not a modem) and an up-to-date browser (Netscape or Explorer version 3) then you could go for the 'High Bandwith' option which has more graphics and frames etc. The URL for going straight there is <a href=http://www.shakespeare.uiuc.edu/frametop.html> http://www.shakespeare.uiuc.edu/frametop.html</a>.

<p>

<strong>ARDEN WEBSITE</strong><br>

Details about the Arden CD-ROM and a brief history of the Arden Shakespeare

from its website at <a href=http://www.ardenshakespeare.com/> http://www.ardenshakespeare.com/</a>.

<p>

<strong>VIRTUAL DREAM</strong><br>

A very ambitious project indeed to produce a VR performance of MSND live on

the Internet, using spanking new VRML techniques (whatever they might be).

The project is looking for participants to help in the performance. There's

a website with details and the working script at <a href=http://www.shoc.com/vrmldream/> http://www.shoc.com/vrmldream/</a>.

<p>

<strong>PRINCETON UNIVERSITY LIBRARY AND FELLOWSHIPS</strong><br>

The Library is currently advertising its fellowships for the period May 1998

to April 1999. They have a value of up to $2,000 each and are meant to help

defray expenses in travelling to and residing in Princeton during the tenure

of the Fellowship. The length of the Fellowship will depend on the

applicant's research proposal, but is normally one month. For application

forms and info contact <a href=mailto:mgruscil@princeton.edu> mgruscil@princeton.edu</a>. The PUL's homepage with

catalogues, etc. is at <a href=http://infoshare1.princeton.edu:2003/> http://infoshare1.princeton.edu:2003/</a>.

<strong>DANTE RESOURCES</strong><br>

Otfried Lieberknecht has a Homepage for Dante Studies:

<a href=http://members.aol.com/lieberk/welcome.html> http://members.aol.com/lieberk/welcome.html</a>. And let's not forget about Dante Alighieri - A Guide to Online Resources: <a href=http://orb.rhodes.edu/encyclop/culture/lit/Italian/Danindex.html> http://orb.rhodes.edu/encyclop/culture/lit/Italian/Danindex.html</a>.

<strong>LATIN PLACE NAMES</strong><br>

If you want to be the kind of person who knows that Books printed in

Bratislava may tell you they are printed in Bosania, Bosonium, Bozanum,

Bozonium, or indeed Brecislaburgum there are two websites providing handy

quick-reference guides: <a href=http://www.lib.byu.edu/~catalog/people/rlm/latin/names.htm> http://www.lib.byu.edu/~catalog/people/rlm/latin/names.htm</a> and <a href=http://crane.ukc.ac.uk/semls/cathlibs/towns.htm> http://crane.ukc.ac.uk/semls/cathlibs/towns.htm</a>.

<h3 align=center>INTRODUCTION</h3>

For a number of years Chadwyck-Healey have been quietly knocking up

electronic texts of most of English Literature. Some of these have been

scanned in electronically; others have been typed in (for digital character

recognition software has still not worked its way back to an adequate

recognition of Renaissance typefaces). And apparently they have all been

checked. Generations of Cambridge undergraduates have been seen in summer

vacations at the University Library padding hollow-eyed from reading room to

tea room and back again contemplating the Augean labour of checking the

complete works of Thomas Shadwell or William Shenstone not for sense (for

that would be too much to ask) but for spelling. The results of this ongoing

project will be familiar to many already. For several years now CD-ROMS of

C-H's English Poetry and English Verse Drama databases have been in use in

academic libraries, and more recently has appeared the eminently useful if

flaccidly softwared 'Editions and Adaptations of Shakespeare' (See Digest I). Literature Online aims to unite all of C-H's databases under one

aegis. The benefits are 4-fold: (i) the databases can be searched

individually or together, as is not possible with a collection of CD-ROMS;

(ii) online access means that the customer will always be using the most

up-to-date versions both of the databases and of the searching software;

(iii) because the searching is done by the powerful C-H mainframes, and not

by a library PC, results are accessible more quickly, even when web download

times are allowed for; and (iv) the service is accessible from anywhere in

the world, so whole texts or search results can be downloaded direct to the

user's own computer.

<p>

LION (and we do love a good acronym) is wondrous, and we are already finding

it indispensable. However, it is important to know its limitations, and to

realise that for all its comprehensiveness and speed, it is still a very

blunt instrument where research is concerned. But it is clearly the most

significant online literary resource to date, and with its clear intent of

housing a comprehensive and ever-expanding range of services under one roof,

it looks like it will keep the lead it already has on any rivals; it is here

to stay. If your academic institution is not already thinking of

subscribing, put that thought in its mind. Even if LION's usefulness to you

is restricted to the most mundane of its capabilities - tracking down

quotations and phrases you cannot place - it is likely to save you time, and

it has not always been possible to say that about the infliction of

technological developments on our working lives in the last decades. First

of all, though, a guided tour.

<p>

LION has distinct URLs for the UK (<a href=http://lion.chadwyck.co.uk/>http://lion.chadwyck.co.uk/</a>) and the States (<a href=http://lion.chadwyck.com/>http://lion.chadwyck.com/</a>); obviously,

as ever, use the one closest to you. The home page looks the same whether

or not you have subscribed to the database. If you haven't, some links will

be turned off, and others will take you to information about the service

rather than to the service itself. If you have been granted access

temporarily you may have been given a special URL and password (e.g., for

reviewing purposes). But in most cases, LION lets subscribers straight in by

recognising the IP (Internet Protocol) address of the computer accessing it.

This may be a library computer; in the event of large-scale licenses being

granted, it may be any

computer within a certain domain (e.g. cam.ac.uk). [If you need to know your

IP address, you can get LION to tell you what your computer is telling it by

going to http://lion.chadwyck.co.uk/envtest.cgi]. Multiple-user licenses

will allow a limited number of concurrent users to access each database;

these tend to allow more users for the more popular databases (verse) than

for the less (Early English Prose Fiction), so it is just possible that

access will be denied because 5 other people are also trying to get to grips

with Nashe and Greene. Information about arranging trials is of course

available at the home page.

<p>

As well as recognising your computer, LION will recognise your browser

software; sort of. There are two versions of Literature Online. One uses

'frames', which means that some areas of the page remain intact when you

download some new stuff. This protocol has speed advantages, but it is also

governed by a more complicated logic. Where traditionally each page you saw

had a separate URL, so that your browser knew what it was showing you, with

frames this is not the case. So if you try to use the back/forward buttons

on your browser, you may find that things get rather muddling (see below).

The frames version of LION is optimised to run with Netscape Navigator

version 3.0 or higher, which uses Java scripts to reinstate an intuitive

back/forward option presented within the page rather than via your browser's

toolbar. Internet Explorer 3 also has frames capability, so if you access

LION with this software you will get the frames version, but the

back/forward option may not work. As usual, you are most likely to have

problems with older browsers and non-Windows 95 machines. We have not

experimented with every configuration of hardware and software, but in many

cases problems arising from the frames version of LION can be avoided by

going to the non-frames version, whither you will be sent automatically if

LION recognises that you have a non-frames-aware browser such as Netscape

Navigator 1.2. Follow the links, or go straight to

<a href=http://lion.chadwyck.co.uk/noframes/home/home> http://lion.chadwyck.co.uk/noframes/home/home</a>.  In essence this is exactly the same as the frames version, except that LION's own buttons are on the left instead of the right, and the whole is painted a more lurid orange. Some procedures have more stages to them, but the non-frames version is in no way less powerful or flexible. You may also find it faster, for complicated reasons involving caches which you don't

want to know about.

<h3 align=center>REFERENCE WORKS</h3>

Literature Online contains the following reference works:

<ul>

<li><strong>Annual Bibliography of English Language and Literature</strong>:

ABELL aims to list monographs, periodical articles, critical editions of

literary works, book reviews, collections of essays and doctoral

dissertations published anywhere in the world. The bibliography consists of

69 volumes beginning in 1920 and issued annually in printed volumes. It is

not in practice as up to date as BIDS/First Search, but it is very full.

<li><strong>Bibliography of American Literature</strong>: BAL contains nearly 40,000 records of the literary works of approximately 300 American

writers from the period of the Revolution to 1930.

<li><strong>The King James Bible - 'Authorized' Version</strong>:  

The King James - 'Authorized' Version is included to provide a single Bible

for reference purposes. Boxes on the search form (fill in any or all) allow

searching by keyword, testament, and book, and a 'Go to' option can take you

direct to any specified point. The full text is hypertexted with, e.g.,

concordance notes. Perhaps an accident, but certainly a blessing; the choice

of the AV means that this will be very useful for tracing allusions and

quotations direct, without getting sent to other people's allusions and

quotations.

<li><strong>Periodicals Contents Index--Literature</strong>:  

An index to over 800,000 periodical articles in the field of literature from

1857 to present day. The focus is upon journals produced in the twentieth

century, but those beginning in the nineteenth century and continuing into

the twentieth are published from their inception. Perhaps that might be

extended one day to include major C19 journals which didn't outlive their

queen. Nevertheless, very nice, this, as it makes far more likely the

noticing (and less likely the duplicating) of all that fantastic Victorian

scholarship so often buried in the Proceedings of the Bognor Philological

Society and Antiquaries Club. Very good also for reviews of things literary

from past decades. Past scholarship becomes as noisy as present, almost, and

the balance of accessibility and retrieval is redressed somewhat.

<li><strong>Webster's Third New International Dictionary, Unabridged</strong>:  

America's premier lexicographical work; the 1993 edition is published here

in electronic form for the first time. A dictionary of the English language

containing 450,000 vocabulary entries. Searching is done by filling in any

or all of boxes Headword, Keyword, Etymology Keyword, Author/Quotation

Keyword, Part of Speech. This would be even more useful if it were the UK's

premier lexicographical work. But we don't wave flags.

</ul>

<p>
<hr align=center width=75%>

<a name=websources></a>

<h3 align=center>WEB RESOURCES</h3>

Rather surprisingly, LION is fully aware of the wider world's web of

complementary services, and so provides sample lists of, and links to, web

resources indexed under categories (Discussion Lists and Groups, Author

Pages, Research Resources, Journals) and periods. These are all right,

though neither very up to date nor all that comprehensive. But the awareness

of the WWW is also integrated into the searching facilities to some extent,

as we shall see below.

<p>
<hr align=center width=75%>

<a name=help>

<h3 align=center>HELP</h3>

There is help available for each database, and at each point of entry to a

search. At the home page Help these are listed. It's probably worth looking

at 'Navigating Literature Online' here, and at the index of help topics for

searching the literary databases in order to get to a useful summary of the

different search options, including boolean operators (x and/or/not y),

proximity searching (x near y), and truncation (truncat*).

<p>
<hr align=center width=75%>

<a name=litdbases>

<h3 align=center>LITERARY DATABASES</h3>

Literature Online contains the following literary databases:

<ul>

<li><cite>All</cite><br>

Allows searching of all the literary databases together.

<li><cite>African-American Poetry (1750-1900)</cite><br>

Nearly 3,000 poems written by African-American poets in the late eighteenth

and nineteenth centuries.

</ul>

<p>
<hr align=center width=75%>

<a name=master></a>

<h3 align=center>MASTER INDEX</h3>

The Master Index allows searching of the entire database, including its

records of e-texts available elsewhere on the WWW, by author or title. It

does not search full texts. Type a surname and go, or browse to get a box to

look for the exact form of a name. [Remember with all such web- forms to

click on the box you want to enter text in, and that tab/shift+tab will take

you back and forward between boxes.] A search on an author will return all

his or her works, with separate poems indexed individually; so this is not

perhaps the quickest way to see what's there. The title keyword search is

good. For instance, one could search for everything with 'English' in its

title, or mentioning someone's name; at this point the separate indexing of

titles of poems is useful, as name searches will return good stocks of

dedicatory epistles and epigrams. Boolean and truncation searches work here;

these are very good in our period at finding variant forms of names. The

truncation can only be made at the end of a phrase so search 'Lucy Countess*

or Lucie Countess* or Lucye Countess*' but 'Countess of Bedford* or

Countesse of Bedford*' to allow for all likely variants. Punctuation marks

are ignored in searches so the first will not fail to find 'Lucy,

Countess...'. Truncations are also good for names adjectivised. Remember

with all searches that if your search term contains any of the logical

operators (and, or, not, near) you must put it in inverted commas.  For example, <cite>trouble and strife</cite> will find all documents containing both words, whereas

<cite>'trouble and strife'</cite> will find only instances of the whole phrase.

<p>

The browse option will give you a list of every word which occurs in a

title/author field in the whole database, with the number of occurences, so

you can browse the entire lexicon if you have the patience. By using ctrl

and then clicking you can select any number of these, to arrange a multiple

author search, or a title search like:<br>

"arcades" OR "arcadi" OR "arcadia" OR "arcadian" OR "arcadians" OR

"arcadias" OR "arcadie" OR "arcady" OR "arcadye"<br>

This is how LION displays an ideal search by the way, for clarity's sake,

though of course you would get the same results from:

<br>arcades or arcadi or arcadia or arcadian or arcadians or arcadias or arcadie

or arcady or arcadye<br>

The software will show you 50 entries at a time unless you tell it to show

more (up to 99). This is worth adjusting on some occasions, so as to avoid

multiple pages of search results which can get in the way of a quick browse

back and forth.

<p>

Having specified your search criteria and got some results you may wish to

get back to your search box (to make some alterations) by using your

browser's 'back' button. Do not be surprised if on going back to the search

page you find that it is now blank again. This may not always happen, and it

will happen less if you use the non-frames version of LION, or the Java

back/forward facility incorporated in the frames version. But to avoid it,

notice that clicking the search icon in the results page allows you to

'refine search'. This will take you straight back to the search page, with

your search criteria preserved. Usually.

<p>

A summary of the stages of searching the master index...

<ol type=1>

<li>Search

<li>Summary of matches and the databases in which they occur. Click (i)

highlighted text for the record OR (ii) piece of paper icon to its right for

a contextual table of contents (most commonly the contents of the complete

poems or plays or prose fiction of the author concerned). Also displayed on

this page are the titles and URLs of any e-texts at other websites of which

LION is aware.

<li><ol type=i>

<li>Full text record within particular database with the option now of

going to the text or to the contextual table of contents

<li>Contextual table of contents, every item of which is highlighted.

These are tabulated in a hierarchical way, the more indented entries being

subsets of the less indented ones above them. There are some funny icons to

the left of each item; the lozenge shaped one will display the same table of

contents with more 'context' for that item; the other one will do it with

less. This is all rather complicated and vexatious, but you'll work it out

if you want to. The point of it is to enable you to select exactly the form

in which you finally get your text, either, for instance, the single sonnet,

or the whole sequence, or the whole volume.

</ol>

<cite>NB If at this stage (3) you click on 'refine search' it will take you not to

the search you were conducting but to a page enabling you to search the

particular database you are now in. Not a bug; but a pest.</cite>

<li>4.  Text at last (refine search works as above)

</ol>

<p>

You might want at this point to save or print your text. There are various

options. You could cover some with the mouse, and copy and paste it

somewhere else. You could select all the text via 'edit' on the menu bar,

though with older, smaller RAMed machines there may be a limit to the amount

of text the computer can paste in one go. You could do clever things with

the right mouse button if you know how to do that. Note that this is another

stage at which the frames version of LION may upset you. If you have a page

of text in front of you and try to save it as a file, your computer may save

the upper frame of icons because that was the last thing it downloaded and

that is where it is. So you may need first to click on the text itself;

there will be no visible effect, but your computer will now be where you

are. Another question is in what form to save the text. If you save it as a

file, you will have to save it as html (.html or .htm). This includes all

the codes around the text telling your machine how to display it. If you try

to save it as text (.txt) you will still get all the html codes. Only by

copying and pasting will the text and only the text be translated into .txt.

BUT, saving as html has advantages, such as preserving italics, which are

lost when text becomes txt. And if you have swanky Word 97 for Windows 95,

you word processor will be able to display html files anyway. Bear in mind

that in some situations you will want to print off the text but will not be

that fussed about keeping an electronic copy. In which case consider

printing direct from your web browser, a much underused option. In the

non-frames version you will get all the supporting icons and pictures, but

not in the frames version, which will give you only the text part of the

page (but remember to click on the text first...!)

<p>

Using Master Index you can also retrieve a number of hits by sampling (you

specify the number). There is not much point to this, except for journalists

and students wanting to stick a pin in the complete poems of X (in which

case, better surely to browse the contents page of a real live book), or to

get a representative selection of poetic sentiments on the theme of meadows

or lust.

<p>

A word about LION's texts. A number of factors have the potential to

vitiate the texts available on LION. For copyright reasons many of the

texts on LION are less than up to date. Where possible, particularly in

their earlier databases (poetry and drama) C-H have taken texts from

modern editions out of copyright. This tends to mean that they are by

Grosart. If this does not worry you, read Sprague's tactful remarks on

the good reverend's shortcomings in his edition of Daniel's poems. Where

this has not been possible, they have gone back to the original printed

text. In some cases (like the excellent new Early English Prose Fiction

database) they seem to have done this as a first option, so,

delightfully, we get not Feuillerat's Sidney's Arcadia, but an edition

of the 1593 text. Minor authors, represented sometimes in their entirety

from the original texts, complete with preliminaries, are often better

represented than very major ones, available only via a poor and

incomplete 'collected' edition. Also, the electronic versions of

original texts are usually more satisfying, and easier to navigate, than

the e-texts of modern collected editions. It is much simpler to survey

and sample the complete works of a writer if, say, his 20 publications

are listed on screen as such - and are then available complete with

publication details from the title page and preliminaries - rather than

splattered across a single collected edition which doesn't give their

dates and hasn't included dedications. In this medium 20 small virtual

volumes are easier to work with than one big one. In general, then,

expect a mish-mash of both old and modern spelling editions, and adjust

your searches to allow for this. But be aware that some of the texts are

riddled with errors, either because of poor typing or checking, or

because scanning is rather haphazard (a poorly printed e will often be

read by the character recognition software as a c, for example). In many

cases, a text (and in some cases an author) is simply not there at all.

Recent changes in copyright law (i.e. the extension of the copyright

period) mean that while Hebel's Drayton was on the verse CD-ROM, it is

not on LION. So if you are using LION for cross-sectional lexical

searches of the whole of English Literature, you will need to acquire a

sense of what is missing. There are pleasant surprises, however. It

looks like where a text was first printed only in recent times (and a

great many women's manuscript works fall under this category) C-H have

in some cases been able to get hold of e-texts of (portions of)

copyright editions. So some texts are well-edited, and accurately

digitised. LION is in many ways most useful not for providing access to

electronic versions of texts we all possess, but in allowing ready and

alternative access to the sorts of texts which one can most often only

read on UMI microfilms, the sort of 2 copies in the world texts like

Markham's English Arcadia [imagine your reviewer's excitement!] or

Gamage's Linsi-Woolsie. It is also great for containing vast amounts of

lousy C18-C19 poetry and drama - and, indeed, for searching through it

with no nose for quality -, and so is particularly well adapted to

reception history sorts of projects (I found a frightening number of

poems about Sidney at Zutphen).

<p>

The division of portions of text means that any lump of data with a

title can be accessed separately. So one can go direct to a single

sonnet, which will appear on a page of its own. One can then back up to

its context, and display the whole run of sonnets, or whatever. At first

this is really annoying. But once you start using LION not just to

browse texts, but to conduct tightly specified searches, your annoyance

transfers to the texts which are not so generously pieced up. Machines

with less than 16MB RAM have problems displaying large files, and where

the smallest portion of a novel or play is 50 or 300K, the computer will

freeze up and think a lot before it finishes processing it. Not to

mention the more familiar slow downloading problems. So if you are not

downloading such a text to keep but just to glance at the occurrence of

a word or phrase, time can be consumed. But LION is very well organised

in telling you the size of every file it offers you, and in giving a

reasonable amount of text surrounding each 'hit', so you can decide when

to bother, and when to use LION to direct you to a place in a paper

book.

<p>

Annotations are a problem. Texts, like Jonson's editions of his own

works, which come already annotated have had their notes included in the

databases, but these are always in separate files, one file per note.

This is the most irritating feature of LION. It is simply not possible

to see all the notes at once, to know what is in a note before

downloading it (although its size is displayed), or, if one wishes to

download a text for keeps, to include the notes in the text's file.

Sometimes such annotations are essential to a text, but the software

discourages one from bothering either to read them, or to download each

and every one if one is compiling one's own library of e-texts (which,

by the way, is fully allowed by C-H who accept that they cannot hope to

keep hold of every bit of text, but know that they will remain unique in

providing the facility to search them all). Why oh why cannot the

software find a way of sticking the relevant notes at the bottom of the

page?

<p>

So much for the digression, and for the master index. Now for ways of

searching the meat of the databases...

<p>
<hr align=center width=75%>

<h3 align=center>SEARCHING LITERARY DATABASES</h3>

<p>

Each of the databases can be searched in one of three ways

<ol type=1>

<li>via the master index (dealt with above)

<li>via the search all literary databases option

<li>individually, for the most sophisticated search options

</ol>

<p>

<strong>SEARCH ALL</strong><br>

1.  This option allows searching of the full texts (including dedicatory

matter, etc.) by keyword or author; once again, fill either or both boxes

either directly or by browsing and selecting; then press the search button.

This is the best way to search all the literary texts in LION for

occurrences of words; as noted above truncations are essential for old

spelling, as are boolean operators; remember to allow for some needlessly

preserved old-spelling oddities like vv for w; truncations are also good for

getting a variety of word-forms from a common stem. For instance, 'Sidne* or

Sydne*' will find most references to Sidneys, Sidneians, Sidneides, and the

Sidneyesque.

<p>

2.  Having submitted your search, you will have returned to you a 'Summary

of Matches'; these are listed by database, and each entry tells you how many

hits are in each database, and under how many separate entries (e.g. there

may be only three hits in only one text so you will be told 3 matches and 1

entry). Click on the highlighted database names and you will enter the

particular database (e.g. early prose fiction)...

<p>

3.  Summary of matches within database. This page lists each entry (not each

match) separately by author and title of work; it tells you how many matches

are in each entry, and offers the table of contents icon; scroll down this

page, and if necessary any following pages for 50+ entries (though you can

again circumvent this by specifying that the search display up to 99 entries

per page). Click on an interesting looking one, either the highlighted title

(i), or the TOC icon (ii)...

<p>

4.  (i) Context of matches. This page tells you more precisely what the hit

is, and gives you a good few words of context, usually enough to determine

whether or not to go further. This page will also offer a number of ways

into the text: for instance, just the text, or the text plus prefatory

matter, or the whole edition from which it is taken...<br>

    (ii) Contextual table of contents, which works as described above when

we got there via the Master Index

<p>

5.  Text. This will be flagged with icons (called 'first hit' or 'next hit')

which will jump you to the point in the text at which the match(es)

occur(s). It will also offer you the contextual TOC, which you may want to

look at if you came direct via 4 (i).

<p>

At each of the above stages you can start a new search or refine your

search. As noted in the master index section, once you have started to look

at information specific to one database (stage 3 above), clicking on the

search icon (the magnifying glass) may take you to a search box for that one

database only. We are slightly confused by this, as it appears to work

inconsistently by database, and by frames/non-frames interface. Clearly C-H

should allow access to both sorts of search page from every point in such a

search.

<p>
<hr align=center width=75%>

<a name=searching></a>

<h3 align=center>SEARCHING INDIVIDUAL DATABASES</h3>

Searching a single database is an option all along of course. From the home

page go to the literary databases, and select not 'search all' but the

particular database you need. The search pages for individual databases are

much more complex and flexible. For the verse database, for instance, you

can search for key words or phrases in the text or in the titles or first

lines only; you can restrict the search to authors of one or other gender;

you can search only rhymed, or only unrhymed, poems; you can exclude or

include apparatus, dedicatory material, arguments, and epigraphs; and you

can limit the period. In all cases click on the arrows to the right of the

boxes for the list of options. The list of periods here is interesting,

because it is not really or only that, but a quite helpful series of

categories under which texts have been grouped, such as 'Emblems, Epigrams,

Formal Satires, 1500- 1700' and 'Songbooks, 1500-1700'. Again, in the drama

database you can search by keyword, play, title, speaker, playwright, genre,

period, gender, date first performed, and date first published. You can

always tell which database you are in because there will be a representative

mugshot above the toolbar, so verse has Tennyson, Early English Prose

Fiction has Bunyan, and Drama has some rouge-cheeked bloke in a wig. If you

get lost, however, use the LION toolbar to take you back to the Master Index

or Literary Databases start points.

<p>

Going back and forth is the whole problem with frames, and the reason why

you may need to consider using the non-frames version - except perhaps for

printing things off - even if your browser displays frames. Typically you

will search all the databases at once, you will get a summary of matches,

you will view the summary for a particular database, and perhaps you will

look at the context of a particular entry. Very often you will not download

the text, because you are really only browsing. You will then press the

'back' button on your browser to go back up to the summary of matches in

order to view the entries in another database. In frames, you will probably

get a blank screen; pressing 'back' again will take you back to the search

page, which will be empty or will perhaps contain a search you conducted

previously; to get your search results, you will have to resubmit your

search. If this happens, and LION's own back/forward buttons don't work, use

the non- frames version of LION, which ought to work more logically. It took

us a while to work this out, because C-H don't like to trumpet their

shortcomings too loudly. Even without frames you may still find your search

criteria have been lost when you back up to the search page; the best way

round this is to use 'refine search' to get back to this page, though, as

noted above, sometimes this will give you the wrong sort of search page.

Clearly, C-H need to think about making it possible to jump straight from

any point in a search back to a previous one; for example (most obviously)

from a full text within a particular database to the summary of matches

across all the databases. The safest thing to do if you are worried about

losing your search criteria is to use a clever clipboard like 'Clipmate'

(available from HENSA) to keep the criteria safe, or to copy them once

entered (using the browser's edit menu, which, as we are constantly

observing, you must get into the habit of using to copy URLs from Harvest to

your browser's address box; we worry about you...) into a dummy word

processor document. It is very vexing to come up with a beautiful search

term like <cite>fresh field* or freshe field* or fresh feeld* or freshe feeld*</cite> only to find it lost.

<p>

While we're on the subject of search criteria, we very much like the 'near'

option. This finds two words within 10 words of each other (it doesn't

matter which order you give them in). If you add a full stop and a number

you can alter the range to, say, within 5 words, or 20: <cite>hand near.15 foot</cite>.  

By the way, LION does not allow, as does AltaVista's advanced searching,

parentheses like the following, and it ought to: <cite>(fresh field* or freshe field* or fresh feeld* or freshe feeld*) near pastures new*</cite>.  Because <cite>fresh field* or freshe field* or fresh feeld* or freshe feeld* near pastures new*</cite> will only match the last variant to 'pastures new*'.

<p>
<hr align=center width=75%>

<a name=summary>

<h3 align=center>CAVEAT, SUMMARY</h3>

<p>

<strong>HAVE WE COVERED EVERYTHING?</strong><br>

No. There are many features we have scarcely touched on, such as quick

referencing links from the full text page to the dictionary, and other

pieces of padding. We are aware that some of the information above is

confusing, and that in some cases this is because we are confused. But this

confusion is heuristic. Be confused by our confusion, and you will be half

way to acquiring the instincts necessary to cope with LION's eccentricities.

We hope that you will be encouraged to explore LION, or to arrange a trial

at your institution. It is certainly a way forward. But they must improve

their software. In particular, navigation is poor, and their grasp of the

point and function of hypertextual layers to texts is not good, though they

are hampered by the rather impossible constraints of the ways they chose to

input and demarcate the zillions of bytes of information they possess when

they first began to input them many years ago. Chadwyck-Healey are certainly

to be congratulated on what they have come up with so far. LION's databases

are awesome; their computers search it and return results to you with

exemplary speed; and the appearance of LION is attractive and user-friendly.

Searches are flexible, though do not quite allow the complexity sometimes

needed. It is to be hoped that they will respond to criticism, that they

will improve texts when they can, that they will replace Grosart editions

with better texts as these come out of copyright, and that they will find a

way of filling some of the big name gaps like Spenser. As an indication of

their momentum, just look at what is coming soon to LION:

<ul>

<li>Carcanet poets (Sept. 97): all Carcanet's contemporary poets, in toto

<li>Cambridge Encyclopedia and Cambridge Biographical Encyclopedia (Sept. 97):

not a leap into more general territories but, ostensibly, a resource to help

LION users identify references in the texts

<li>Master Index upgrade taking responses into account, and software

enhancements. (Enhancements to the LION software will be released every

three months.)

</ul>

<p>

AND, the next upload of Literature Online will include further literary

databases including Editions and Adaptations of Shakespeare, English Prose

Drama, and a collection of contemporary English Poetry. There will also be

an update to ABELL.

<p>

<strong>SUMMARY</strong><br>

LION is a very fine thing. But, for the very expensive service that it is,

it is also a very flawed thing. Its software will improve, and like all

online services you will always find it easier to use with a powerful PC/Mac

and the most up to date browser. But it will never get rid of all its typos,

or the omissions and emissions of the poorer of the editions it has had to

use, and I for one am not about to start e- mailing C-H every time I detect

an error. So it will find you a great many things you would never have known

about without it, though it will not find all the things it might if it were

100 percent accurate, or if it contained absolutely every English literary

text, as one day it will. And if you use it not to find new stuff but to

search texts you have read or at least heard of for occurrences of words and

phrases, know that it may miss a few. It will usually find you what you

need, but sometimes it won't, because that poem is set in Ardadia, and this

is addressed to VVatson. Use it with a wariness of its weaknesses as well as

an understanding of its strengths.
