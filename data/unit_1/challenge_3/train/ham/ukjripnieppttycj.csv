                      Foundation Degree in Supporting Learning? </span></p>
                    <p>The Foundation Degree in Supporting Learning is a part-time  work-based degree course, normally lasting two years but may be completed over  three or four years. There are flexible entry points. The required attendance  is one session per week.</p>
                    <p>This course is aimed at people who support learning in  educational child care settings and provides opportunities for them to develop  their professional understanding, knowledge and key skills while working. The  course content draws from and provides a strong academic underpinning for  practical working experience. Successful completion results in 240 higher education  credits, 120 at Level 1 and 120 at Level 2.</p>
                    <p>The principal aims of the programme are to widen access into  higher education and to enhance the career prospect of those whose role is to  support learning, by placing value on skills gained through working experience  and enabling participants to acquire knowledge and understanding related to the  roles in which they are currently employed. The course content is related to generic  educational practice and issues affecting participants who are currently supporting  the learning of pupils with a wide range of ages and circumstances. The  development of the ability to engage in reading, reflection, debate and enquiry  is an ongoing component of the programme. </p>
                    <p>The course provides a strong foundation of knowledge and  understanding for all those who work supporting learning in educational  settings, which may also be the basis for an alternative or work-based route  into teaching or other careers involving work with learners in educational  settings.</p>

                    <p>The Foundation Degree consists of twelve six-week courses. 
                      You will undertake 6 courses, each worth 20 credits, at 
                      level 1 and 6 courses, again each worth 20 credits, at level 
                      2. Each course consists of 30 hours tuition time, and includes 
                      specified tasks, activities at the work base and independent 
                      study. The normal starting point of the  course is September but students may also start the course at other points e.g.  January or April.</p>
                    <p>Each course will be assessed using a variety of methods 
                      such as short presentations, reflections on observations 
                      or tasks carried out in your work place, short essays etc.. 
                      You will be given support in carrying out these assessments 
                      as it is recognised that, for some people, formal study 
                      may not have been undertaken for some time.</p>
