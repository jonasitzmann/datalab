  <h1 align="center">Lectures, Seminars and Supervisions </h1>
  <p>Teaching in the English Faculty, as in most Cambridge Faculties, takes three main forms: Lectures, Seminars and Supervisions.</p>
  <p>Lectures are arranged centrally by the Faculty. They last about fifty minutes, and usually a lecturer offers a course of eight lectures, one in each week of full term. There are no compulsory lectures, and students are free to attend lectures on areas which appeal to them and which are given by lecturers whose style they like. Some are on general topics, others are on particular authors. </p>
  <p>Seminars are also arranged on a wide variety of topics. These usually consist of groups of around ten undergraduates, who meet to discuss their work with one or more members of the Faculty. Discussions are often informal, and there is usually plenty of opportunity for undergraduates to contribute. The bulk of seminar work is concentrated in Part II when each specialised paper has a corresponding seminar. </p>
  <p>At supervisions undergraduates discuss their recent work with a supervisor. For many students this is their chief point of contact during a regular week with a member of the Faculty. The supervisor is very often a Fellow in English at the student's own College. Many Colleges, however, also send their students to see experts from other Colleges for some subjects. Since supervisions are arranged by the Colleges rather than by the Faculty, what happens in them varies from College to College. Usually they last about an hour and take place once a week; usually they consist of two undergraduates and one supervisor; and usually each undergraduate would write an essay on a different topic for each weekly supervision. </p>
  <p>Each College, however, adopts a slightly different way of teaching: some favour larger classes to encourage undergraduates to exchange ideas; others favour smaller groups for intensive discussion. Some encourage undergraduates to produce written work each week, in order to develop breadth of reading and fluency of essay-writing; others prefer to give undergraduates a longer period to engage in intensive study. </p>
  <p>The supervision system does make great demands on students, both to defend their corner in discussions, and to organise their time around them. It also offers potentially the most stimulating form of education there is.</p>
