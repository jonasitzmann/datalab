Format of logged data file.                           (Updated 4 January 2002).

File names are of the form MLmmddyy.CSV where mm, dd and yy are the two digit
month, day and year values. Files span one day. The files may have been zipped
to save space (they compress by a factor of more than 10), in which case they
will have a name of MLmmddyy.ZIP. It is also possible that they will have this
name but with a different case, e.g. MLmmddyy.csv, mlmmddyy.CSV, etc..

The file MLlatest.CSV will also be present and in the same format. This gives
the file that is being built up for the current day. It is normally
transferred about every 10 minutes. The final record is normally incomplete.

File MLDUMMY.CSV and MLDUMMY.ZIP are normally also present; they are empty and
should be ignored. They are present to help make the wildcard transfers more
robust.

MLmmddyy.CSV files are in ASCII text with lines up to 80 characters; the file
is terminated by a form-feed.

Where a comment is required in the file, this will occupy the first record,
and will begin and end with double quote, so that it will be stored in the
first cell if the file is read by a spreadsheet program. If more extensive
information needs to be conveyed, the comment will refer to a separate file.

There is one line per time entry;. Entries are normally spaced by a few
seconds, but this interval may vary, possibly being less for special purposes,
a few minutes where a new version of the software was being tested, or much
longer where there was a failure. The interval will never be less than 1
second. Note that rainfall and sunshine entries give the increment since the
last entry, so totals should not be lost when logging ceases for some time, and
the first entry after a gap could be unusually high.

Items are separated by commas. Spaces are also present, but should not be
relied upon, and the files may at some stage be processed to remove them in
order to save space.

The file can be read by spreadsheets as a comma-delimited file (an Excel
CSV file).

Where a problem has occurred, the last line may be incomplete, and it may be
useful to check for this when writing any programs.
 

Item 1:  Date of reading; month, day, year as dd-mm-yyyy (i.e. European format);
         prior to 4 Jan 2002 the format was mm-dd-yyy (US format).
Item 2:  Universal time (i.e. GMT) of reading; hours, min, sec as hh:mm:ss. 
Item 3:  Wind direction, from which wind is blowing; integer in range 0-255;
         scaling is such that 0-256 is mapped onto 0-360 deg.
Item 4:  Wind speed; integer in range 0-255; units are knots; 
         1 knot = 0.514 m/sec = 1.852 km/hour = 1.151 miles/hour.
Item 5:  Dry bulb temperature; integer in range 0-255; see table below for
         scaling.
Item 6:  Sunshine amount since last reading; integer in range 0-255; units of
         36 sec (0.01 hour).
Item 7:  Precipitation amount since last reading; integer in range 0-65535;
         units of 0.01 mm.
Item 8:  Pressure; integer in range 0-255; add 900 to obtain pressure in hPa.
Item 9:  Relative humidity: integer in range 0-255; units are percent (should
         not exceed 100).
Item 10: Wet bulb temperature; integer in range 0-255; see table below for 
         scaling.



Temperature conversion:
Subtracting 112 and multiplying by 2.5 is approximately correct to obtain the
temperature in C. For accurate results the following conversion table should
be used:

Reading.      Temperature (C).

     29            -40
     44            -30
     63            -20
     87            -10
     112            0
     137            10
     160            20
     181            30
     200            40
     216            50

This has been fitted by a polynomial where x=(d-112)*0.01 and d is the data
value. The fitted temperatures (C) are given approximately by:
       T = A*x + B*x*x + C*x*x*x + D*x*x*x*x + E*x*x*x*x*x
where
A=39.45288  B=2.312172  C=6.805814  D=-6.26714  E=5.040324
