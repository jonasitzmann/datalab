<HR>
<B>MORSE</B> <i>should</i> intercept any error condition arising from
user-input and print a helpful message to the terminal and the
<a href=outputs.html#log><b>morse.log</b> file</a>.
<P>
If, when <a href=run.html>running <B>MORSE</b></a>, 
instead of the standard set of messages to the terminal
beginning <B>'R-...'</b> or
<b>'I-...'</b> you get a message beginning <b>'F-...'</b> a fatal
error has been detected and the program stops at that point.
The same error message will have been 
printed as the last record in the <b>morse.log</b> file so
you don't need to remember it (unless, of course, the error occurred
while writing a different message to the log file itself).
<P>
These messages always start with
<B>F-ABCDEF:...</b> where <B>ABCDEF</B> (usually 6 characters)
is the subroutine module <b>abcdef.for</b> 
where the error was detected. 
<P>
Almost always fatal errors will occur while
the driver table is being read or the calculations are being set up,
ie <i>before</i> the first message <B>I-MORSE: Processing ...</b>
gets printed to the screen. 

<P> 
Most errors will either be due to 
<DL>
<DT> <B>F-DRVKEY: Error reading driver table: ...</b>
<DD> Incorrectly structured driver table.
<DT> <B>F-DRVXYZ: ...</b>
<DD> Error attempting to read the <b>*XYZ</b> section of driver table
<DT> <b>F-OPNFIL: I/O failure on file. IOSTAT=         29</b> (or some
other number than <b>29</b>, depending on machine and problem).
<DD> Error finding/reading file, check <b><a
href=outputs.html#log>morse.log</a></b> for the file that
    it was attempting to open
<DT> <b>F-ABCDEF: ... <b>MAXXYZ</b> too small ...</b> (or some other message
involving a parameter <B>MAX...</b>)
<DD> Parameters beginning <B>MAX...</B> are array sizes, stored in 
    module <b>rfmsiz.inc</B>
</dl>
If the message isn't self-evident,
it is usually useful to read the file 
<b><a href=outputs.html#log>morse.log</a></b> to check
the most recently attempted operation, eg which section of the driver
table was being read or file was being opened. If it still isn't clear,
check that the last record of the driver table (<B>*END</B>) has
a carriage return <B><CR></b> at the end of it!
<P>
There are a further class of error messages of the form
<DL>
<DT> <B>F-ABCDEF: Logical Error</b>
<DD> Which refer to unexpected conditions which have arisen 
(eg falling off the end of a DO loop) due to an internal coding
error rather than any user-input. In these cases, please
<a href=mailto:dudhia@atm.ox.ac.uk>inform me</a>.
