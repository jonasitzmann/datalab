<p>Research and postgraduate study at the GSA seeks to integrate the highest levels of practice-led, studio-based and theoretical approaches, providing opportunities for ambitious students to build on previous undergraduate or professional experience and to reflect on and develop personal practice. Through working within a highly focused community framework students develop the necessary confidence and independence to proceed into a range of careers - fashion, textiles, design, architecture - or the path of a practicing artist.</p><p>The ethos of the GSA is all about becoming a motivated and independent creative thinker and practitioner within today's international arena. The place of the research community within this vision is central. Research at the school is outward facing - in other words we encourage our undergraduates and postgraduates to connect actively with the processes and outcomes of visual research. </p><p>Please follow the link on the left to learn more about research at GSA.</p>
