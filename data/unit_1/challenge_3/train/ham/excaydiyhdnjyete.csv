			<P>Dear Colleagues, </P>
<P>I am very pleased to present to you two documents that will provide valuable background information about the day-to-day work programme, key objectives and high level strategic aspirations of the Children, Families &amp; Schools Directorate. </P>
<P>These documents have been produced following detailed research and consultation with staff within the Children, Families &amp; Schools Directorate, the people and organisations we work with on a daily basis and our external partners, both in Health and across the City as a whole. </P>
<P>Firstly, the <A href="/downloads/education/education_online/key_documents/central_services/planning_for_the_future/Children_Families___Schools_DDPV3__2003-04.doc">Children, Families &amp; Schools Directorate Development Plan </A>(CFS DDP). This document sets out the Directorate&rsquo;s key strategic vision, objectives and action plans for the period April 2003 to October 2004. It is a summary of the detailed team plans which have been prepared across the Directorate and is intended as a working document against which our progress will be monitored and reviewed. This Plan presents a useful insight into the strides we are taking towards the establishment of a truly integrated service for Children, Families &amp; Schools in our City. </P>
<P>Secondly, the Expression of Interest document entitled &lsquo;<A href="/downloads/education_online/key_documents/central_services/planning_for_the_future/Final_Children's_Trust_Bid.doc">A Children&rsquo;s Trust for Brighton &amp; Hove</A>&rsquo;. </P>
<P>This document was submitted as a joint bid by Brighton &amp; Hove City Council and the Brighton &amp; Hove Primary Care Trust to the DfES/DoH. </P>
<P>It details a proposal for the establishment of a Children&rsquo;s Trust for Brighton &amp; Hove, setting out the background, aims and shared objectives of the proposal, the long term vision, governance and accountability arrangements and a three-year plan of how the Trust will develop. Detailed examples of how the Trust would make a difference to the current service provision and listings of the services that it is envisaged the Trust would commission are also included. </P>
<P>Brighton &amp; Hove has subsequently been selected by the DfES/DoH as one of 25 pilot areas to take forward these proposals to the next stage and government funding has been made available to us for the further work involved. An important first step in the development of the Trust has been the appointment of a Children&rsquo;s Services Commissioner, James Dougan, who has made a good start on the ground work and consultative processes that need to be established to take this project forward. </P>
<P>Although both these documents are fairly lengthy and detailed, I would urge you to spend a few minutes reading them to gain a flavour of the vast scope of services we provide on a day-to-day basis and the many exciting projects that are planned for the future. You will see that a great number of our &lsquo;forward-thinking&rsquo; initiatives are in line with the recently published Green Paper, &lsquo;Every Child Matters&rsquo;, and the approach to children&rsquo;s services outlined is one that we, in Children, Families and School, welcome and fully embrace. </P>
<P>Yours sincerely, </P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>David Hawker, <BR>Director of Children, Families &amp; Schools.</P>
