		<h2>WHAT PEOPLE SAY ABOUT US</h2><p>As one of the UK's leading independent international art schools we are also one of the most popular and not just with students.  Each year over 22,000 visitors come to the GSA - tourists, friends, journalists, politicians, people from the creative industries, business people and the wider Glasgow community.  </p><p>Here is what they and our alumni and students say about us:</p><h2>THE WIDER COMMUNITY </h2><p><b>"The Glasgow School of Art is building a formidable international reputation"  </b>Tim Luckhurst, Sunday Times Scotland</p><p><b>"The GSA is an architecturally inspirational place: it has played a unique part in the history of design and continues to play a vital role in the future of the design industries." </b> Sir Terence Conran</p><p><b>"Glasgow has become Europe's leading city for young artists, bypassing London and challenging New York on the world stage."</b>  Philip Dodd, Director, Institute for Contemporary Arts, London</p><p><b>"Glasgow has lately become a downright fashionable place to be - the coolest city in the UK"</b>  Gary Krist, National Geographic Traveler Magazine</p><p><b>"The Mackintosh Building - one of the greatest achievements of all time, compared in scale and majesty to Michelongelo"</b>  Robert Venturi, Architect, Venturi, Scott Brown and Associates, Philadelphia</p><p><b>"To read a list of the graduate destinations of The Glasgow School of Art Textiles Department is like reading a who's who of the fashion world."</b>  Cog Magazine</p><p><b>"...in Glasgow, young architects make their Masters the fast way. A one year postgraduate course at the Mackintosh School is a springboard to an international career..."</b>  Alexander Gorlach, Journalist, 'Die Welt'</p><p><b>"Glasgow has been a centre of art for the last 100 years"</b>  Iain Gale, Scotland on Sunday</p><p><b>"It  is my opinion that The Glasgow School of Art is the greatest and most forward-looking building of its day on either side of the Atlantic." </b>Josef Konvitz, Head of Division, OECD, Paris</p><p><b>"I love the way Mackintosh finds a balance between Art Nouveau and the austerity of Japan."</b> George Melly, jazz musician and author</p><p><b>"...the only art school in the world where the building is worthy of the subject."</b>  Prof. Christopher Frayling, Rector - RCA</p><p><b>"...one of the most successful independent art schools in the country"</b>  The Scotsman Newspaper</p><h2>OUR ALUMNI AND GRADUATES</h2><p><b>"I learned to see at Glasgow. I learned to be liberal, compassionate, and a designer. The School gave me the gift of eternal optimism and an unshakable belief in human kind and the value of education... the place was outrageous, terrifying, excellent and above all, completely unlike any other."</b>  Janice Kirkpatrick, Founder and Designer, Graven Images (Graphic Design 1984)</p><p><b>"I was impressed with the great attention paid in GSA to classical disciplines like drawing, composition and colour which, at the same time, implemented the achievements made in 20 century art philosophy. But this wouldn't work at all, if not for our tutors. There are those who made us believe in ourselves and taught us to anlayse what we do. The atmosphere they created around themselves was penetrated with trust, which is a dominant factor in tutor-student productive relationship."</b>  Jacob Jugashvili, Director General, Caucasus.com Tbilisi, Russia (Drawing &amp; Painting, 1997)</p><p><b>"The Product Design Engineering course was an incredible preparation for working in the design consulting business. It was a great foundation for approaching any design problem, regardless of the area of expertise." </b> David Law, Speck Design, USA (Product Design Engineering 1991)</p><p><b>"It's got an amazing reputation and has produced amazingly talented people who have gone on to do amazing things so, undoubtedly, it has had a huge impact. Everyone has heard of its reputation - it doesn't matter where I am, if people find out where I studied they'll go 'wow' and tell me how incredible it must have been to have gone there."</b>  Nicola Becci, Jewellery Designer (Jewellery &amp; Silversmithing 1992)</p><p><b>"The School creates a highly competitive and challenging environment in which students thrive, producing work of striking originality in every field of expression."</b>  Alison Watt, Artist (Painting 1988)</p><p><b>"My time at The Glasgow School of Art was undoubtedly one of the most creative three years of my life, as I was allowed to perform to my fullest ability. Creativity was always encouraged, regardless of the subject matter." </b> Ian Callum, Director of Design, Jaguar Cars (Industrial Design 1977)</p><p><b>"The friendly and supportive academic environment of the School, the opportunity to visit Charles Rennie Mackintosh's building every day, and living in the beautiful City of Glasgow turned my three years research studies to a pleasant task I will always remember."</b>  Professor Mohsen Aboutrabi, Birmingham School of Architecture (Architecture 1986)</p><p><b>"So many great artists and designers have come from the GSA. I don't think their influence can be measured - but it can be seen, heard, tasted and felt in fashion houses, studios, galleries and workshops throughout the world."</b>  Innes Ferguson, Head of Design, Transport for London (Product Design 1996)</p><p><b>"The Art School is an excellent environment for developing your ideas and creativity. The studio atmosphere means you can benefit directly from the input of fellow students and staff."</b>  Neil McGuire, Founder and Designer, After the News (Visual Communications 2003)</p><p><b>"I studied at the Mac in the 80s. Since leaving I've been lucky enough to work and lecture all over the world. Wherever I have gone and mentioned my involvement with the School everyone is always hugely impressed. The global reputation of the School is founded on producing committed, well-read, talented designers with a practical approach to producing buildings of great distinction." </b>  Andy Bow, Director, Foster and Partners (Architecture 1987)</p><p><b>"Being a student at the Mackintosh School was a fantastic experience. I think it would be impossible to be there and not be imbued by Mackintosh's work; and the homogeneity of the City must also be a very powerful influence on anyone with architectural sensibilities. But its not for the fainthearted. The people know how to work and play hard!"</b>  Clare Wright, Wright and Wright Architects (Architecture 1978)</p><h2>OUR STUDENTS</h2><p><b>"My attendance at The Glasgow School of Art has been an enlightening experience to the international perspective towards art. The School gives students a global perception of art through the interweaving of the international student body. The experience of my three years in Glasgow has given me new eyes to the world of art."</b>  Andrew Mezvinsky, 3rd Year Painting</p><p><b>"My experience at The Glasgow School of Art has been fantastic. I have encountered above and beyond my expectations of challenges and opportunites necessary for developing as an artist. I don't want to go home...!!!"</b>  Elizabeth Alexander, 3rd Year Environmental Art</p><p><b>"The Mackintosh School of Architecture provides an open and friendly environment to learn through integration between all years, a personal and dedicated studio space and the opportunity to be involved with the activities and events of the rest of the Art School campus."</b>  Martin McCrae, 2nd Year Diploma, Mackintosh School of Architecture</p><p><b>"As a mature student I have been impressed at how both staff and students have made me feel so quickly at home. I am thoroughly enjoying myself and have found the projects set both challenging and stimulating. The last few months have been hectic but also great fun." </b> Mary Campbell, 4th Year Textiles</p><p><b>"The open-plan studio arrangement, where all the years are together, is a good place to learn from our peers. There is a good ethos in the School and the cafe bar beside the studios, run by the Mackintosh Architectural Students Society, is a real social hub where we can socialise and listen to lectures by invited architects". </b>Alison Fisher and Ashifa Dhalla, 3rd Year Class Representatives 2001-2</p><p><b>"I have learnt more in the past few weeks than in the final year of my course in the states." </b> Lisa Gadaleta, 1st Year MPhil 2D/3D Motion Graphics</p><p><b>"The International nature of the projects we have worked on reflects the worldwide opportunities open to us when we graduate after our Diploma year. Studying in Glasgow at the Mac gives a very broad experience ranging from the conceptual to delivering practical solutions to briefs - locally, nationally and internationally." </b>Alasdair Graham, 4th Year Student</p>
