<h2>Clean Assembly Area</h2>

<p>The clean assembly area is routinely qualified to Class 1000 and
utilises both horizontal and vertical air flows to maintain room
cleanliness. The assembly area is accessed from the <a
href="electronics.html">electronics services workshop</a>, with
the change area leading to a small anteroom adjacent to the main
cleanroom.  One end of the cleanroom (Fig&#160;1), is given over to a
wall-to-wall laminar flow bench qualified to Class 100. The room is
swept by the air passing through the HEPA filters of the flow bench,
while ceiling-mounted HEPA filter/fan units provide additional
protection to test facilities located in the four equipment bays. The
long laminar flow bench provides a large and convenient work area for
the integration of space hardware and cable assemblies, with all
movement of personnel occuring downstream from the work activity.</p>

<p>Two of the equipment bays are occupied by 1&#160;m diameter vacuum
vessels: the <a href="space_view_chamber.html">Space View Chamber
(SVC)</a> and the <a href="cold_optics_chamber.html">Cold Optics Chamber
(COC)</a>. A convenient and versatile support platform for infrared
test equipment is provided by an optical table placed between the two
chambers (Fig&#160;2). Infrared test signals may be directed into either
chamber, via windows, for the characterisation of space
instrumentation under mission-specific thermal vacuum conditions. The
third bay is occupied by a Mitutoyo co-ordinate measuring machine (Fig&#160;3). This is used for the inward inspection of machined parts and for
the integration of sub-assemblies where relative alignment is deemed
critical to performance.</p>

<p>The fourth bay is occupied by a third vacuum vessel known as the <a
href="thermal_cycling_chamber.html">Thermal Cycling Chamber
(TCC)</a>. This relatively new chamber will provide the capability to
carry out long-term thermal cycling of components and
sub-assemblies. As well as being used for general low temperature
testing, the TCC will have a short thermal time constant and be capable
of simulating the diurnal cycling on Mars throughout a typical Mars
lander mission.</p>
