    <h1 align="center">Funding for Home Graduate Students</h1>
    <p><b>Arts & Humanities Research Council Grants</b></p>
    <p> Funding for home and EU graduate students normally comes from the <a href="http://www.ahrb.ac.uk/">Arts 
      and Humanities Research Council</a>. The AHRC offers two sorts of grant: 
      one year awards for M.Phil. courses and the like ('Research Preparation 
      Master's Scheme') and three year awards for the Ph.D. ('Doctoral Awards 
      Scheme'). The advice contained on this page applies to both types of award. 
      Awards cover both fees and maintenance. The deadline for applications for 
      both types of award is <strong>May 1st</strong>. This is an absolute deadline, 
      and the AHRC will not consider any application after that date. You need 
      to have already been accepted for your proposed course <b>before</b> you 
      apply to the AHRC. That means that you should apply promptly for your chosen 
      course, and that you would be well advised to apply to several institutions 
      at the same time. If you wait until you have heard from one institution 
      before you apply to another you could find that the whole process draws 
      on beyond the AHRC deadline. </p>
    <h1 align="center" class="style1">The deadline for AHRC applications to reach the Faculty is Monday, 
      March 26th </h1>
    <p>The AHRC is very keen that students should normally do an M.Phil. or similar 
      course before they proceed to the Ph.D. The reason for this is that experience 
      has shown that students who have had proper training in research methods 
      are more likely to complete their Ph.D. dissertations promptly. The practical 
      consequences of this policy is that the AHRC almost always only gives three 
      year grants to students who already have completed an M.Phil. course or 
      equivalent. You should bear this fact in mind when you decide which course 
      you should apply for. If you have not already obtained an M.Phil. qualification 
      or equivalent and your interests lie in an area in which the Faculty does 
      not offer an M.Phil. course (such as twentieth century British poetry) it 
      may be in your interests to consider taking a one year course at another 
      institution before you apply for a Ph.D. here.</p>
    <p>The AHRC's criteria for awarding grants are: </p>
    <ul>
      <li>That your research proposal promises to make a contribution to knowledge 
        and is sufficiently self-contained to be completed within the period of 
        your course. (For this reason your proposal should clearly say how you 
        plan to go beyond the existing state of knowledge in your proposed subject 
        area, and you should give clear conceptual, generic or chronological limits 
        to the materials you propose to cover); </li>
      <li>Your qualifications for the proposed course. (Your topic should ideally 
        be related to your choice of options as an undergraduate, or to the subject 
        areas in which your undergraduate performance so far has been strongest);</li>
      <li>The suitability of the institution at which you wish to study to the 
        topic which you propose. (It is a good idea to mention in your proposal 
        the holdings of the University Library in your proposed area or the presence 
        in Cambridge of a particular supervisor with whom you wish to work).</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The Faculty also takes account of all these criteria when it comes to assess 
      applications, so it is well worth giving serious thought to your proposal, 
      even if you are applying for an M.Phil. course. <a href="../faculty/index.htm">Members 
      of the Faculty</a> may be willing to give advice on how best to present 
      your proposal.</p>
    <p>The AHRC is very keen to ensure that rates of submission of Ph.D.s remain 
      at an acceptable level. They have recently stated that any institution in 
      which submission rates among AHRC funded students fall below 50% will be 
      blacklisted. This means that those institutions will not be allowed to have 
      any AHRC funded students for two years. The Faculty is consequently extremely 
      keen to ensure that all AHRC funded students submit work to their supervisors 
      regularly, and that they remain on course to submit their dissertations 
      within three years. This makes it particularly important to devise an area 
      of study which can be completed swiftly.</p>
    <p><i>Application forms are usually available from the AHRC website <a href="http://www.ahrc.ac.uk"> 
      www.ahrc.ac.uk</a> from January </i></p>
    <p> <b>Domestic Research Studentships</b> </p>
    <p>To be eligible for a <a href="http://www.admin.cam.ac.uk/univ/gsprospectus/funding/funding.html">Domestic 
      Research Studentship</a> you must be registered as &#8220;PhD&#8221;, &#8220;Not 
      at First Registered&#8221; or &#8220;CPGS&#8221; when the award commences, 
      i.e. during the academic year 2007-6 and you must also have applied to the 
      AHRC. All students who are eligible will automatically be put forward for 
      this award so there are no separate forms to fill in.</p>
    <p>Further details of <a href="http://www.admin.cam.ac.uk/univ/gsprospectus/funding/">Costs 
      and Sources of Funding</a> for graduate students are listed in the graduate 
      prospectus.</p>
