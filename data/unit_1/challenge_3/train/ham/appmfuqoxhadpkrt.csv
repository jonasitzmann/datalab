<H1 class=page>MORSE v3</h1>
<H6>13SEP05</H6>
<HR>
MORSE v3 is officially available from September 2005.
It does everything MORSE v2 does, but also
<UL>
<LI> Uses the new <a
href=http://www.atm.ox.ac.uk/group/mipas/L1C/index.html#v2.0>L1C 
format (v2.0)</a> input files to tell MORSE
things like type of spectrum, spectral resolution and nominal altitudes
rather than have to enter these in the driver table via Flags and the
*SCN section. 

<LI> Allows retrievals on different grids: not just tangent levels but
also (<font color=red>although these haven't yet been tested!</font>) 
pressure and altitude surfaces. 
Also allows species to be retrieved
simultaneously on different subsets of the same grid.

<LI> Creates new output files <b>morse.swp</b> which 
contain data previously included in <b>morse.rtv</b> and <b>morse.atm</b>
that was fundamentally associated with the tangent point of the spectrum 
(=sweep), such as adjusted altitudes
and chisq statistics. This is related to the decoupling of tangent points
and retrieval levels.
</ul>

As far as the v2 user is concerned, the following changes are required.
<OL>
<LI> The L1C data has to be 
generated in the new format by running the new 
<a href=l1c.html>l1c.pro</a> program 
<LI> The MORSE driver tables have to be restructured:
instead of sections arranged as on the left, they
are now arranged as on the right, with the *SCN section deleted and the
*LEV section relabelled as *TAN.

</TABLE>

<LI> The output <b>morse.swp</b> file from the pT retrieval should be
inserted into the *L1C section immediately after the L1C filename - this
is now how the sweep altitudes are modified rather than via the *L2P section.

<LI> The NOM and HYD flags are no longer used.
The NOM flag is now effectively always applied while the hydrostatic constraint
is applied whenever both temperature and pressure/pointing are retrieved.
