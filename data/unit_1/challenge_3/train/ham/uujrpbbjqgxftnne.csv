		<h2>POSTGRADUATE STUDIES</h2><h2>POSTGRADUATE STUDIES + RESEARCH</h2><p>At the GSA we see postgraduate study as a natural progression for the committed artist, designer or architect determined to make their way in professional practice and research. </p><p>where better to do this than Glasgow - home to the UK's largest number of creative industries outside London - a creative community which is internationally focused and globally referenced.</p><p>The community you become part of here will last you a lifetime.</p><h2>WELCOME</h2><p>The GSA has one of the UK's largest research communities in the creative arts outside London. This is partly thanks to the skill and dedication of staff and students alike; but it is also largely thanks to the ambition of the School.</p><p>In recent years, the postgraduate and research community has grown considerably and now comprises over 150 PhD and masters students; and it is set to expand further over the next few years with the development of new programmes and pathways offering an increased range of options for postgraduate study at masters and doctoral level. </p><p>But this only hints at the breadth and depth of the opportunities available to postgraduates. Our taught masters programme, for example, offers study in everything from fine art to 3D motion graphics; our research programme brings to life the very latest in creative thinking.</p><p>I came to the GSA to be challenged: and to challenge others. The study programmes here are among the very best available internationally. For me, the real excitement is the commitment the School has made to postgraduate study, and the opportunities for students to become involved in research and to work with professional artists, designers and architects. Here, postgraduate study is central to the School's strategic development.</p><p>In a sector that is placing increasing importance on training and independent creative thinking, the GSA offers postgraduate students wonderful opportunities for development, both personally and in their careers. Glasgow itself plays a vital role in all of this. This is a wonderfully creative city. Study at the GSA and you'll be at the heart of it all.</p><p>Dr Naren Barfield <br />CertAD DipFA BA (Hons) MA <br />PhD PGCert ILTM<br />Head of Research and Postgraduate Studies</p><h2>STUDYING AT POSTGRADUATE LEVEL AT THE GSA</h2><p>Research and postgraduate study at the GSA seeks to integrate the highest levels of practice-led, studio-based and theoretical approaches, providing opportunities for ambitious students to build on previous undergraduate or professional experience and to reflect on and develop personal practice. Through working within a highly focused community framework students develop the necessary confidence and independence to proceed into a range of careers - fashion, textiles, design, architecture - or the path of a practicing artist.</p><p>The ethos of the GSA is all about becoming a motivated and independent creative thinker and practitioner within today's international arena. The place of the research community within this vision is central. Research at the school is outward facing - in other words we encourage our undergraduates and postgraduates to connect actively with the processes and outcomes of visual research. </p><p>Each programme is fully immersed in contemporary practice leading to a rich variety of careers and destinations for our students, including:</p><ul><li>Professional practice - working as an artist, designer, architect, historian or theorist - in the world</li><li>Working within, or connected to, the creative and wider industries</li><li>Further research at doctoral level, with opportunities for postdoctoral research</li></ul><p>At GSA we use a range of learning and teaching strategies including formal lectures, seminars, workshops, groups crits, individual and small group tutorials and student-led peer review sessions. In addition, students lead a twice-termly Postgraduate Forum. These events enable all students on masters and doctoral programmes to meet, socialise and discuss areas of common interest. Students are able to invite external speakers to present their research and practice, and staff and students from external partners including the Royal Scottish Academy of Music and Drama and Glasgow University are also invited to participate.</p><p>The Scottish education system is highly regarded throughout the world. On our postgraduate programmes a range of assessment methods is used, such as exhibited creative work (including fashion catwalks), portfolios, research logs (eg. sketch books, blogs, notebooks) and written material (essays, dissertations and theses). Additionally, for research masters and doctoral students, we are able to offer a high level of support from a significant number of staff who are qualified to supervise to PhD level.</p><p>Research is pivotal in the creative development of the GSA. It is the sphere in which staff and students share and exchange ideas, knowledge and interests. There is an incredible dynamism in the school at this level and you will be joining one of the most active, vibrant research communities in architecture, fine art and design in the UK. In 2001 the GSA was ranked as the UK's second largest research community in art and design, outside London. Since then we've been investing further in our infrastructure, creating a community of established and emerging researchers focused around eight research centres and a number of more fluid, themed research clusters, while continuing to support excellent individual researchers.</p><p>We are in the process of creating one of the most exciting creative research communities in the UK with opportunities for doctoral study and growing links with taught masters programmes. We work within an international context, with a range of partnerships and joint initiatives with prestigious arts institutions worldwide. </p><p>Our research and postgraduate programmes attract students from around the world who are seeking to become part of an international network of creative practitioners. As a postgraduate research or masters student at the GSA you will have a high degree of flexibility, choice and control over your own learning. Additionally we see regular interaction with staff as key to your creative development and our programme structures involve a high level of peer review and critical reflection, which are essential components to working within a research community.</p><p>In short, what we offer is a tremendous opportunity:</p><ul><li>To develop within a dynamic research community</li><li>To choose from a range of options at postgraduate level</li><li>To interact with staff at the forefront of international practice and research</li><li>To work alongside some of the highest calibre students from across the world</li><li>To make contacts that can lead to developing international networks</li><li>To take part in inter-disciplinary projects</li><li>To participate in international exchanges</li><li>To gain knowledge and experience for a career in professional practice, research or industry</li></ul><p>We offer this within an incomparable environment: the GSA has been described by Sir Christopher Frayling, Rector of the Royal College of Art, as 'The only art school in the world where the building is worthy of the subject.' As for Glasgow itself - it is architecturally distinctive, stylish, self-confident, stimulating, famous for its friendliness and is a hub for all the creative industries.</p><h2>RESEARCH STAFF</h2><p>Dr Nicky Bird (subject to confirmation)<br />BA (Hons) MA PhD<br />PhD Coordinator: School of Design, <br />Fine Art and Historical and Critical Studies<br />Linda Brady<br />MSc FIBMS CSci MRSC CCHEM<br />Research Developer and PhD Coordinator: Digital Design Studio<br />Laura Gonzalez <br />Licenciada (Spain), MA, PgCert<br />Research Degrees Coordinator: <br />The Glasgow School of Art<br />Dr Tim Sharpe <br />BSc BArch PhD ARIAS <br />Research Developer and PhD Coordinator: the Mackintosh School of Architecture<br />Dr Damian Sutton<br />BA (Hons) MA PhD<br />Research Developer: School of Design, <br />Fine Art and Historical and Critical Studies</p><h2>SENIOR RESEARCHERS</h2><p>Professor Colin Porteous<br />DA MPhil PhD ARIAS<br />Senior Researcher, Mackintosh <br />School of Architecture<br />Professor Alastair Macdonald<br />AGSA FRSA ILTM<br />Senior Researcher, School of Design<br />Professor Thomas Joshua Cooper<br />BA MA<br />Senior Researcher, School of Fine Art</p><h2>CAREERS + ALUMNI</h2><p>Graduates of the GSA's taught masters and research programmes go on to a range of careers within the creative sectors, continue with academic research, or use their creative education as a springboard into a wider business sphere.</p><ul><li>Claire Barclay Master of Fine Art, 1993 Artist</li><li>Russell BaxterMArch, 1990 Associate at Davis Duncan Architects</li><li>Minty Donald 2D/3D Motion Graphics, 2003 AHRC Research Fellow</li><li>Alan Dunlop PGDip Architecture, 1985 Founder Murray Dunlop Architects</li><li>Chloe Highmore MDes Textiles as Fashion, 2005 Designer</li><li>Gareth Hoskins MArch, 1991 Architect</li><li>Nathan Isley MArch, 1992 President Isley Hawkins Architecture</li><li>Janice Kirkpatrick Master of Design, 1985 Founder, Graven Images design practice</li><li>Adonis Kotzias MPhil 2D/3D Motion Graphics, 2000 Senior Shader/Texture Artist Animal Logic </li><li>Yukike Nagamine MDes Textiles as Fashion, 2004 Designer</li><li>Rosalind Nashashibi Master of Fine Art, 2000 Artist, winner Beck's Future Prize 2003</li><li>Julie Roberts Master of Fine Art, 1994 Artist</li><li>Kendra Roberts MDes Silversmithing  + Jewellery, 2000 Jewellery Designer</li><li>Gaylie Runciman, Debs Norton, Moyra Campbell MPhil 2D/3D Motion Graphics, 2002</li><li>Founders rm* digital animation for public space</li><li>Simon Starling Master of Fine Art, 1992 Artist, winner Turner Prize 2005</li><li>Noah Saterstrom Master of Fine Arts, 2001 Artist/painter and teacher at Warren Wilson College, North Carolina.</li><li>Jeanne Tan PhD Fashion Textiles, 2005 Assistant Professor Hong Kong Polytechnic University</li><li>Alison Watt PG Dip Drawing &amp; Painting, 1998 Artist, first woman to have a solo exhibition at Scottish National Gallery, exhibiting at The National Gallery, London in 2008</li></ul><p><b>Minty Donald 2D/3D Motion Graphics, 2003</b><br />Minty, artist working with projected imagery, sound, performance and site, holds an AHRC Fellowship in the Creative and Performing Arts, based at The Glasgow School of Art's Mackintosh School of Architecture.

Much of this material is unique and irreplaceable.</p><p>The Mackintosh Collection comprises almost 300 works by the School's most famous alumnus, Charles Rennie Mackintosh. Equally important is the non-Mackintosh Collection, which contains work by other former staff and students reflecting changing attitudes to the visual arts, design and the built environment over the past 160 years.</p><p>Work from the varied collections is used regularly to support local, national and international exhibitions.</p><h2>INTERNATIONAL DRAWING RESEARCH INSTITUTE</h2><p><b>Centre Contact</b><br />Dr Naren Barfield <br />CertAD DipFA BA (Hons) MA PhD PGCert ILTM</p><p>Research and postgraduate study within an international context is a key strength of the GSA. The Institute is an international collaboration between the School, the College of Fine Art at the University of New South Wales in Sydney, and the Central Academy of Fine Arts in Beijing. Its aim is to explore drawing practices across different cultures throughout the world.</p><p>Through a range of innovative projects and activities including exhibitions, publications, conferences and, most importantly, staff and student exchanges, the Institute seeks to broaden understanding of diverse cultural and creative practice.</p><h2>STUDIO 55</h2><p><b>Centre Contact</b><br />Professor Klaus Jung</p><p>Studio 55 is dedicated to providing a sustainable infrastructure for the development of new knowledge, projects and discourse in practice-led research in fine art. It seeks to situate fine art practice at the GSA within a global context and to communicate this research to the wider academic and professional art world.</p><p>Studio 55 aims to:</p><ul><li>Support individual and collaborative research in fine art practice</li><li>Co-ordinate and document the development of researchers and facilitate cross-disciplinary and interdisciplinary discourse </li><li>Create an environment in which researchers can seek advice, feedback and support in all aspects of research </li><li>Create an archive and bibliographical resource of publications on practice-led and practice-based research to support researchers in addressing theories and methods of fine art research</li><li>Support the dissemination and evaluation of research through facilitating exhibitions, symposia, conferences and publications </li><li>Create an international peer network of artists and academics to maintain and develop high quality research</li></ul><h2>CENTRE FOR ART IN SOCIAL CONTEXTS</h2><p><b>Centre Contact</b><br />Tanya Eccleston<br />BA MA</p><p>The Centre undertakes research that furthers understanding and knowledge of art generated through, or situated in, the context of the social and public realm. Contemporary art making often includes working with spaces, communities, institutions and audiences outside the conventional gallery or exhibition context. </p><p>Artists are initiating projects and ways of engaging with social contexts that are interdisciplinary, diverse and distinctive and yet opportunities are often limited by a narrow, conventional view of art and artists. </p><p>The Centre, which has developed from the staff expertise and interests of the School of Fine Art, is committed to creating new opportunities for, and greater understanding of, contemporary art practice in the public realm. It is currently undertaking research for the Scottish Arts Council, helping to establish Scotland's new Public Art Resource as a key resource for artists, stakeholders and communities across the UK.</p><h2>CENTRE FOR CREATIVE EDUCATION</h2><p><b>Centre Contact</b><br />Professor Allan Walker<br />MA(Oxon) DipLI</p><p>Creativity and creative education underpin the GSA's rationale, informing and giving vitality to research, learning and teaching. An important aspect of the Centre's work is to identify and analyse the nature of creativity - particularly in our subject areas - and examine the extent to which it may be transferable beyond the creative disciplines.</p><p>Engendering, encouraging, managing and disseminating creativity is of consuming interest to a society in which innovation and imagination are essential to progress. In understanding 'creativity' there is thus a pure research dimension; but the application of creativity involves applied research and knowledge transfer. These two elements inform the work of the Centre. This major area of research is interdisciplinary, incorporating pedagogy in art, design, media and architecture which in turn informs the development of the academic programme.</p><p>Three clusters of research activity are:</p><ul><li>The nature of creativity</li><li>Creativity as a form of knowledge transfer</li><li>Pedagogic research into creativity</li></ul><h2>RESEARCH CLUSTERS</h2><p>At the next level after our Research Centres, areas of activity are grouped into themes, or Clusters, which enable researchers in cognate fields to explore ideas and subjects ranging from 'blue-skies' and short-life projects through to strategic research developments. Research Clusters enable flexible and rapid progress of research themes which are responsive to innovation and speculation, collaboration, and internally and externally generated research opportunities. They reflect staff interests and support the development of knowledge and understanding across the School's range of expertise.</p><p>Examples of current clusters include:</p><p>School of Fine Art</p><ul><li>Discourse, linked to a research initiative investigating dialogue and communication as well as dissonance and dispute </li><li>Drawing, as a tool for thinking within and about Fine Art process</li><li>Topics relating to the fields of specialism: painting and printmaking, fine art photography, sculpture and environmental art</li></ul><p>School of Design</p><ul><li>Design and creativity: imagination and the design sensibility</li><li>Design for social innovation: health, wellbeing and the environment</li><li>Design for technology: systems of interconnectivity which link communities together</li><li>Narratology and digital media</li><li>Topics in design specialisms including textiles, jewellery and visual communication</li><li>Universal design and design for dementia</li></ul><p>Digital Design Studio</p><ul><li>Development, application and evaluation of advanced digital visualisation techniques for fine art, design and architecture</li><li>2D/3D motion graphics and virtual prototyping for fine art, design and architecture</li></ul><p>Mackintosh School of Architecture </p><ul><li>Visual Cities: the application of advanced real-time three-dimensional simulation of sensory environments to problems of urban design and architecture</li><li>The Archive of drawings donated to the school by the seminal Scottish practice of Gillespie, Kidd and Coia provides a research resource for publication and exhibition</li><li>Living Cities: how urban territories are constructed, managed, used and experienced</li></ul><p>Historical and Critical studies</p><ul><li>History and Theory of Photography</li><li>Art in the Public Sphere</li><li>Contemporary Scottish Art Practice</li><li>Contemporary Art Criticism</li><li>History of Scottish Sculpture</li><li>History and Theory of popular Design</li><li>Social Theory</li><li>Photography and Film</li><li>Destruction and Catastrophe in Art</li><li>Art Education Theory and Practice</li></ul><h2>DOCTOR OF PHILOSOPHY</h2><h2>PHD </h2><h2>MASTER OF PHILOSOPHY</h2><h2>MPHIL</h2><p><b>Research Degrees Coordinator</b><br />Laura Gonzalez<br />Licenciada (Spain), <br />MA, PgCert</p><p>Research Degree programmes are available in Architecture, Fine Art, Design, Digital Design and Historical and Critical Studies; and interdisciplinary projects within the School's supervisory capacity. The GSA also welcomes proposals that promote collaboration across academic boundaries in conjunction with partner institutions, including the University of Glasgow.</p><p>We offer both full-time and part-time modes of Research Degree study. Completion of the PhD programme normally takes a minimum of three years full-time, or five years part-time. Students are able to choose, according to their individual programme of research, a mode of submission that best articulates their original contribution to knowledge. This may include a wide range of visual and textual elements, which may be in physical and/or digital formats.</p><p>All postgraduate research students enrol with both the GSA and the University of Glasgow and have access to facilities in both campuses. The GSA will aim to support candidates applying for a Doctoral Award from the Arts and Humanities Research Council, other UK research councils, or, <br />in the case of international students, the Overseas Research Student Awards Scheme (ORSAS) or government scholarships. From time to time, a limited number of studentships attached to one of the GSA Research Centres may be advertised nationally, inviting applicants to research specific areas of art, design and/or architecture. </p><p>We welcome applications, in particular, from graduates in possession of a taught masters degree, and also accept applications from candidates with a first class or upper second class honours degree in a field relevant to the proposed area of study. The GSA will also consider applications from candidates with a relevant professional background. Applicants are invited to seek advice from the School's Research Degrees Coordinator to determine the suitability of the programme and to develop their application.</p><h2>MASTER OF FINE ART</h2><h2>MFA</h2><p><b>Programme Leader</b><br />Sam Ainsley <br />BA (Hons) PgDip<br />(to August 2006)</p><p>Since 1988 the GSA MFA programme has built an international reputation as one of the UK's leading programmes in postgraduate fine art. The programme enables students to develop towards careers as professional artists, and offers a grounding for candidates seeking to progress to research degree study. Students on the MFA are able to develop knowledge and understanding in a practice-led research environment, within a community of artists and academics of international standing. </p><p>It offers the opportunity critically to develop work in a rigorous yet supportive environment and to gain the intellectual, practical and interpersonal skills needed for a career as a professional artist. In 2002 the GSA became the only European Art School to be accepted into the Matching Partners Fellowship scheme for the prestigious Skowhegan Summer School in Maine, USA, an intensive nine-week residency programme for emergent visual artists. </p><p>MFA graduates have achieved international success as practicing artists. Such artists as Simon Starling, Bryndis Snaebjornsdottir, Louise Hopkins, Satoshi Watanabe and Shauna McMullan have put Glasgow at the forefront of the contemporary international art world.</p><h2>MASTERS IN 2D/3D </h2><h2>MOTION GRAPHICS</h2><h2>MPHIL</h2><p>This two year masters programme focuses on the creation of imaginative, well crafted digital animation. In year one, students develop high levels of proficiency in animation, story telling, scriptwriting, storyboarding, modelling, rendering, sound construction, compositing and editing. This is contextualised through a series of lectures looking at film and film language.  </p><p>In year two, these skills are used to write, build and direct a personal animation project. The aim is to develop imaginative animators who are distinctive in the market place. Students benefit from a highly hands-on approach <br />to teaching, a well resourced learning environment and dedicated workstations. They work alongside current research developments in 3D visualisation technologies and interface design. The department is augmented by a growing number of doctoral students.</p><p>Applications are invited from graduates from a wide range of backgrounds: science, social science and engineering as well as art and design. Prior experience in animation is not required however those with experience in computer animation may go directly into year two.</p><h2>MASTERS IN DESIGN PRACTICE</h2><h2>MDES TEXTILES AS FASHION</h2><p><b>Programme Leader</b><br />Jimmy Stephen-Cran <br />BA (Hons) MA </p><p>The MDes in Textiles as Fashion is an advanced skills postgraduate programme designed to meet the ambitions of textile design graduates who wish to inspire and assert fashion from textiles-outward rather than silhouette-inward.</p><p>The rationale for the programme is the increasing visibility of textile design graduates in the fashion industry and how they are beginning to enjoy the same recognition once reserved for 'orthodox' fashion graduates. Designers such as Matthew Williamson, Eley Kishimoto, Julien MacDonald and, more recently, Jonathan Saunders - all textile graduates -are helping dispel the notion that textile design and fashion design are separate activities within the same industry.</p><p>This unique programme is aimed primarily at motivated textile graduates who wish to extend their design handwriting by developing and resolving their textiles as either fashion or accessory products. It is not a conversion course intended to retrain textile designers as fashion designers, but sets out <br />to produce visionary designers who work through embroidery, print, weave or decoration to create fashion.</p><h2>MASTERS IN ART, DESIGN + ARCHITECTURE IN EDUCATION</h2><h2>MA</h2><p><b>Programme leader</b><br />Jane Allan<br />MA (Hons) PgDip<br />(to August 2006)</p><p>Delivered jointly by The Glasgow School of Art (GSA) and The School of Education at The University of Glasgow (GU), this programme has a flexible mode of delivery. It can be completed full-time, fast-track, in one calendar year (September to September), full-time over four terms with a summer break, or over three years (part-time). The programme is designed to cater to the needs of working professionals or those who are undertaking work-based study, and all formal classes are held either in the early evening or at the weekend. It is also possible to build up credit by undertaking one-off individual programmes.</p><p>The programme consists of eight taught courses: <br />Drawing, Environment, Creative Processes, New Media in <br />Arts Education, Methods of Educational Research I, Methods of Educational Research II, Contemporary Issues in Education, The Arts in Education plus a research component which is the equivalent of four taught programmes.</p><p>Research projects generated as part of the programme have been remarkably diverse not least because students are encouraged to produce artefacts with accompanying rationales as well as traditional dissertations. Recent research has focused on a wide range of topics including: Creativity in Kuwaiti secondary schools; the role of the senses in Built Environment Education; and the visual language of special needs creative education. A very recent research artefact came in the form of a school bag with a range of ingeniously designed contents intended to explore the concept of reflexivity in CPD for teachers.</p><h2>MASTER OF ARCHITECTURE </h2><h2>TAUGHT</h2><h2>MARCH</h2><p><b>Programme leader</b><br />Alexander Page<br />DipArch ARIAS</p><p>The programme is research and project driven with multi-disciplinary input in the areas of Urban Design and Creative Urban Practices, Urban Building, Computer Aided Architectural Design, and Energy and Environmental Studies. </p><p>The programme begins with a series of core lectures and seminars, balanced by focused reading of key literature related to the four areas of enquiry. This enables all of the students on the programme to gain a multi-disciplinary perspective and provides ground for shared discourse.</p><p>The Core Lectures and Seminars form the background and basis for the preparation of two research papers and for the individual project. These Core Lectures and Seminars are:</p><ul><li>Research Theory and Methodology </li><li>The City as Glasgow </li><li>Urban Design and Creative Urban Practices </li><li>Urban Building </li><li>Computer Aided Architectural Design </li><li>Energy &amp; Environmental Studies </li></ul><h2>MASTERS IN RESEARCH </h2><h2>MRES (CREATIVE PRACTICES)</h2><p><b>Programme Coordinator</b><br />Laura Gonzalez<br />Licenciada (Spain), <br />MA, PgCert</p><p>A cross-GSA initiative, this 45 week intensive programme focuses on developing the understanding and capabilities of students in architecture, design, digital design, fine art, and historical and critical studies to undertake substantial further research including doctoral study. It also offers a research experience in its own right that will enable graduates to apply new knowledge in a range of professional contexts.</p><p>Students will be supported to develop skills and contexts for research, critical judgment and academic competencies, including the ability to devise and manage a research project. They will have the opportunity to explore their research interests and develop a grasp of current research issues in their chosen field, a range of related creative disciplines and/or other areas relevant to their research.</p><p>The programme is intended as both a preparation for a research degree and a standalone award that enables students to acquire professional competencies in research at a level appropriate to masters degree study. It has been devised for graduates with maturity, focus and independence. We will support students in making research degree applications and enhancing proposals that require development for direct entry onto a research degree programme.</p><p>This programme is subject to approval by Senate.</p>
