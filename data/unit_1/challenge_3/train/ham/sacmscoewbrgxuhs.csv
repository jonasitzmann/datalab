<p>Wind data are summarised on a rose diagram showing the distribution of winds according to their speed (m/s) and direction. Wind records are grouped by direction into 22.5Â° circular segments each with radius (length) corresponding to the number of wind records in the segment (expressed as a percentage of the 365 daily observations represented). Wind speeds are categorised according to the 'Key' (lower right-hand scale) and the proportion of all records of each speed occurring within each segment are denoted using the appropriate colours.</p>
