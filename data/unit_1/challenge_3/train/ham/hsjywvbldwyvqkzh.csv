Abstract:
</H4>

<p>
We are interested by instability modes of the flow induced by a differential rotation and a radial temperature gradient in a vertical cylindrical annulus with a large aspect ratio. The first instability mode appears in the form of helicoidal vortices called spirals. The stability of these vortices is investigated depending on the control parameters. Recent experimental and numerical results will be presented.
