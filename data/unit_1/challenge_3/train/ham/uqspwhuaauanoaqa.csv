<H3><A HREF="http://www.atm.ox.ac.uk/hirdls">HIRDLS</A> - High-Resolution InfraRed Dynamics Limb Sounder</H3>

High-Resolution InfraRed Dynamics Limb Sounder</H3>
This is an advanced new instrument that was launched on the AURA
satellite, part of NASA's `Earth Observing System', in July 2004.
It will measure stratospheric and mesospheric temperature and composition 
at unprecedentedly high spatial resolution, revealing processes that are 
virtually unobservable by current satellite instruments. AOPP has a major 
role in its design and construction, including responsibility for its 
calibration, flight operations and scientific objectives.  We are also
team members for a large American experiment, the Tropospheric Emission 
Spectrometer, on the same spacecraft. TES has similar goals to HIRDLS and 
we plan to undertake joint scientific data analysis.

<H3> <A HREF="http://www.atm.ox.ac.uk/group/mipas/">MIPAS</a> -
Michelson Interferometer for Passive Atmospheric Sounding </h3>

MIPAS is one of the core experiments now flying on ESA's Envisat satellite.
It measures atmospheric limb emission spectra from which profiles of
atmospheric temperature and composition can be obtained, using an
operational retrieval scheme developed in part at Oxford.  AOPP is also an
`Expert Support Laboratory', working with other European laboratories to
validate the new MIPAS data and use it to develop science products.

<H3> <A HREF="http://www-atm.physics.ox.ac.uk/group/isams/"> ISAMS </A> - Improved Stratospheric and Mesospheric Sounder</H3>
This sophisticated infrared radiometer measured temperature and trace
chemical profiles in the stratosphere and mesosphere, using the `pressure
modulation radiometry' technique that was developed here in the 1970s and
used on several previous space instruments. We designed, built and tested
ISAMS in collaboration with the Rutherford Appleton Laboratory and British
Aerospace; it was launched on NASA's Upper Atmosphere Research Satellite in
1991. The data analysis programme involves the study of physical processes
in the stratosphere and mesosphere, including those responsible for changes
in the ozone layer.

<H3><A HREF="http://www.atm.ox.ac.uk/group/mopitt/index.html">MOPITT</A> - Measurements Of Pollution In The Troposphere</H3>
MOPITT was developed by the University of Toronto, with substantial design
and hardware contributions from Oxford, and successfully launched on
December 18 1999 onboard the Terra satellite. It measures the global budgets
of carbon monoxide and methane in the troposphere, and data analysis is now
underway, in tandem with that for an aircraft version of MOPITT also
developed in collaboration with groups in Canada and the USA.

<H3>Long-term Climate Data from Space Instruments </H3>
Oxford was a pioneer in the development of satellite instruments for
atmospheric and climate observations, with the first to be designed and
built in AOPP launched on NASA's Nimbus 4 weather satellite in 1970.  Three
others followed in the same decade.  Together with later instruments they
have contributed to an archive on temperatures and constituent
concentrations throughout the middle atmosphere, now held at the
<A HREF="http://www.badc.rl.ac.uk">British Atmospheric Data Centre.</A>, which, because of its long baseline in time, is of
interest for the detection and study of global change.

<P><A NAME="intro"><H3>Introduction</H3></A>
<TABLE WIDTH=100%><TR><TD><IMG SRC="Halley.png"></TD><TD VALIGN=TOP>
<P>Modern planetary science at Oxford can be traced back to the work
of Edmund Halley (1656-1742), who, in addition to being a pioneering
geophysicist and oceanographer, made observations of Mars, Venus, and
Mercury, as well as his famous studies of the orbits of comets.

<P>Today we are involved in instrumentation, analysis and modelling in
connection with European and American space missions to all of the
planets known in Halley's time. This research is supported by a
consolidated rolling grant from the Particle Physics and Astronomy
Research Council.
</TD></TR></TABLE>

<P><A NAME="mercury"><H3>Mercury</H3></A>
<TABLE WIDTH=100%><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP>
<P>A study has shown the importance of making infrared measurements of
Mercury from the Planetary Orbiter component of the forthcoming
European BepiColombo mission.  These can be used to study the heat
flux from the interior, the physical properties of different regions
on the surface of the planet, the condensate deposits at the poles and
their relationship to the tenuous atmosphere. Suitable instrumentation
is being developed as the basis for a flight proposal.

<BR><I>Deep cloud structure on Venus imaged at a wavelength of 2.3 microns

<P>Part of the payload of the first artificial satellite of Venus -
Pioneer Venus Orbiter in 1979 - was built at Oxford.  Data analysis
from this instrument, the Venus Orbiter Radiometric Temperature
Sounding Experiment (VORTEX), is still being analysed, in
collaboration with colleagues who made similar observations from the
VENERA series of Venus probes. Oxford scientists were also part of the
team that observed Venus with the NIMS instrument on the Galileo
spacecraft in 1991.
<P>More recently, we have worked with American, Japanese and European
groups to develop new opportunities for investigating Venus, and its
deep, hot atmosphere and mysterious dynamics.  The Japanese mission
has now been approved, and looks likely to be followed by Venus
Express, a European mission scheduled for launch in 2005.  We retain
an interest in these projects at Oxford, and a general circulation
model of Venus's atmosphere is also being developed (q.v.).

<P>In terms of the scientific goals, and the experimental and theoretical
techniques employed, there is a lot of commonality between the
extensive programme of Earth Observation at Oxford and our studies of
the other planets with atmospheres.  The planetary system formed and
evolved as a family, and its common origin may be traced through
comparative planetology.  It is also the case that studies of, for
example, the greenhouse effect on Venus, giant eddies on Jupiter and
water vapour on Mars can shed light on the analogous terrestrial
climate-related processes.

<BR><I>Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter, 2005</I></TD><TD VALIGN=TOP>
<P>The Department's third space mission to Mars in collaboration
with colleagues in the USA, is scheduled for launch in 2005, and the
flight hardware is presently under construction. A sophisticated
general circulation model of Mars' atmosphere has been developed
with colleagues in France and Spain over an extended period and is now
the most advanced in the world.  Space experiment data on atmospheric
temperature, composition and dust loading can be directly assimilated
into the model, allowing diagnostics and even forecasts to be made
using similar methods to terrestrial meteorology.
<P>Instruments to be operated on the surface of Mars include the wind
sensor on the Beagle 2 lander, and the meteorological experiment on
the network of surface stations (NetLander) to be deployed in 2007.
</TD></TR></TABLE>

<P><A NAME="jupiter"><H3>Jupiter</H3></A>
<TABLE WIDTH=100%><TD VALIGN=TOP>
<P> Oxford scientists helped to develop the Near Infrared Mapping
Spectrometer on the Galileo Jupiter Orbiter, which has been observing
the giant planet for over five years now.  The huge amount of data
acquired is gradually being analysed in terms of the structure,
composition, cloud physics and meteorology of Jupiter.  Dynamical
modelling of Jupiter's atmosphere is also underway, with emphasis on
trying to understand the banded structure and the dynamics of the
giant eddies, including the Great Red Spot.  Cassini (see below)
recently flew by Jupiter on its way to Saturn, and produced an
additional data set which complements that from Galileo.

<BR><I>Scheme of some of the processes on Titan that will be investigated

<P>Following the successful Galileo Jupiter project, we built a major
part of the Composite Infrared Spectrometer for the Cassini probe to
Saturn.  This is now on its way, and preparations are being made for
the analysis of the data, which will start to arrive in 2004.  A major
target for Cassini, as well as Saturn itself, is the large moon Titan,
with its intriguing Earth-like atmosphere.  Again, the gola of our
measurements is primarily atmospheric structure, composition, cloud
physics and meteorology of Saturn and Titan.


<P><A NAME="comets"><H3>Comets</H3></A>
<TABLE WIDTH=100%><TD VALIGN=TOP>
<P>As part of the science team for the European ROSETTA mission to
comet Wirtanen, we plan to study the structure and properties of the
comet's atmosphere (coma), including determining its composition
and non-equilibrium chemistry.

<BR><I>Mars Wind Tunnel</I></TD><TD VALIGN=TOP>
<P>In addition to the development of space instruments, the planetary
programme at Oxford requires extensive laboratory work on the
calibration of instruments and sensors, and on the spectroscopy of
planetary atmospheric gases and solid and liquid cloud materials.  For
example, one of our current doctoral students, Colin Wilson, is
calibrating the Beagle 2 and NetLander wind sensors in a special wind
tunnel (see picture).  Another student, Neil Bowles, is measuring the
spectral properties of methane and ammonia at the infrared wavelengths
used to study them on Jupiter.  Carly Howett is working with our
collaborators in California to obtain the spectral properties of the
solid ammonia and ammonium hydrosulphide clouds that are found in the
atmospheres of the outer planets.
<P>Elsewhere on this web site details can be found of the
department's work on numerical general circulation models of
planetary atmospheres, including Mars, Venus and Jupiter, and on
laboratory simulations of dynamical behaviour of rotating fluids.
Theoretical work on radiative transfer in planetary and comet
atmospheres is also undertaken.
