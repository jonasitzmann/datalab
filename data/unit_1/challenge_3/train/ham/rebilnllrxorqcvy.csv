<h4>Aims of the Scheme</h4>
<p align=justify><font color=maroon>
The scheme is designed to provide individual members of the Society in higher education institutions with grants up to a maximum of &pound;500 in support of geographical research. &nbsp; Awards are given specifically to help with the cost of travel and subsistence associated with attendance at conferences and symposia where the applicant intends to present a research paper. &nbsp; Applications for travel grants, which were awarded for the first time in 1999, are welcomed particularly from postgraduates and those early in their research careers.  &nbsp; Typical grants are in the region of &pound;250 - &pound;500.

<br>
<h4>Eligibility</h4>
<p align=justify><font color=maroon>
Grants are available to individuals only, and applicants must be members of the Royal Scottish Geographical Society. &nbsp; No more than one application can be accepted from an individual per year, and re-applications for the same project are not acceptable. &nbsp; Awards cannot be made retrospectively, and applications must be submitted in time for them to be considered by the Society's Research Committee before the relevant travel is due to take place. &nbsp; The closing date for applications is 31st January each year.
<font color=black></p>
<br>
<h4>Application Procedure</h4>
<p align=justify><font color=maroon>
The linked application form (in <a href="TravForm.htm" alt="Travel Form">HTML</a> or <a href="TravForm.doc">MS Word document</a> format) may be printed or used as a document template in applying for an RSGS Travel Grant. &nbsp; Alternatively, a hard copy may be requested from the Society's Administrative Officer at the address below. &nbsp; Please print on only one side of the paper. &nbsp; On completion, the form should be submitted with supporting documents, including an abstract of the paper to be presented. &nbsp; Word processed and electronically submitted forms are acceptable, but must follow the prescribed page layout.
<font color=black></p>
<br>
<h4>Awarding Procedures</h4>
<p align=justify><font color=maroon>
The Research Committee will review applications and approve grants to be awarded. &nbsp; No
interviews will be held. &nbsp; All applicants will be notified in writing within one month of the Research Committee meeting, and awards will be published in the Society's <i>GeogScot</i> Newsletter. &nbsp; It is regretted that no correspondence will be entered into except under exceptional circumstances. &nbsp; Grants will be paid, subject to the applicant accepting the offer, when expenditure is about to be incurred. &nbsp; Grants not taken up within one year will be cancelled.
<font color=black></p>
<br>
<h4>Conditions of the Award</h4>
<p align=justify><font color=maroon>
All award-holders are requested to submit a brief report within one year of being offered a travel grant. &nbsp; This report, extending to no more than one side of an A4 sheet, should include a full statement of how the money was spent, details of any other funds obtained, and a list of publications or conference papers resulting from the award. &nbsp; The Society's support should be acknowledged in any publication, and a copy of all the publications sent to the
Society. &nbsp; Money not spent as outlined in the application must be refunded.
