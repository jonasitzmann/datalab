<strong>INTRODUCTION</strong><br>
With now unwonted alacrity we follow up last month's Harvest with another
modest but well-winnowed crop, the first of our fourth series. Included are
some plants with all the appearance of being CERES clones - though
genetically modified for higher productivity and ease-resistance. Nothing
revolutionary or ground-breaking this time, but confirmation that good use
is being made of the internet to deliver substantial and well-organised
services to the scholarly community.
<p>
Talking of which, CERES is pleased to announce the second of its online
projects under our COPIA banner. 'Sidneiana' is a set of pages offering
documents and materials relating to the Sidney family. At present these
include:
<ul>
<li>Songs and Sonnets - musical reconstructions of Philip Sidney's Certain
Sonnets 6 ('To the tune of Basciami vita mia') and Robert Sidney's Song 12
('To a French tune') 
<li>A Very Godly Letter - Sir Henry Sidney's letter of advice to the young
Philip Sidney 
<li>Nevitt's Memorial - Sir Robert Sidney's wardrobe keeper offers an account
of his master's income and expenditure from c.1590 to 1626: a history of
Robert Sidney and the Jacobean court through clothes and lands 
<li>The Triumph of Death - a modernised and emended edition of the Countess
of Pembroke's translation of Petrarch
<li>Philarchos' Tale - a narrative from the manuscript continuation of Mary
Wroth's 'Urania'
</ul>
The pages are at: <a href=http://www.english.cam.ac.uk/ceres/sidneiana>http://www.english.cam.ac.uk/ceres/sidneiana</a>.
<p>
We hope that you may wish to contribute suggestions or even whole pages to
this framework. As with our other COPIA projects, we are very keen to have
your input. Head for <a href=http://www.english.cam.ac.uk/ceres/copia.htm>http://www.english.cam.ac.uk/ceres/copia.htm</a>.

<h2 align=center>ELECTRONIC RESOURCES</h2>
<strong>ARDEN SHAKESPEARE ONLINE</strong><br>
In a remarkable follow-up to its release of the Arden Shakespeare CD-ROM,
based on Arden II, Arden have developed an online version using all current
editions in the new Arden III series. The numbers are made up by Arden II
editions, but these will be replaced as the print editions of Arden III
appear. Ardenonline can be previewed for the next few weeks prior to its
release in May (at which point your institution will need to pay up,
although the service does look to be extremely competitively priced).
<p>
Ardenonline provides the complete works of Shakespeare on the World Wide
Web, plus introductions (some exclusively written for the resource),
commentary and variant notes, performance illustrations and reviews, and
more. Full details are available on the website at: <a href=http://www.ardenshakespeare.com/ardenonline/>http://www.ardenshakespeare.com/ardenonline/</a>.
<p>
Access to the preview version itself is by username and password (this is
the same for everyone). The details are as follows:
<p>
username: preview<br>
password: 4april99
<p>
What is there does not in any major respects differ from the printed books,
although there are some front-end introductions written specially. The
major gain will be evident to anyone who is used to using electronic texts
and resources to save time - the texts and the site are fully searchable
and everything is linked together hypertextually. Superb use of frames
means that the basic page always has text, notes, and contents visible,
along with a toolbar at the top. Any frame can be resized or expanded,
though the toolbar needs a button to restore the default frames as it is
easy to lose access to the table of contents. Most images from the books
are included (though some are withheld through copyright problems,
including, inexplicably, some facsimiles of quarto pages). The texts are
beautifully presented with textual variants flagged up in the margin with a
blue 'v' and notes in the commentary with a red 'c'. This gets round a
persistent problem in critical editions.
<p>
There is a very thorough help page to enable you to make the most of what
is, though complex, an elegant and intuitive interface. Each text will have
a set of 'resource links', though these only exist for Lear as yet. These
offer thematised links to bits of the text and apparatus and a host of
images from past performances.
<p>
There are doubtless flaws and shortcomings in what is a very ambitious use
of hypertext to enhance the reader's use of the excellent Arden editions.
Which is why the service is previewing. So have a look, and make your
criticisms known.
<p>
<strong>JSTOR</strong><br>
With parallel sites in the US and UK to which libraries and other
institutions can subscribe JSTOR seems to represent the way forward for
online journal access.
<ul>
<li><a href=http://www.jstor.org/>http://www.jstor.org/</a>
<li><a href=http://www.jstor.ac.uk/>http://www.jstor.ac.uk/</a>
</ul>
If your institution subscribes you will be allowed to enter one or the
other site. If not, there are links for information at least. The service
archives such journals as the <cite>Journal of the History of Ideas</cite>, <cite>Studies in
the Renaissance</cite>, <cite>Renaissance News</cite>, <cite>Renaissance Quarterly</cite> (the amalgam of
the previous two), and <cite>Shakespeare Quarterly</cite>. On their way are the likes of
<cite>ELH</cite>, <cite>MLN</cite>, <cite>Representations</cite>, and <cite>Yale French Studies</cite>. So it offers online
access to some really great scholarship from the last 7 decades and not
just the latest ejournal rubbish. Pages are digitised, so you can read,
quote, and refer to a journal article without concessions.  But the
database is also powerfully searchable, though not viewable, as plain text,
so you can do author/title/keyword searches, view an article, paste its
pages into a wordprocessor (an easier way to print off than via the browser
in this case), and you have an offprint.
<p>
This is digital journal heaven. Part of what is so depressing about BIDS,
MLA, etc., is that you can generate hundreds of useful sounding references
in a minute, but this just creates more work going to a Library to look at
them. JSTOR genuinely saves time and improves the use that can be made of
journals.
<p>
<strong>OUP JOURNALS</strong><br>
OUP have organised a very fine site offering tables and contents for all
their journals, along with abstracts and other information where possible.
Each journal has its homepage, with tables of contents and the option of
subscription to receive new tocs by email. These are listed at: <a href=http://www.oup.co.uk/jnls/fields/>http://www.oup.co.uk/jnls/fields/</a>.  Also, there is a single toc subscription page at: <a href=http://www.oup.co.uk/jnls/tocmail/>http://www.oup.co.uk/jnls/tocmail/</a>.  The journals include <cite>RES</cite>, <cite>NQ</cite>, <cite>Renaissance Studies</cite>, <cite>Past and Present</cite>, and <cite>The Library</cite>.
<p>
<strong>EARLY MODERN ENGLAND SOURCE</strong><br>
<a href=http://www.quelle.org/emes/emes.html>http://www.quelle.org/emes/emes.html</a><br>
A site aimed primarily at historians, which some of us dare think ourselves
on good days, I know. Seems alarmingly like CERES done in English by
Germans with expensive software. That is, it offers a fine and
comprehensive site detailing seminars and conferences in the UK, North
America, and the Rest of the World; listing online journals and other links
of interest; and even offering a direct link to Blackwells online bookshop.
The site is searchable and information can be submitted to it direct. Part
of a presumably expanding site run by 'QuelleNet' (a mysterious cooperative
which manages not to identify whence or by whom it is run). The site has a
tendency to play early modern harpsichord music at you without warning. We
promise never to do this at CERES.
<p>
<strong>INTERNETOGRAPHY ON RENAISSANCE INTELLECTUAL HISTORY</strong><br>
<a href=http://www.phil-hum-ren.uni-muenchen.de/GGRENirDB/>http://www.phil-hum-ren.uni-muenchen.de/GGRENirDB/</a><br>
On the subject of sites like CERES, here is one for intellectual
historians. Which, I know, some of us like to think of ourselves as also,
on extremely good days. GGRENir is run by Heinrich Kuhn of the Munich
Institute for Renaissance Intellectual History. Their homepage is also
worth a look: <a href=http://www.phil-hum-ren.uni-muenchen.de/default.htm>http://www.phil-hum-ren.uni-muenchen.de/default.htm</a>.
The internetography contains links to several hundred internet resources of
relevance to Renaissance intellectual history. The database is browsable
and searchable, and is tightly constructed with separate pages for every
item a search might conjure up. Whilst the main focus is on history of
philosophy, history of science, history of art, history of literature,
history of theology, political history, are covered as well.
<p>
<strong>THE CLASSICS PAGE</strong><br>
A very useful site, this, from the Ad Fontes Academy in Virginia. Based on
a  thorough and up to date links page and its own Latin Library of primary
texts: <a href=http://patriot.net/~lillard/cp/>http://patriot.net/~lillard/cp/</a>
<p>
<strong>ENGLISH CALENDAR</strong><br>
This site, run by Ian MacInnes of Albion College, will translate between
old and new style dates, or work out on what day of the week a certain date
fell. It can also calculate the major dates of the ecclesiastical calendar
for a given year, and regnal years: <a href=http://www.albion.edu/fac/engl/calendar/>http://www.albion.edu/fac/engl/calendar/</a>.
<p>
<strong>THE INTERNET RENAISSANCE BAND</strong><br>
In essence, a vast library of Renaissance music in compact midi format
(that is, not a recording, but the instructions to your sound card
synthesiser, if you have one, to play the notes - the exact modern
equivalent of the paper roll for a pianola).
<a href=http://www.csupomona.edu/~jcclark/emusic/renaissa.html>http://www.csupomona.edu/~jcclark/emusic/renaissa.html</a>
<p>
<strong>VALENTINE ARMOURIES</strong><br>
Corny but fascinating site, at which one can view and buy reproduction
armour from 500 BC to about 1800. A full suit of Greenwich style armour
will set you back $5000 or so. Also features information and links on
heraldry, and a fair selection of reasonably priced casual wear for your
days off: <a href=http://www.varmouries.com>http://www.varmouries.com</a>.
<p>
<strong>ESOTERICA: THE JOURNAL OF ESOTERIC STUDIES</strong><br>
<a href=http://www.esoteric.msu.edu/>http://www.esoteric.msu.edu/</a><br>
Esoterica is a new electronic journal devoted to the study of Western
esotericism. Areas of study includes such disparate movements and
traditions as alchemy, Freemasonry, the Kabbala, magic, mysticism, and
secret or semi-secret orders, as well as these movements' or traditions'
impact on artistic, literary, political and social figures.
<p>
Esoterica, as an electronic journal and academic resource, has two main
goals: providing, on the one hand, illustrated original articles on aspects
of esotericism by specialists in the field, and on the other hand, primary
research materials of use to scholars and teachers, including links to
special collections and archives as well as lists of recent dissertations
in the field.  The journal also features book reviews and announcements.
