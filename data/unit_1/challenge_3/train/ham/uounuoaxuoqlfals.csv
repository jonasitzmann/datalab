<h2 align=center>NEWS FROM THE NET</h2>

<p>

<strong>THE MILTON TRANSCRIPTION PROJECT</strong><br>

The MTP is dedicated to making all of John Milton's poetry and

prose available for public access on the Internet.  Although most

of Milton's poetry is available in modernized forms, the MTP is

preparing more accurate electronic facsimiles of the early editions

of Milton's poems.  In addition, most of the English and Latin

prose - along with a great deal of fascinating Miltoniana - remains

to be done.  Volunteers are invited to transcribe as much or as

little as they wish; each transcription will be proofread,

formatted, checked, and refereed.  All accepted transcriptions will be

credited by name.  More info can be had from <a href=mailto:dithw@ttacs.ttu.edu>Professor Hugh Wilson</a>, MTP Editor, or <a href=mailto:coldiron@jhunix.hcf.jhu.edu>Professor A.E.B. Coldiron</a>, MTP Internet Liaison.

<p>

<strong>H-CERVANTES</strong><br>

New H-NET network for scholars and professionals active in studies

related to Miguel de Cervantes Saavedra.  It encourages scholarly

exchanges on all aspects of the author, his works, his circle, his

times, and scholarship on the era, and welcomes participation by

scholars/specialists from all disciplines.  More information is available at the <a href=http://h-net.msu.edu>H-Net Web Site (http://h-net.msu.edu)</a>. To join H-Cervantes, please send a message to

<a href=mailto:listserv@h-net.msu.edu>listserv@h-net.msu.edu</a> with no subject line and only this text:

sub h-Cervantes firstname lastname, institution.  Capitalization does not matter, but spelling, spaces and commas do.

<strong>BROWN WOMEN WRITERS PROJECT</strong><br>

The main feature of this site is a list of texts 1350-1830 written

by women which are available in paper form (orders via e-mail,

details on website).  It also has a discussion group and relevant

links and information on conferences etc.  The project is

associated with OUP who are printing a series of WWP books.  It can be reached at <a href=http://www.stg.brown.edu/projects/wwp/wwp_home.html>http://www.stg.brown.edu/projects/wwp/wwp_home.html</a>

<p>

<a name=hrIII></a>

<strong>HYPERTEXT RICHARD III:</strong> <br>

Produced by the Richard III Society, this is not a scholarly

edition but rather an electronic text with links at appropriate

points to notes taken from Charles Ross's 1981 biography of

Richard.  Also offers links to related Richard III materials such

as ballad versions of the story, excerpts of historical accounts,

and details of films and other performances.  Look for Richard at <a href=http://www.r3.org/>http://www.r3.org</a>.

<strong>SPENSER HOME PAGE</strong><br>

This page has excellent links to services elsewhere, as well as

details of how to subscribe to SPENSER-L (see its review below), a

whopping Spenser bibliography, and page manager Richard Bear's own

collection of electronic texts.  These include an ongoing

illustrated hypertext 'Lady of May', and transcriptions from

facsimiles of 'Amoretti and Epithalamion', 'Astrophel and Stella',

Wroth's 'Pamphilia to Amphilanthus', and so on.  Also, there are

scannings-in of editions by Grosart; most of Spenser is available

in this form.  View Spenser at <a href=http://darkwing.uoregon.edu/~rbear/>http://darkwing.uoregon.edu/~rbear/</a>.

<strong>16TH CENTURY RENAISSANCE ENGLISH LITERATURE</strong><br>

This is really a service to make term projects fun for students,

but it still has some great pictures (Sidney in colour) for your

wallpaper, and some good links.  It can be accessed at <a href=http://www.luminarium.org/lumina.html> http://www.luminarium.org/lumina.html</a>.

<p>

<a name=mwsti></a>

<strong>MR WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE & THE INTERNET</strong><br>

A very good set of links with brief explanatory comments.  This

page provides a good survey of the numerous sites where you can

find Renaissance resources and particularly texts.  Mine these veins at <a href=http://daphne.palomar.edu/shakespeare/> http://daphne.palomar.edu/shakespeare/</a>.  
<p>

<a name=ddw></a>

<strong>DE DOCTRINA WEBSITE</strong><br>

This features a lengthy scholarly essay prepared by five scholars

on the provenance and authorship of Milton's <cite>DDC</cite>.  It can be reached at <a href=http://genmac.bangor.ac.uk/ddc.htm>http://genmac.bangor.ac.uk/ddc.htm</a>.

<p>

<a name=iemls></a>

<strong>INTERACTIVE EMLS</strong><br>

Keep an eye on Early Modern Literary Studies, an on-line journal

and one of the best sources of Renaissance links.  Its interactive

section, IEMLS, is accumulating a broad range of texts and

other resources and links: <a href=http://www.humanities.ualberta.ca/emls/emlshome.html>http://www.humanities.ualberta.ca/emls/emlshome.html</a>.

<p>

<a name=op></a>

<strong>OVID PROJECT</strong><br>

Some very pretty pictures at the University of

Vermont; site features engravings from the 1640 Sandys translation and

1703 engravings by Johann Wilhelm Baur.  Achieve the green-mountain state at <a href=http://www.uvm.edu/~hag/ovid/>http://www.uvm.edu/~hag/ovid/</a>.

<strong>MAILING LISTS</strong><br>

Diane Kovacs maintains an exhaustive-seeming list of scholarly,

widely accessible, e-mailing lists.  URL: <a href=http://www.n2h2.com/KOVACS/>http://www.n2h2.com/KOVACS/</a>

<strong>ITER<br>

The Bibliography of Renaissance Europe 1350-1700</strong><br>

Visit: <a href=http://iter.library.utoronto.ca/>http://iter.library.utoronto.ca/</a>.

ITER currently has 50,000 articles on the database and will have

100,000 books as well:  clearly a database to be reckoned with.

The plan is that users will have to subscribe, but at present

(6/97) ITER is FREE!

<p>

<a name=sa></a>

<strong>SHAKESPEARE</strong> (again)<br>

Another one to add to the list, but not just one of the crowd.

Matty Farrow of the Persistent Systems Research Group at the

University of Sydney has developed a site with a good search

facility and different versions of the collected works.  A new

version of the search program is under development; try it out at<a href=http://www.psrg.cs.usyd.edu.au/~matty/Shakespeare/> http://www.psrg.cs.usyd.edu.au/~matty/Shakespeare/</a>.

<a name=pw></a>

<strong>PALAEOGRAPHY ON THE WEB</strong><br>

Perhaps surprisingly the Web is not stuffed with samples of

fearsome Elizabethan secretary hands.  What is underway, however,

is a large scale digitising of large numbers of manuscripts and

rare books in the name of access and also of conservation.

Currently pretty pictures are the order of the day.

<p>

A good place to start for the MS browser is:

<a href=http://www.georgetown.edu/labyrinth/subjects/mss/mss.html> http://www.georgetown.edu/labyrinth/subjects/mss/mss.html</a>. This has links to on-line manuscript catalogues, on-line

manuscripts, and (perhaps most interestingly at this stage) to major manuscript projects that are underway e.g. in the Bodleian, British Library, Vatican Library etc.

<strong>INTERNET SHAKESPEARE EDITIONS</strong><br>

CERES would like members to give these editions a thorough going

over and to report back to us.  Clearly the potential of this

resource is enormous. Draft electronic versions of a number of

early quarto and folio texts are now available from the site of the

Internet Shakespeare Editions.  The texts are available for

teaching purposes, and can be downloaded in either HTML format as

you browse, or as text files in what is variously known as

'Interchange Format,' 'Rich Text Format,' or 'RTF' by ftp. Most

word processors should be able to translate the text files to

provide basic formatting.

<p>

The site for the Internet Shakespeare Editions uses the metaphor of

a library as a principle of organization.  From the <cite>Foyer</cite> you can

access discussions about the aims of the ISE texts, a list of the

Editorial Board, and some material on the principles of tagging

that are being employed.  The <cite>Library</cite> will contain the final

editions (nothing there yet).  All material in this section will be

refereed.  The <cite>Annex</cite> is an area for informal discussion and the

posting of useful, but unrefereed materials. This is where the

current texts can be found.

<p>

The following are available in the <cite>Annex</cite> so far:

<ul>

<li><cite>Romeo and Juliet</cite>: Q1, Q2, F

<li><cite>Hamlet</cite>: Q1, Q2, F

<li><cite>King Lear</cite>: Q1, F

</ul>

The website for Internet Shakespeare editions is: <a href=http://web.uvic.ca/shakespeare>http://web.uvic.ca/shakespeare</a>.

<strong>COPAC</strong><br>

COPAC is a new nationally accessible catalogue.  Based at the

University of Manchester, it provides unified access to the

consolidated online catalogues of some of the largest university

research libraries in the UK and Ireland.  COPAC is normally

available 24 hours a day 365 days a year and access is free of

charge.

<p>

The COPAC database currently contains approx. 3.5 million records.

These represent the merged online library catalogues of:  Cambridge

University, Edinburgh University, Glasgow University, Leeds

University, Oxford University, Trinity College Dublin.

<p>

The records from a further twelve university library catalogues

will be added in due course, and there are plans for the addition

of material from further libraries in the future.  Records for

materials published pre-1900 make up c.4% of the database and the

proportion of older materials is growing.  Records for periodicals

make up some 4% of the COPAC database.<br>

<dl>

<dt>Accessing COPAC is via one of two interfaces:</dt>

<dd>A WWW Interface: http://copac.ac.uk/copac/

<p>

A Text Interface: Telnet: copac.ac.uk (username: copac password: copac)</dd></dl>

Online search assistance is provided and printed User Guides are

available for both interfaces.  Postscript versions of the User

Guides are available for downloading at: <a href=http://copac.ac.uk/copac/userguide/>http://copac.ac.uk/copac/userguide/</a>.

<strong>RENAISSANCE EMBLEMS</strong><br>

William Barker, Mark Feltham, and Jean Guthrie of the Memorial

University of Newfoundland have put online Andrea Alciato's <cite>Emblematum liber</cite>, text in Latin with English

translation.  After an update at the end of 1996 the site now

includes the emblems of Whitney, Lefevre, and Palmer.

See <a href=http://www.mun.ca/alciato/>http://www.mun.ca/alciato/</a>. This site also has links to other resources, including a website at Glasgow specialising in French emblem books:<a href=http://www.gla.ac.uk/Library/Emblems/> http://www.gla.ac.uk/Library/Emblems/</a>.

<strong>FONTS</strong><br>

CERES is interested to hear if members have good examples of

Renaissance (or other useful) fonts on their computers. A

premilinary foray into this area has unearthed a useful article

(how-to-do-it etc.) by Grazyna Cooper, of the Oxford University

Humanities Centre, at<a href=http://info.ox.ac.uk/oucs/humanities/fonts.html> http://info.ox.ac.uk/oucs/humanities/fonts.html</a>. NB when this article talks about 'Old English' it doesn't necessarily mean Anglo-Saxon. More information and possible downloads at the following URL:

<a href=http://info.ox.ac.uk/oucs/humanities/chcdown.html#oldengpc> http://info.ox.ac.uk/oucs/humanities/chcdown.html#oldengpc</a>.  There is also a font based on the Shakespeare First Folio from the Illinois Shakespeare Festival site.  It includes no numerals and few special characters, which limits its use. A final point worth making is that some commercially available fonts are effectively early modern in style, such as Adobe's Caslon series (certainly available for Macs).  This, of course, has the special characters and numbers, but also ligatures and some swashes.

<strong>EARLY MODERN TRANS-ATLANTIC ENCOUNTERS</strong><br>

<strong>THE PERDITA PROJECT</strong><br>

This is a planned database for early modern women's manuscript

collections. Run by Nottingham Trent University and the Oxford

Centre for Humanities Computing, it aims to produce a comprehensive

guide to over 300 miscellanies compiled by women. Publication may

be on CD-ROM or on the Internet; in either case the Internet will

be used to provide updated information. Interested contributors

and/or consumers should contact Victoria Burke (<a href=mailto:ems3burkeve@ntu.ac.uk>ems3burkeve@ntu.ac.uk</a>).

<strong>CTI GUIDE TO DIGITAL RESOURCES</strong><br>

A pretty impressive list of various kinds of electronic resources based in Oxford. Still under

development, so the specifically literary section remains to be

evaluated.  Still, the 'Bibliographic Resources and Tools' is

useful, particularly as a starting point.  It includes entries for

twenty-eight bibliographic databases and other packages, with links

to Internet resources, and an overview essay of the resources

available in this area.  Take an electronic trip to

afforded by the latter to anyone acquainted with one of the

introductory sites already featured by CERES (EMLS, Jack Lynch,

<p>

<strong>SPENSER-L</strong><br><cite>Reviewed Spring, 1997</cite><p>

SPENSER-L is an unmoderated on-line discussion of things Spenserian

and Sidneian.  The list has about 300 members, some of whom will be

temporary - students encouraged to think that sending in an enquiry

may get their essay written for them.  Most, though, are decent scholars.  Contributions tend to be off the top of the

head rather than considered; but then, this willingness to talk

shop without checking references first has its advantages.  The

list is very good at responding promptly to simple queries ('What's

the latest article on...?'), and at brainstorming (a request for

analogues and sources for images of mining in Spenser, very

productively).  Also, a considered but open-ended question engaging

members' general understanding of critical trends, methodology, or

Spenser even, can lead to many provoked thoughts.  Information and

references can be vague, though seldom inscrutably so, but the

recent recruiting of 'Analogy' Nohrnberg is raising the stakes

here; worrying of course to see scholars getting addicted to e-mail

(nosce teipsum!), but a precious few provide great service to the

scholarly community.

<p>

SPENSER-L snuggles under the broad aegis of Richard Bear, who also

<strong>REVIEW OF MILTON-L DISCUSSION GROUP</strong><br> <cite>Reviewed by Colin Burrow, Spring 1997</cite>
<p>

As one versed in the extreme indecorum of Milton's own

'discussions' with his enemies, I imagined that the items on the

Milton-L discussion group would be gobbets of bile.  Here at last,

I fondly dreamed, Stanley Fish and Christopher Ricks would finally

say what they really thought of each other, and Abdiels would

zealously defend the cause of righteousness.  No such luck.  The

group is at present rather sleepy, and when not dozing is

scrupulously polite.  Even when a sophomore asks for hot tips about

Milton's attitudes to beauty no-one says 'Er, what do blind

iconoclasts usually think about beauty?'  Instead there's a great

deal of 'You might try looking at the description of Adam and Eve's

bower at the end of book IV.  Good luck with your term paper.'  The

advice is often quite teachy, and so is quite unoffputting and

often quite helpful.  It's hard to imagine Milton himself being

that nice to John Phillips et al.  Roy Flannagan puts in occasional

genial and learned words when either too much heat or too much

dozing is being generated. Odd little angles (not angels) pop up,

and the odd really bad joke.  I've found that when contributors

suggest reading in reply to queries they tend to give half-

remembered references on the hoof, so don't expect gleamingly

up-to-date-references which you can paste into bibliographies.

Unless you are desperate to have as many items in your in-tray as

possible (as sad as me in fact) it's probably better to subscribe

to Milton Digest, which pastes all the contributions handily

together.  That way you only have to delete one item...  There is

an archive of past contributions (address below), which includes

discussions of Milton's theodicy, gnostic elements in 'Paradise

Lost' and so on.  It is unedited though, and the list as a whole is

not moderated, so expect some dross, and not necessarily bullion

dross at that.

<p>

An archive of contributions in HTML format is under construction

(i.e. not much use at present) at:<a href=http://www.urich.edu/~creamer/archive.html> http://www.urich.edu/~creamer/archive.html</a>.

<p>

The bulk of the archive, though, can be obtained by anonymous FTP

from ftp://urvax.urich.edu/milton/milton.  Big files, though:  long

toil to read, too, since each message is preceded by a long account

of how the electrons which make it up went around the world.

Sometimes, one fears, the electrons zipped in vain.

<strong>REVIEW OF MANTOVANO-L (DISCUSSION GROUP OF VIRGIL AND HIS AFTERLIFE)</strong><br>
<cite>Reviewed by Colin Burrow, Spring 1997</cite>
<p>
It's hard to know what a discussion group should be.  I suppose it

should be fairly polite to initiates who ask for a few tips, and

should let scholars know what other scholars want to know in a

format which saves them time.  There's also a case for a group

which doesn't encourage people to say 'Oh hum there was this

article in the BJRL a few years ago' when they're asked for reading

on an arcane point.  A good list manager will encourage

contributors to give full and accurate citations in answer to

queries.  People who want to learn what a discussion group can do

might do a lot worse than subscribe to Mantovano-L for a week or

so.  Topics vary as they always do in these groups:  one day a

teacher might be asking which edition of Virgil to use to teach

High-School students, and get a surprisingly unanimous answer the next;

another day someone might wonder if Fulgentius's commentary on the

'Aeneid' is partly intended as a joke.  Students who ask what the

Virgilian allusions in Tennyson's 'Virgil' are get rapidly starved

out in the fairly recondite air of this group, but it's usually

kindly done.

<p>

Presiding over it all is David Wilson-Okamura, who does a heroic

job.  He chugs out reading suggestions with great accuracy and

detail on some fairly restricted areas, and keeps decorum kindly.

(His Bookmarks are a very good start to anyone looking for Latin

material on the Web, by the way: <a href=http://student-www.uchicago.edu/users/dswilson/bookmark.html> http://student-www.uchicago.edu/users/dswilson/bookmark.html</a>)

Subscribers to Ceres might find the whole thing a bit specialised

in areas which aren't quite theirs (it has a very strong interest

in early commentaries on Virgil, for example), but it is good to

see that the temptations of e-mail to say what the hell you like as

badly as you like can be resisted, and that the result can be a

genuinely useful scholarly medium.

<p>

Mantovano says that it exists to discuss:  1.The works attributed

to Publius Vergilius Maro; 2.Commentary on Virgil and his works; a.

from late antiquity (e.g., Servius, Macrobius); b. from the middle

ages (e.g., 'Anselm of Laon'); c. from the renaissance (e.g.,

Landino); d. from the enlightenment to the present; 3.Virgil's

influence on subsequent literature (e.g., Lucan, Statius, Dante,

Ariosto, Petrarch, Tasso, Spenser, Milton). My experience suggests

that 1 and 2 are more popular among its contributors than 3.

<h2 align=center>ELECTRONIC TEXTS</h2>

<p>

This section is dedicated to sites and services which provide

access to texts in various electronic forms.  Many of the Internet

sites found above or in the CERES guide no. 2, 'Internet Sites',

can lead you to texts as well.  The point of this section is to

explain how to gain access to useful text providers.

<p>
<a name=ota></a>

<strong><a href=http://ota.ox.ac.uk/>OXFORD TEXT ARCHIVE</a></strong><br> <cite>Reviewed Spring, 1997</cite><p>

This sounds like a great service, but, as ever, what is freely

available is useless, and what is good takes some effort to get

hold of (SEE BELOW).  You might want to see what is available in

the 3 main categories (free by FTP; application only; Oxford users

only) by looking at the main catalogue

(<a href=http://firth.natcorp.ox.ac.uk/ota/public/catalogue/index.html>http://firth.natcorp.ox.ac.uk/ota/public/catalogue/index.html</a>).  As far as freely available stuff

goes, for some reason Oxford have removed line breaks from all

verse texts.  So Paradise Lost reads 'Book One Of Man's first

disobedience and the fruit Of that forbidden tree', and so on.

Beautifully ancient as a writing system, but annoying.  Such free

texts as this and Marvell work just as well for concordancing in

this form, however, so unless you actually propose reading the

thing on screen, or printing it all off, this format is not as

handicapped as it might appear to be.  The KJB is available via

this route, and has paragraph breaks, not because it is more

authentic a manifestation of God's lexicon than Paradise Lost, of

course, but because it is prose.  If without a Rosetta Stone, you

may wish to look for texts in more eclectic spaces, such as the

home pages for the authors concerned (Spenser home page has links

to Milton home page, and MILTON-L home page).

<p>

Several CERES members now have experience of acquiring electronic

texts from the OTA.  Texts are divided into various classes: P

(publically available), U (available to scholars), A (as U but

requires written permission from the person who deposited the

text), X (Oxford users only).  The introduction above dealt with

texts publically available over the internet.  Most texts, however,

are in class U.  Getting hold of these is more complicated, but

they tend to be of better quality and so greater utility.  Examples

include J.C. Smith's 'Faerie Queene', very usefully marked up with

book, canto, and stanza numbers; texts used to make some Cornell

concordances (e.g. Donow's Sidney); a transcription of the 1609

'Sonnets' deposited by Gary Taylor; and thousands of other things.

These may contain a smattering or a hailstorm of codes (for

instance for small capitals or italics), which you may be able to

utilise, or you may wish to delete [OTA has links to information

about mark-up systems].

<h2 align=center>RHETORIC RESOURCES ON THE NET</h2>

<p>

In making use of the many rhetoric-connected resources on the

internet one must bear in mind that the USA is a classical

republic.  Most of the services and most of the people using them

are connected to institutions which teach rhetoric as a part of

courses on writing or communication.  The list H-RHETOR is a case

in point.  Its mission statement is as follows:

<p>

'H-RHETOR will provide a forum for scholars and teachers of the

history of rhetoric, writing, and communication.  There are no

geographical or chronological boundaries...  The primary purpose of

H-RHETOR is to enable historians to communicate current research

and research interests; to discuss new articles, books, papers,

approaches, methods and tools of analysis; and to test new ideas

and share comments and tips on teaching.'

<p>

The list can be received in a digested form (recommended), and is a

fairly busy forum.  It sends out details of [ir]relevant job

vacancies, conferences (such as a full programme for this year's

International Society for the History of Rhetoric conference), and

news (much forwarding of Reuters reports on the discovery of the

Lyceum in Athens).  As is the case with many lists, its members are

happiest to volunteer short contributions which require minimal

thought, though occasionally a discussion will lead to the exchange

of massive bibliographies on a particular issue which to

Renaissance rhetoricians may look utterly alien.  One string which

produced much correspondence started life as a suggestion that a

discussion be started on rhetoric in the New Testament.  A volley

of full references was returned from various professors of the

history of communication.  The writer of the original query then

wrote in with notable dignity to remark on the way he had been

taken for an ignoramus in need of bibliographical help rather than

a scholar wishing to exchange ideas.  And the references kept

coming ('good luck with your project').  The references were in

fact very good; and it is quite possible that the list members were

right in their assumptions and did not wish to get drawn into idle

banter.  But I have seen nothing to suggest that the many members

of H-RHETOR have much of a communal identity or sense of what the

list ought to be for.  (One possible exception was a lamentably

popular chain of rhetoric jokes.)  Where other lists have habits

and protocols, a culture in short, H-RHETOR seems an awkward

infant.  This may be because the area is too big.  Or perhaps it

was a bad year. If you wish to subscribe send the following message

to <a href=mailto:listserv@msu.edu>listserv@msu.edu</a>, substituting your name and affiliation whereappropriate: 'SUB H-RHETOR firstname surname affiliation' (Example: SUB H-RHETOR Philologus Waffle University of Cambridge).

<p>

The list is archived at Carnegie-Mellon University:

<a href=http://english-www.hss.cmu.edu/rhetoric/searching-h-rhetor.txt>http://english-www.hss.cmu.edu/rhetoric/searching-h-rhetor.txt</a>.

<p>

As for the WWW, there is no ideal site or set of links, perhaps

because most of the resources on offer are either texts or lists of

figures for students taught by H-RHETOR members.

You might like to try Carnegie-Mellon: <a href=http://english-www.hss.cmu.edu/rhetoric/>http://english-www.hss.cmu.edu/rhetoric/</a>.

Or the H-RHETOR homepage: <a href=http://h-net2.msu.edu/~rhetor/>http://h-net2.msu.edu/~rhetor/</a>. Or, more low-level, Georgia Rhetoric Resources:

<a href=http://www.lcc.gatech.edu/gallery/rhetoric/> http://www.lcc.gatech.edu/gallery/rhetoric/</a>.

Or, the American Communication Association links at <a href=http://www.uark.edu/depts/comminfo/www/classical.html> http://www.uark.edu/depts/comminfo/www/classical.html</a>.

Most of these seem to be links to texts, and to other sets of

links.  For which one might just as well start at Cambridge

classical links: <a href=http://www.classics.cam.ac.uk/Faculty/linguistics.html> http://www.classics.cam.ac.uk/Faculty/linguistics.html</a>.

Or try any of the general Renaissance links pages listed in our

starter guide.

<p>

Perhaps a better method to generate your own avenues of enquiry is

to try a search at, for example: <a href=http://altavista.digital.com> http://altavista.digital.com</a>.

An advanced search such as 'rhetoric and dialectic' [document will

contain both words], or 'rhetoric near dialectic' [within 10 words

of each other] will narrow the field.

<p>

But now for the good news.

<p>

A number of companies, like AltaVista, have computers which

cross-index every word every time it appears in any document on the

internet.  Making the most of this facility can be problematic: a

search on 'tragedy' will yield many tens of thousands of hits, 90%

of which will make no reference to literature.  If you can find the

right word, however - something nice and rare, something with only

one meaning - you can strike gold.  Any rhetorical figure is such a

word.  Just try searching for paralepsis at AltaVista, and you will

get a score of hits, very few of which are likely to be red

herrings.  Narrow it to 'paralepsis near (rhetoric or rhetorical)'

or 'paralepsis and epanorthosis' and further refine your bullion.

With a single word search you will also discover what I discovered,

which is a wonderful service offered by a company called ZenSoft.

They have created pages with links to the results of searches on

single words by all the dozen or so other companies (AltaVista,

Yahoo, HotBot, etc.) to create what they call 'Ultimate home

pages'.  I found a great deal at: <a href=http://zensoft.com/pages/aposiopesis.html> http://zensoft.com/pages/aposiopesis.html</a>.

<p>

This included useful references to articles; two discussions of the

figure in the New Testament from online biblical commentaries; an

interesting use of the figure in Joseph of Exeter's C12 'Judgement

of Paris', identified by the hypertext commentary; an online review

of Burmeister's 'Musica Poetica'; and a mention in a recent book on

art theory, a chapter from which had been put on the Web as a

taster.  I also discovered Monty Python's Announcement for People

who hate Figures of Speech:

<a href=http://bau2.uibk.ac.at/sg/python/Scripts/BrandNewPapperbok/HateFigures.html>http://bau2.uibk.ac.at/sg/python/Scripts/BrandNewPapperbok/HateFigures.html</a>.

<p>

The best thing about ZenSoft's service is that you can go straight

to the page by typing in the URL: http://zensoft.com/pages/[word, including proper nouns].html.

<p>

To test their comprehensiveness I tried the ultimate big word, and

was duly impressed:

<h2 align=center>EDITIONS AND ADAPTATIONS OF SHAKESPEARE ON CD-ROM</h2>

<cite>Reviewed by Colin Burrow, Spring 1997</cite>

<p>

If you have used any of the Chadwyck-Healey Databases before,

Editions and Adaptations of Shakespeare should look familiar.  The

interface is very similar to that of The Bible in English.  You are

presented at start-up (well, after several minutes frantic chugging

from a terminal in the UL) with either a search window which uses

standard Boolean terms, or with a menu of contents.  The icon with

a red magnifying glass on the toolbar opens the search window if it

does not open up straight away, but don't be hasty:  the main

problem with this software in its UL manifestation is that it is so

slow that you make every command twice since you don't believe just

how slow it is.  Wait.  It will happen.  Eventually.

<p>

The icon on the toolbar that looks like an open book will give you

the menu of contents, if it does not come onto the screen straight

away.  Again, wait.  From the menu you can choose from a range of

editions from the First Folio, through Rowe, Pope and co. up to the

Cambridge edition of 1863-6, and a range of adaptations of the

plays (from Dryden's All for Love through Davenant and Betterton's

Hamlet, to Brough's Perdita or the Royal Milkmaid).  What there

isn't is any representative modernised text to compare with the

earlier editorial tradition, although the Cambridge edition comes

as close to this as copyright allows.  (Probably the most reliable

source of a modern e-Shakespeare is Shakespeare by Andromeda, which

is the Oxford Shakespeare on CD, although the search engine is

dreadful and the application doesn't coexist happily with others).

You'll find too that sometimes Chadwyck-Healey have, for reasons of

space, opted for the first edition of a particular edited version

(as in the case of Rowe); in other cases they have taken the last

and fullest (as in the case of Malone's edition, where the text

used is the 1821 Malone/Boswell variorum).  These choices are on

the whole well made, but if you want to compare different editions

of the same edited version you have to return to the world of

paper.  (Don't worry: it's still out there.)  Click a radio button

on the menu and you will open up the volume you want.  (More

frantic wheezing and a lot of waiting.)  Click more radio buttons

and more editions will appear. (Chug wheeze.)

<p>

You can view an edition in three ways:  table of contents only;

text only; text and table of contents.  Unless you want to read

through from the start (let's face it, no-one reads e-text) it's

best to use text and table of contents (TTOC), which you access by

clicking the icon on the toolbar (helpfully unnamed) that looks

like a double column of text.  A screen split between contents

(left) and text (right) will appear.  You can adjust the divider by

dragging it with the mouse.  You can make text bigger or smaller by

pressing Shift at the same time as the up or down direction keys.

(Irritatingly there is no way of saving these changes for when you

open a new window, since there is no Preferences command, so you

have to do it every time you open a new volume.)  The TOC will have

the title of the volume with a + sign in a box beside it.  Click

once on the + sign to expand the contents list.  Beware oh ye

instinctive double clickers that if you double click here the

machine will groan and wheeze for a minute and briefly expand the

tree before groaning and wheezing and then collapsing it again.

<p>

Anyway, you then find the bit of the particular volume you want via

the Table of Contents and, well, you could then read it.  A

brilliant feature of the software (as of The Bible in English and

English Verse Drama), though, is its ability to indulge one's

desire infinitely to postpone reading into a play of difference

that is jouissance (a.k.a. nerdery).  That is that it lets you

collate versions easily.  Open several editions; click on the Full

Text icon on the toolbar (FT plus loads of lines); click on

'Window' in the command bar; then 'Tile Vertically'; find the place

you're looking for ('O what a rogue and peasant slave', say) in one

edition, and then click on the icon in the text window which looks

like two little books being pecked by red arrows.  Zap kerpow, all

your open editions are open at the same spot (or more or less, my

experiments suggest).

<p>

This is excellent for comparing quarto and folio texts.  Except

that on the UL machines it is not Zap kerpow at all but anxious

whirs and 'where's my brain gone?' from those dear little things

that were born to be dumb terminals.  Write to your MP asking for

more RAM in the UL.  Ask them to load the tables of contents onto

the hard disks of the terminals too, since that speeds the program

up a lot.

<p>

Note though:  reasonably enough this collation feature, or 'text

synchronise' feature as they call it, does not work with the

adaptations, since the texts are often so different as to make it

impossible to collate Shakespearean scenes with their derivatives.

Fair enough.  But, dear Mr Chadwyck-Healey why didn't you bother to

make the collation feature work for the sonnets and narrative

poems?  For these you just have to Page Down manually, which is

annoying, since someone has been paid to do the job electronically

and hasn't finished it off properly.  Do, by the way, use Page Down

rather than the scroll bar or the direction keys:  the scroll bar

covers the whole volume you're looking at, which might contain

twenty different printed volumes, so you move very crudely down;

the direction keys go so slowly that the temptation is to keep

pressing and pressing. If you do that you will find, minutes later,

that the UL terminal has had one of its sudden bursts of frisky

energy and has decided to canter past where you want to be.  And

then you page up ...

<p>

So it has bad points, slowness chief.

<p>

It also has some more serious deficiencies, several of which derive

from the way the early printed material is grouped into volumes.

Some of the 'volumes' are oddly selected.  'The First Folio and

Collected Poems' is particularly badly thought out:  the 'Collected

Poems' is Benson's 1640 edition of the Sonnets, reordered and

de-homosexualised, and full of demonstrably non-Shakespearean

material.  There is no Venus and Adonis or Lucrece in this volume,

and no 1609 Quarto of the Sonnets.  You have to look for these in

'Early Quartos and First Printings'.  The reason for this, is, I

suppose that the whole enterprise is aimed to represent the

reception of Shakespeare as much as an idealised version of his

texts abstracted from historical contingency, and Benson played a

very strong role in determining the reception of Shakespeare's

poems.  His text, lovingly reproduced with all its unquestionably

non-Shakespearean material (Heywood's Ovidian epistles and so on)

is given an extremely misleading centrality, for the uninitiated at

any rate, by being put together with F1 as the volume you are

presented with by default. And if you choose 'Search first Folio'

without otherwise limiting your search the program will also search

the 'Collected Poems'. So if you want to know about 'lo?e' in F1,

say, you will also have to find out something about Heywood's uses

of the word 'love', unless you select all the plays individually.

I suppose Margreta de Grazia's arguments that Benson's volume is

designed to look like the second Folio influenced Chadwyck-Healey

here, despite the fact that Benson's text derives entirely from the

1609 Quarto, and despite the fact that he and Cotes clearly were

not intending to produce a 'Collected Poems' volume since they made

no efforts to obtain the copyright on the narrative poems.

Benson's volume belongs among 'Adaptations', and the 'Folio and

Collected Poems' section ought to include F1 together with Q1 of

the Sonnets, Venus and Adonis and Lucrece.

<p>

The other quite seriously bad feature of the disposition of

material into volumes is that, while you can open several texts

from different volumes at the same time, you can't open different

texts from the same volume at the same time. This is a real problem

with the baggy monster volume 'Quartos and First Printings', which

contains both Q1 and Q2 of Hamlet, for example.  You can compare

Rowe's Hamlet with Pope's by viewing both at the same time.  You

can view the Hamlets of F1 and Q1 together with an eighteenth

century adaptation, because they occupy different volumes, but you

can't view Q1 and Q2 of Hamlet (unless I've missed something).

This is deeply perverse.  The volume of 'Quartos and First

Printings' ought to be divided into separate volumes for each play,

or at the very least into 'First Quartos' and 'Second Quartos'.

<p>

The search engine also has its perversities.  To select poems or

plays you use a browse feature.  This does not differentiate

between different Quartos of the same play.  So you ask it to

search through Hamlet in the 'Quartos and first printings' volume

and it will search Q1 and Q2 without giving you the option of

selecting which one you want.  This could be a real bore if you

want to follow up a hunch about the spelling preferences of a

particular print shop or compositor.  The front end allows you to

limit searches by character, by 'genre' (i.e. comedies, histories,

tragedies, late plays, which I'm not sure anyone really believes

are very useful ways of dividing the canon any more), by volume

(i.e. a particular edition or one of the software's groupings, such

as Adaptations).  But you cannot search exclusively within the

sonnets, since each sonnet (yes, each sonnet) is given a separate

entry in the Browse menu from which you select your titles to

search.  Try selecting all 154 Sonnets and the software (what a

darling!  After all it only costs rather over two thousand quid)

will tell you that you have selected too many items for it to

search.  The browse menu in the search window badly needs to be

redesigned so that you can select individual Quartos.  There should

be a single entry for the Sonnets as well as the entries for

individual ones, and a genre of 'non-dramatic verse' should be

added to the 'genre' browse menu.  Maybe one day.

<p>

The treatment of footnotes is also painful.  The program does not

have a View Footnotes command of the kind that most Word-processors

have, which would allow you to see all the footnotes on a

particular scene in, say, the Malone-Boswell Variorum edition;

instead you have to double-click on the book-shaped hypertext links

which are embedded at the relevant point in the text to see each

note individually. This opens a footnote window for the particular

footnote only, which is by default maximised:  zap (or rather chug

chug wheeze) no visible text, just a huge footnote plastered over

the whole screen.  Reduce the size of the note and you also reduce

the size of the text window, so you still can't see the text unless

you then maximise the text window, which then overlays the note

window, until you reactivate and move the note window.  Bloody

irritating, and the simple result of bad software design.  And you

have to go through this whole rigmarole every time you consult a

note, since the note window defaults back to maximised size.  This

way of presenting notes is just about OK with the Bible in English

Translation, where it's likely one would want to find only one

marginal gloss on a particular passage, but it is very annoying

with this type of material, where you might want to get a run at

how Malone reads a particular speech, say.  And since a lot of the

notes to the editions are lists of variants you need to be able to

see them easily at the same time as the text, without shifting

endless windowlets around the screen.  There really should be an

Options menu which would enable you to set a position for footnote

windows, choose fonts, choose default window sizes and so on.  But

there isn't.  Ho hum.

<p>

The worst problem, though, is saving.  The obvious way round some

of the limitations of the software is to save what you need onto

disk, so that you can view text and footnotes together, say, or do

word searches on the text of Q1 of the Sonnets.  The otherwise

helpful UL guide will not tell you so, but the program will only

allow you to save a limited proportion of any text.  If you try to

save a whole volume the program will say 'This is not allowed'.

Thanks.  If you try to save more than 40% of a particular volume

(but not the whole thing) the program will not make a murmur and

will just go ahead with the save routine.  But it will actually

save only 40% of what you want (the Chadwyck-Healey handbook, which

you can sign for in the Reading Room of the UL, warns you about

this a bit cryptically).  So if you select a large chunk of text to

save - say a whole play plus notes, but minus the prefatory matter,

from the Johnson edition - and save it to disk you will sit there

and sit there and sit there (I found it took 30 mins per item).

You will then take your disk home and find that the saved version

breaks off, mid-sentence, after 40% of whatever it is you wanted.

Nothing tells you 'Ha ha you thought you could download this stuff,

but you can't' while you are wasting your time in this way.  And

trying to copy large sections of texts with the mouse will also get

you nowhere slowly:  copy more than 8192 characters (why 8192? -

no, I don't want to know) and Dynatext (whose SGML software

Chadwyck- Healey use) will flash up a message saying that you have

tried to copy more text than it will allow you to and that it will

copy only 8192 characters of it.

<p>

It is of course quite reasonable for Chadwyck-Healey to protect

themselves against large-scale piracy, even by academics, those

notorious thieves of valuable data, from the sale of which, we all

know, they fund their cocaine habits.  But the program should warn

you of what it won't let you do.  And given that its software in

several crucial respects limits what can be done with its very

useful data it should give its users a chance to use what they need

- and what the UL has paid a lot for - in the way they need to use

it by saving it to disk.  I can't believe that enabling proper

downloads would effect the sales of a CD so expensive that it can

only be afforded by libraries.  None of the material is in

copyright, which is why the CD does not include a benchmark

contemporary edition:  why are we not permitted to use as much of

it as we like for the purposes of research?  Tell us,

Chadwyck-Healey, in a sentence which does not contain the word

'money'.

<p>

So it's great for collating plays, provided you don't want to

collate two quartos.  It's really valuable if you are working on

the growing area of the history of Shakespeare's theatrical

reception, provided you don't want more than 40% of an e-text of a

scarce adaptation to play with on your own.  The selection of

material to include seems to me to have been made with real

judiciousness (though why they use Q2 of Venus and Adonis

escapes me); it's the way the software divides it up that's the

main problem.  The CD is also probably the easiest way to do

searches on F1 and the early Quartos currently available, since

getting these from the Oxford Text Archive will involve giving up a

lot of disk space and spending a lot of time downloading and

searching.  The texts are, so far as my tests have gone, quite

accurate (though like many e-text transcribers its compositors

sometimes have a hard time accurately reproducing compositorial

errors and typographical oddities).  The front end has some

seriously annoying features which will limit its usefulness.

Chadwyck-Healey need to try out their versions of Dynatext on more

users before they release it:  to have good data which is presented

in a way that limits what you can do with it defeats the purpose of

hypertext editions, of which the chief advantage is near-infinite

flexibility.  The good news, though, is that Dynatext boasts that

it is more or less infinitely configurable by the companies who use

it to organise their SGML databases:  so I hope Chadwyck-Healey

will get reconfiguring, and produce an update of this software

which fits their users.  The CUP World Shakespeare Bibliography

uses Dynatext and is great:  fast, readily grasped by intuition,

and set out in a way that shows an intelligent awareness of how

academics want to work.

<p>

<cite>Note, May 1998</cite>

<p>

<cite>Since I wrote the above Chadwyck-Healey has modified the structure of the database in the online version so that the Folio volume includes not Benson but the early quartos of the poetical works. A small victory for CERES. Since I wrote it too the UL has upgraded the hardware used for accessing the CD ROM version of the database: it is no longer painfully slow to use. A small victory for progress, as we whigs call it.</cite>

<h2 align=center>STC ONLINE</h2>

<cite>Reviewed by Richard Serjeantson</cite>

<p>

<strong>The on-line ESTC (English Short-Title Catalogue) combines the Eighteenth Century STC, Pollard and Redgrave, and Wing. It is produced by RLG (Research Libraries Group) which sells subscriptions to individuals and institutions. The review which follows is of the telnet interface. For a review of the Web version see Harvest III.iii.</strong>

<p>

<strong>NATURE</strong><br>

The ESTC does not claim comprehensiveness, but rather states that

it lists 75,000 works printed before 1700 as well as the entire

18th century STC.  Having said this, I have not often been

disappointed when looking for a particular English work, although I

confess that I haven't been guddling around in newsbooks.  By its

nature, I think that it probably includes at least every work that

is in the - reasonably extensive - microfilm runs of STC and Wing

put out by University Microfilms International.

<p>

In fact, ESTC is something of a misnomer, since it is really not a

Short Title but rather a Full Title database, as may be seen from

the appended sample record.  The value of this over the printed STC

and Wing may easily be imagined: no longer does one find a

suggestive title cut off in its bibliographic prime.  This

comprehensiveness of detail is probably the best feature of the

on-line as opposed to the printed catalogues.

<p>

The on-line ESTC also gives publication details as these are listed

on the title page: i.e., Printed by  X for Y and are sold at Z.

Furthermore, in the case of anonymous publication, it gives the

name of the author when this is known.  Unfortunately, this is done

without distinguishing in the author field that the publication was

anonymous, although this is remarked upon in the notes.

Publication details are likewise expanded when they are known, and

marked thus (Wing H609):

'[Oxford] : Printed [by Henry Hall] for R. Royston at the Angel in

Ivy-lane [London], and R. Davis in Oxford, 1646.'

<p>

Each record also includes useful notes giving details about

relations between different impressions and editions, which it

seems to record reasonably faithfully.  This can, in my experience,

save an awful lot of time.  These notes also record details of

translations and of works included within the main one.  Finally,

formats are also given.

<p>

<strong>USE</strong><br>

The simplest way to use the catalogue is by browsing index lists,

either by name of author, or title, or subject.  This has the

advantage that one can (as it were) see the records on either side

of the one that one is seeking, thus easily tracking down variably

catalogued names or titles (which are in fact surprisingly rare).

It has the drawback that a search on 'Milton, John' will throw up

609 entries.  These can, however, be limited by, in particular,

date (i.e. 'limit date before 1650') which removes various

eighteenth-century mutilations of *Paradise Lost* (not to mention

the original editions) at a stroke.  For most authors, though, it

is a simple and sometimes instructive matter just to skim through

their entire printed oeuvre in search of the work one is seeking,

as one would with the printed  versions.

<p>

One can also search very easily on keywords--such as a particular

word or words within a title.  Furthermore, there is useful little

command ('like') that will extract various indexed details from the

record that one is  looking at and allows further searching on any

one of them.  This is most useful with respect to subject-headings:

many of the pre-1700 books have subject details according to the

Library of Congress system.  In general, I find these headings to

be distinctly blunt tools, but there is something to be said for

being able to track down at a stroke books on, say, 'Learning and

scholarship -- Early works to 1800' or even 'Episcopacy -- Early

works to 1800'.

<p>

The Eureka ESTC has a further useful little feature.  If you use a

bibliographic programme, such as the excellent Endnote from Niles

Associates [CERES Ed. note: information at website

http://www.niles.com/home/default.html which can lead you to a free

demo], you can instruct the catalogue to send you an email message

containing anything from one to fifty or so bibliographic records

in a format that will import simply and unproblematically into your

own citation database; a feature, to my mind, that is alone worth

the price of admission.

<p>

<strong>SHORTCOMINGS</strong><br>

Like its printed counter-parts, the on-line ESTC does not record

continental printed books unless they are written in English.

However, the Eureka organisation also maintains a separate and

rather remarkable consolidated catalogue of over 100 research

libraries that contains rather more than 22 million bibliographic

entries.  Not quite so swift of access, this catalogue - as well as

acting, in effect, as an almost complete list of modern printed

books - also has details of a large number of early-modern printed

books.  Although it is very far from being comprehensive for this

earlier period, I have nonetheless found that it can be helpful in

giving some idea of continental publications that I have tried to

track down.  It makes a passable stop-gap before we get round to

the on-line World STC of books printed before 1700.  Of course,

this same catalogue is also valuable for easily garnering

information about books published in later periods, too: who would

have thought that there were at least thirty-three editions (two of

which appear to have been pirates) of W.E.H. Lecky's _History of

the Rise and Influence of the Spirit of Rationalism in Europe_

(first publ. 1865) to 1955 in London and New York?  It seems

possible that subscription to the on-line ESTC would be accompanied

by access to this other catalogue.

<p>

Returning to the ESTC, it should be said that I haven't found a way

of searching by publisher or printer, although that is not to say

that there is not one that has escaped me.  Nor, interestingly

enough, does there seem to be a way of searching by Wing or STC

number.  This may seem strange to those used to the format of the

printed versions, but I would venture to suggest that even for

those accustomed to work using these, the on-line version will

offer ways round or even above this limitation.  It does, of

course, record Wing and STC numbers in the notes.

<p>

In one particular and obvious respect the on-line version is less

effective than the printed versions: one cannot scan whole pages at

a glance.

<p>

<strong>CONCLUSIONS</strong><br>

In a large number of respects, then, I have found this on-line STC

to be not just a good alternative to, but actually more useful than

its printed equivalents.  To members of subscribing institutions it

is free and freely available, at least in those parts of the

learned world that regard a hard-wired internet connection as the

indispensable scholarly accoutrement of every undergraduate,

graduate and faculty member.  One does not have to lay out

personally the hundreds of pounds required for the printed

versions, and hence one does not one have to do one's preliminary

bibliographic work tied to a library's reference room.

Furthermore, the on-line version even lists subscribing libraries

that hold copies of each work and their corresponding shelfmarks.

(Oxford college libraries seem to be better represented in this

than Cambridge ones.)  Perhaps even more usefully for those works

not to be found in the flesh at one's own institution, each record

lists the appropriate University Microfilm reference number, thus

removing the need to cross-refer to the STC, Wing, or Thomason

Tract indexes for this resource.  And there is, finally, rather

more information available about each book than may be found in the

printed versions.
