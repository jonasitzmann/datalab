HIRDLS is an extremely capable and versatile instrument, with the ability to make accurate and precise measurements of the
temperature and trace species from the mid-troposphere (under clear conditions) to the mesopause, that is, (8 to 80) km. It
will provide data that are relevant to a large number of scientific questions and investigations, some of which have not
yet been identified.
</p>
<p>
At this time, eight primary objectives have been identified as representative of important areas in which HIRDLS can make
critical contributions to the study of global change. They are related to the priorities of the US National Plan for the
Study of Global Change as stated in the Committee on Earth Sciences (CES) Report of May 1989. Here they are briefly stated;
they are discussed in greater detail in the HIRDLS Science Requirements Document.

<ol>
   <li> To understand the fluxes of mass and chemical constituents (including greenhouse gases and aerosols) that affect the
dynamics and composition of the troposphere, stratosphere, mesosphere, and thermosphere and link these regions together.
These fluxes must be determined down to smaller scales than previously observed.
   </li>
   <li> To understand the chemical processing, transport, and small-scale irreversible mixing of trace constituents in the
middle atmosphere, including the chemical and dynamical processes responsible for creating the Antarctic (and perhaps
Arctic) ozone holes.
   </li>
   <li> To understand the momentum, energy, and potential vorticity balances of the middle atmosphere, by extending
observations to smaller horizontal and vertical scales than has previously been possible. These small-scale processes are
believed to be fundamentally important to the determination of some large-scale characteristics and are thought to cause
irreversible chemical mixing.
   </li>
   <li> To obtain climatologies of upper tropospheric, stratospheric, and mesospheric quantities, in particular, profiles of
temperature, ozone, several radiatively active gases, aerosol, gravity wave activity, and cloud top heights. Seasonal,
interannual, and long-term trends will be obtainable because of the five-year measurement sequence that will be provided by
each EOS instrument, combined with pre-EOS measurements and future EOS observations.
   </li>
   <li> To provide data to validate and improve numerical models of the atmosphere, in order to gain confidence in their
ability to predict climate change. These simulations are critically dependent on the treatment of horizontal and vertical
scales that are much finer than those currently observed.
   </li>
   <li> To improve tropospheric temperature and water vapor profiles and cloud top height data that are used for climate and
weather forecasting, by combining high vertical resolution limb data with data from operational nadir sounders such as AIRS
and AMSU.  This will yield valuable data from the tropopause region and the lower stratosphere, information that would not
otherwise be available.
   </li>
   <li> To improve the understanding of tropospheric chemistry through the use of temperature and constituent retrievals that
extend in to the upper troposphere, under favorable conditions. The combination of these observations with observations from
other EOS instruments, and with chemical models, will yield information about the oxidation capacity of the atmosphere.
   </li>
   <li> To improve the understanding of stratospheric and tropospheric aerosols and clouds by acquiring long-term
high-resolution observations of their nature and distribution. Aerosols and polar stratospheric clouds are now known to
play essential roles in the depletion of ozone in the lower stratosphere, and subvisible cirrus clouds in the upper
troposphere significantly impact the radiative heating and cooling of the atmosphere.

   </li>

<p>
HIRDLS is an infrared limb-scanning radiometer designed to sound the upper troposphere, stratosphere, and mesosphere to
determine temperature; the concentrations of O3, H2O, CH4, N2O, NO2, HNO3, N2O5, CFC11, CFC12, and aerosols; and the
locations of polar stratospheric clouds and cloud tops. The goals are to provide sounding observations with horizontal and
vertical resolution superior to that previously obtained; to observe the lower stratosphere with improved sensitivity and
accuracy; and to improve understanding of atmospheric processes through data analysis, diagnostics, and use of two- and
three-dimensional models.
</p>
<p>
HIRDLS performs limb scans in the vertical at multiple azimuth angles, measuring infrared emissions in 21 channels ranging
from 6.12 to 17.76 mm. Four channels measure the emission by CO2. Taking advantage of the known mixing ratio of CO2, the
transmittance is calculated, and the equation of radiative transfer is inverted to determine the vertical distribution of
the Planck black body function, from which the temperature is derived as a function of pressure. Once the temperature
profile has been established, it is used to determine the Planck function profile for the trace gas channels. The measured
radiance and the Planck function profile are then used to determine the transmittance of each trace species and its mixing
ratio distribution.
</p>
<p>
Winds and potential vorticity are determined from spatial variations of the height of geopotential surfaces. These are
determined at upper levels by integrating the temperature profiles vertically from a known reference base. HIRDLS will
improve knowledge of data-sp arse regions by measuring the height variations of the reference surface provided by
conventional sources with the aid of a gyro pack age. This level (near the base of the stratosphere) can also be integrated
downward using nadir temperature soundings to improve trop ospheric analyses.
</p>
<p>
Overall science goals of HIRDLS are to observe the global distributions of temperature and several trace species in the
stratosphere and upper troposphere at high vertical and horizontal resolution. Specific issues to be investigated include:
<ul>
  <li>   Fluxes of mass and chemical constituents between the troposphere and stratosphere</li>
  <li>   Chemical processes, transport, and mixing by day and night(particularly in the lower stratosphere)</li>
  <li>   Momentum, energy, heat, and potential vorticity balances of the upper troposphere and middle atmosphere</li>
  <li>   Geographically and seasonally unbiased long-term climatologies and interannual variability of middle atmosphere 
temperature, constituents, dynamical fields, and gravity waves</li>
  <li>   Tropospheric cloud-top heights</li>
  <li>   Tropospheric temperature and water vapor retrievals (by providing high-resolution limb data for joint retrieval 
with 
EOS nadir sounders)</li>
   <li>  Diagnostic studies of atmospheric dynamics, chemistry, and transport processes to test and improve models of these 
processes.</li>
