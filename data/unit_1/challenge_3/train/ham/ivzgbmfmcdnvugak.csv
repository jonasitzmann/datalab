<h2 align=center>INTERNET RESOURCES</h2>

<p>

<strong>ONLINE TRANSLATOR</strong><br>

It's hard not to be excited by the thought of a web page which

can turn stilted English sentences into dazzling French, Italian,

Spanish, German, or Portuguese. Well, Altavista have exactly that

on their web site - a beta (trial) version of translation

software produced by the boffins at Systran.

<p>

There's a Press Release at <a href=http://altavista.digital.com/av/content/pr120997.htm> http://altavista.digital.com/av/content/pr120997.htm</a>. The Direct Translation Page is <a href=http://babelfish.altavista.digital.com/> http://babelfish.altavista.digital.com/</a>.

<p>

It doesn't yet seem to be available at any of Altavista's mirror

sites.

<p>

The service is cutely named after a creation of Douglas Adams's

Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy series.  The babelfish was a small

red fish which when placed in the outer ear would cause any speech

that passed through it to be translated into the language of the

ear's owner.  Altavista's service can deliver prose which looks a

bit like it's been swallowed by a red herring and has turned up on

your dinner plate, but it is a lot less ticklish than a fish in the

ear.

<p>

The facility is almost frighteningly good at humdrum epistolary

prose, such as you might want to send to French, German, Italian,

Portuguese, or Spanish libraries or academic institutions.  It

obviously can't cope with old spelling, so you will need to help it

out if you don't want some highly amusing creole to emerge:

<p>

Las! ne reverray-je plus ceste beaute parfaite,<br>

Donc me faudra il mourir sans esperer aucun secours?<br>

<cite>Mow! reverray I more ceste perfect beauty,<br>

Therefore will be necessary for me it to die without expecting any

help?</cite>

<p>

Like anything else working on one of today's mainframes, the

service operates at a speed you will not believe.  We have seen the

future and it employments.

<strong>THE SPACE OF THE STAGE</strong><br>

For an issue to be guest co-edited by Jeffrey Masten and Wendy

Wall, <cite>Renaissance Drama</cite> solicits essays that take up the question

of 'space' and the early modern stage. This topic could include:

the representation of space on stage; the representation of

particular kinds of spaces or locations, or geographic imaginaries

(domestic, urban, national, pastoral, undifferentiated space); the

space of acting/playing (e.g., locus/platea); the use of transit,

movement, exile, exit, entrance, procession; space as a created

effect or stage property; the space of the audience; the spaces of

staging outside theaters (the house, the court, etc.); the body

in/as theatrical space; the politics or ideologies of space and

particular spaces.  Deadline for submissions is March 15, 1998. Please send a

self-addressed stamped envelope (if you wish to have the essay

returned to you) and three copies of your essay to either of the

following addresses:<br>

<strong>WOMEN WRITERS 1500-1700</strong><br>

'Disrupting the Discourses: Women Writers 1500-1700', a one-day

conference at South Bank University, London, England, Friday 31st

July 1998.  This conference will explore women's writing across the genres,

1500-1700, taking as a starting point recent theoretical work on

the emergence of the woman author and the nature of the

relationship between women and texts.  We are particularly

interested in focusing on the manner in which women authors, having

constructed a voice for themselves, negotiated through their

writing such dominant discourses as religion, the family, marriage,

creativity, education, language, gender, sexuality, authority,

politics.  One-page proposals from both established scholars and those at the

beginning of their academic careers to be sent by 28th February

1998 to either M.J. Kidnie, School of Education, Politics, and

Social Science, South Bank University, 103 Borough Road, London,

England, SE1 0AA (e-mail: <a href=mailto:kidniem@sbu.ac.uk>kidniem@sbu.ac.uk</a>), or Rebecca D'Monte,

Department of Literature and Writing, University of Southampton New

College, The Avenue, Southampton, England, SO17 1BG.

1998. Contributions exploring European Anti-Aristotelianism in

natural philosophy, logic, ethics, and scholastic theology circa

Lipsius; 2) pre-Gassendi Epicureanism and atomic and corpuscular

theories (particularly Nicholas Hill and Daniel Sennert); 3)

Ramism; 4) cosmological Anti-Aristotelianism - Copernicus, Tycho,
