The Society has extensive book, journal, map, and photographic collections which are available to members. &nbsp; These collections are continually updated, and RSGS welcomes donations of relevant material. &nbsp; The collections are currently the subject of a two-year (2005-2007) Heritage-Lottery-funded "<a href="ifa/home.html">Images for All</a>" project to conserve them and improve their accessibility to the general public.
</p>
<br>
<h3><a href="books.htm">Book Collection</a></h3>
<p align=justify>
The book and journal collection of the RSGS is housed in a specially dedicated reading room in the <a href="http://www.lib.strath.ac.uk/">Andersonian Library</a> of the <a href="http://www.strath.ac.uk/">University of Strathclyde</a>, adjacent to the University's geography collection. &nbsp; Access to the collection is free to members of RSGS.
</p>
<p align=justify>
The collection comprises over 15,000 books and 3,000 volumes of journals together with 180 foreign language serials formerly housed in the <a href="http://www.nls.uk/">National Library of Scotland</a>. &nbsp; All material is accessible through the <a href="http://zen.lib.strath.ac.uk/">online catalogue</a> of the <a href="http://www.lib.strath.ac.uk/">Andersonian Library</a>, which can be accessed nationally and internationally via JANET (Joint Academic NETwork), OCLC, and the Internet.

<h3><a href="photocol.htm">Photographic Collections</a></h3>
<p align=justify>
The RSGS photographic collections comprise over 20,000 35mm colour slides of geographical subjects from around the world, over 8,000 antique glass lantern slides, many of which relate to past expeditions mounted by the Society, and a collection of historic photographs mainly of past officers of the Society. &nbsp; The collection is being catalogued, and selections may be transferred to CD-ROM. &nbsp; Some are already accessible through the <a href="http://www.scran.ac.uk/">Scottish Cultural Resources Access Network (SCRAN)</a> and the <a href="http://gdl.cdlr.strath.ac.uk/">Glasgow Digital Libraries (GDL) Project</a>.

The map collection comprises an historic collection of over 150,000 items, many of which were collected in association with RSGS expeditions. &nbsp; The collection is in the process of being catalogued. &nbsp; Antique maps from the collection have been deposited in the National Library of Scotland for conservation.
