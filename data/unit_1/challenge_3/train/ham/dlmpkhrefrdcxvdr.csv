			<P>All Key stage 1 and 2 schools in Brighton and Hove are&nbsp;now within the expanded Brighton and Hove School Sport Partnership. This organisation, funded by the Youth Sport Trust, has been expanded due to the success both nationally and locally of the scheme.</P>
<P>Each Primary phase school is grouped within a cluster of local schools that receive support and input from a trained SSCo (School Sports Co-ordinator) from their local secondary school. This teacher is given two days release time per week to work with colleagues in their cluster of schools.</P>
<P>Their role is to support these schools with providing high quality PE and School Sport both within and outside of the curriculum. This role will further be supported by a resource file which we anticipate will be with all schools by the end of October 2004.</P>
