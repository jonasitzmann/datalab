		<h2>HOW TO APPLY</h2><p>The GSA welcomes applications from and provides equal opportunity for talented students with artistic ambitions from all over the UK, Europe and the rest of the world. Put simply, if you have the creative talent and the determination to fulfil it, we want to hear from you.</p><p>Each programme has its own application procedure, but in practice, however, nearly all applications for full-time undergraduate study are made through UCAS (Universities Colleges Admissions Service). Information on how to apply is available from schools, colleges and careers offices or directly from UCAS: </p><p>UCAS <br />Rosehill<br />New Barn Lane <br />Cheltenham<br />Gloucestershire GL52 3LZ<br />+44 (0) 870 112 2211<br />enquiries@ucas.ac.uk<br />www.ucas.com</p><p>Applications can only be made online via the UCAS website.</p><p>For all postgraduate taught and research programmes, as well as part-time undergraduate programmes, applications should be made directly to the School. </p><p>The application procedure is essentially the same for international students although, if English is not your first language, you will be required to provide evidence of proficiency.</p><p>Of course, we would also like to see evidence of your creativity, so you will for most programmes be expected to submit a portfolio for consideration. Guidance notes on portfolio requirements, content and presentation are available on our website or from the Registry. </p><p>Selected applicants will be invited for interview as part of the application procedure (international students do not need to attend in person but must be available for telephone interviews). </p><p>Please note, at the time of publication the application procedures for the <br />BA (Hons) Design, BA (Hons) Fine Art and BArch (Hons) programmes are being reviewed. Please contact the Registry for current information on +44 (0) 141 353 4512 or registry@gsa.ac.uk</p><p>Key information for Applicants</p><h2>INTERVIEWS</h2><p>The interview provides you with the opportunity to demonstrate your commitment to your chosen area of study and to let us get an idea for your capacity for self motivation and independent study. It's very much a dialogue, so you'll have plenty of opportunity to ask questions. </p><p>Most, but not all, programmes require an interview before acceptance. International students however, will not be required to attend in person and may instead be interviewed by telephone.</p><p>Where an interview is not required, you will be given the opportunity to visit the school and to meet staff and students before you accept any offer of a place to join us.</p><h2>PORTFOLIOS</h2><p>Your portfolio of unaided work gives us a real insight into the creative potential you have. That's why it forms a crucial part of your application for most undergraduate and postgraduate programmes. The school's admissions guidelines will provide you with a general outline of portfolio requirements. You can get a copy from Registry or on our website www.gsa.ac.uk</p><h2>POSTGRADUATE PROGRAMMES </h2><p>You should apply directly to The Glasgow School of Art. For selected programmes you will be asked to submit a portfolio of recent work for assessment by an admissions panel. As with the undergraduate programmes, your portfolio is an integral part of your admissions procedure and should reveal a wide range of sustained visual interest and investigations.</p><h2>RESEARCH DEGREES</h2><p>To study for a research degree, you should have a Taught Masters as well as a First class or Upper Second class Honours degree in a field relevant to the proposed area of study. You will also be asked to submit an outline research proposal of between 500 and 1,000 words.</p><h2>PORTFOLIO COURSES</h2><p>Not everyone has the portfolio they believe they are capable of producing. <br />So if you would like to develop yours, you'll find our portfolio preparation courses invaluable. Offered under the School's Continuing Education Programme, our portfolio courses are designed to assist students in developing a portfolio for submission to art school or similar programme of study. They also help you develop your own working processes, centred on visual creativity. Attendance on a portfolio class does not guarantee acceptance to any art school or university degree programme or further education course. For more information, please contact the Continuing Education Department on +44 (0) 141 353 4596 or con-ed@gsa.ac.uk</p><h2>WIDENING ACCESS</h2><p>The Glasgow School of Art is committed to widening access to higher education and seeks to ensure equality of opportunity for all applicants. We believe access to a world-class education in art, design and architecture should be open to all based on talent, ability and potential.</p><h2>SCQF</h2><p>All Scottish qualifications have been collected into a single framework, known as the Scottish Credit and Qualifications Framework (SCQF). In line with this, all the GSA's undergraduate programmes have been allocated SCOTCAT Credits (120 per year) and European Credit and Transfer Scheme Credits (60 ECTS per year). Each undergraduate programme now has a range of exit awards:</p><p>year 1 (SCQF Level 7/SHE Level 1)<br />Certificate of Higher Education<br />year 2 (SCQF Level 8/SHE Level 2)<br />Diploma of Higher Education<br />year 3 (SCQF Level 9/SHE Level 3)<br />Ordinary Degree<br />year 4 (SCQF Level 10/SHE Level H)<br />Honours Degree<br />year 5 (SCQF Level 11/SHE Level M)<br />Integrated Masters Degree (First Degree)<br />Masters Degree (Postgraduate)</p><p>Postgraduate programmes have been assigned a total of 180 SCOTCAT credits, with a range of exit awards: <br />Postgraduate Certificate (PGCert)  <br />SCQF Level 11 (60 Credits)<br />Postgraduate Diploma (PGDip) <br />SCQF Level 11 (60 Credits)<br />Masters Degree  <br />SCQF Level 11 (60 Credits)<br />The MFA and MPhil 2D/3D Motion Graphics have been assigned a total of 240 SCOTCAT credits, with the following exit awards:<br />Postgraduate Certificate (PGCert)  <br />SCQF Level 11 (60 Credits)<br />Postgraduate Diploma (PGDip)  <br />SCQF Level 11 (60 Credits)<br />Masters Degree<br />SCQF Level 11 (120 Credits)<br />At the GSA, one Level is equal to one academic year (September to June) and our programmes within this prospectus are described in terms of academic years.</p><p>It is important to note that although the SCQF places qualifications and programmes of learning at the same level, this only indicates that they are broadly comparable in terms of the general level of outcomes. This does not mean that programmes offered at other institutions have the same purpose, content, or outcomes and equivalency of those offered at The Glasgow School of Art. General SCOTCAT credits can be used to assist student transfer between programmes. The Glasgow School of Art will decide on an individual basis the extent to which these credits are relevant to your programme of study and to the level of entry to your programme.</p><p>KEY CONTACTS<br />:GSA Registry <br />+44 (0) 141 353 4512<br />registry@gsa.ac.uk<br />:UCAS Enquiries <br />+44 (0) 870 112 2211<br />Minicom <br />+44 (0) 1242 544942<br />enquiries@ucas.ac.uk<br />www.ucas.com<br />:SCQF<br />www.scqf.org.uk</p><h2>POLICY TERMS + CONDITIONS</h2><p>The GSA has a range of publicly available policies covering: admissions, complaints procedure, widening access, quality assurance and enhancement, equal opportunities which are available <br />on our website www.gsa.ac.uk</p><h2>KEY INFORMATION FOR </h2><h2>INTERNATIONAL STUDENTS</h2><h2>PORTFOLIO</h2><p>For most programmes international students are required to submit a portfolio to the School; this may be in slide format. Full-time applicants should submit a minimum of 20 slides and include at least one sketchbook. Portfolios should be forwarded to the School at the earliest opportunity.</p><h2>VISAS</h2><p>All international students will need 'entry clearance' before being allowed to enter the United Kingdom. If you would like to study at the GSA, it is your responsibility to determine exactly what you will need once you have received an official offer letter from the School and well before your proposed departure date. </p><h2>FRESH TALENT</h2><p>The Fresh Talent Initiative offers undergraduate and postgraduate graduates from GSA the opportunity to remain and work in Scotland for a further two years following their studies. The Relocation Advisory Service based in Glasgow comprises a specialist team of advisors who offer comprehensive help and advice on this initiative. You can contact them at: info@scotlandistheplace or at: +44 (0) 141 248 2808. For more information about coming to Scotland to study and work, visit www.scotlandistheplace.com</p><h2>FINANCE</h2><p>Details of our tuition fees can be found on page 196. Students with citizenship of the United States of America should note that the GSA is registered with the Department of Education in Washington and students can apply for Federal Loans while studying full-time. The GSA's OPEID number is 02545700.</p><p>Study Abroad students may be eligible to have their financial aid transferred from their home college. Exchange students do not pay tuition fees to study at the GSA but continue to pay tuition fees to their home institution. EU students may be eligible for a Socrates grant from their home institution. You will need to finance your own travel, accommodation and living expenses while studying at the School and budget for field trips and materials. Information on materials costs can be found on page 197.</p><h2>EMPLOYMENT</h2><p>The UK has eased restrictions on international students taking paid employment and students are no longer required to obtain consent to take vacation work and part-time work while studying. This is also the same for work placements which are part of a 'sandwich course' and internship placements with an employer.</p><h2>HEALTH</h2><p>All full-time students from overseas have access to the National Health Service while studying at the School.</p><h2>STUDENTS FROM THE PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF CHINA </h2><p>Prospective undergraduate students wishing to study at the GSA can apply via CAFA, for the joint China Programme see page 131 (www.cafa.com.cn) or for any undergraduate programme via UCAS. Postgraduates should apply to The Glasgow School of Art.</p><h2>SCHOLARSHIPS </h2><p>The School offers many scholarship opportunities. Some of these are exclusively for full-time international students and include the GSA Governors Overseas Student Scholarship and the Tetsuya Mukai Scholarship.
