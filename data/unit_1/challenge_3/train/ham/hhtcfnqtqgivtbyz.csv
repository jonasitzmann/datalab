<p><b><i><font size="4"><a name="one">What is ozone, and why is it important?</a></i></b>

<p>Ozone is simply a molecule consisting of 3 oxygen atoms, which reacts strongly with other molecules. Ozone is created in the stratosphere when high energy uv radiation causes on O<sub>2</sub> molecule to split. The free oxygen atoms collide and react with other O<sub>2</sub> molecules to form O<sub>3</sub>.

<p>Production is highest where the solar uv is the greatest eg near the tropics, but once created, the ozone is then circulated towards the poles by the atmosphere. The amount of ozone in the stratosphere can vary with location, season and even day to day climatic conditions.

<p>The process of ozone creation is what makes the O<sub>3</sub> in the atmosphere very effective at shielding the Earth from harmful uv radiation, which can cause many biological problems, such as skin cancer. However, due to its high reactivity, the uv found in the tropospher at ground level can aslo be dangerous as a toxic pollutant which is harmful to plants and lung tissue, and is a major cause of smog.

<p>The main cause of ozone depleation in the stratosphere is reaction of the O<sub>3</sub> with man-made chemicals like chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) used in refridgerants, aerosol propellants and from industrial pollution. These CFCs rise into the stratosphere from Earth, and the chlorine is released through reaction with uv. This Cl then reacts with the highly unstable ozone, causing its depleation and subsequent problems on Earth.
The cooler climates of the Polar regions such as in Antarctica, leads to the formation of polar stratospheric clouds (PSCs) which contain small ice particles. These ice particles act as a catalyst for the Cl-O<sub>3</sub> reaction by providing a surface for the reaction to take place on. In the winter, PSC formation occurs readily, and come spring the clouds reamin, and so ozone depleation occurs readily.

<p>A hole appears over Antarctica every spring, lasting for 2 months before being swept away. More recently a hole has formed over the North Pole, and now ozone depleation has been recorded in all areas away from the Tropics. Since 1979 levels have fallen by an average of 5% every 10 yrs. In the middle latitudes, ozone levels have fallen by 10% in winter, and 5% in the summer.

The only way to reduce the spreading of the ozone hole is to stop producing the harmful CFC chemicals.
