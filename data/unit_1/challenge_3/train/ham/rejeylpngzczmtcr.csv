                          FAO: German A Level Students!</strong><br>
The  Hermann-Lietz-Schule, Haubinda,   Germany is  looking for young native English speakers (aged 18-24) to work for an academic  year as English Language Assistants, starting end of August 2007.<br>
Haubinda is a small,  rural boarding and day school for pupils aged from 7 to 18 with a special focus  on agriculture and practical work. More information about the school can be  found at <a href="http://www.lietz-schule.de/">www.haubinda.de</a> or <a href="http://www.haubinda.infobox4you.de/">www.haubinda.infobox4you.de</a><br>
We are looking for  people who aren&rsquo;t afraid of hard work and who enjoy working with young people.  The ability to speak at least intermediate German is important, too, although  language skills improve greatly over the year.<br>
This post would be  suitable for someone looking to take a year out before going to college/  university.<br>
Responsibilities of  the job include helping out in class and giving one-on-one lessons to weaker  pupils. You will mostly be working with pupils aged 14 to 18.<br>
Assistants play a  large role in the life of the school and are actively encouraged to take part  in extra-curricular activities, which range from sport to baking to metal-work  to choir. You should also be able and willing to offer at least one weekly  activity yourself.<br>
An allowance of 250  Euro a month is provided, which isn't too bad when you consider that  accommodation, all meals and extra-curricular activities including trips are  provided for free. Free onsite internet access is also available.<br>
Applications should  be sent by email to Kirsten Ehinger: <a href="mailto:haubinda@lietz-schule.de">haubinda@lietz-schule.de</a> (subject: Bewerbung als Fremdsprachenassistent)<br>
In this you should  describe your previous schooling, language skills, achievements, interests,  previous visits to Germany  (if relevant) and you should attach a recent photo (common practice in Germany). <br>
<strong>Closing date for  applications is 30 May 2007</strong>.<strong><br>

                          Onatti Theatre Company is now in its fifth year  of providing Foreign Language Productions for Secondary Schools.

&middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Is the funding  that Local Authorities receive ring-fenced? <br>
&middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Is the higher  cost of inner-city/rural LAs taken into account? <br>
&middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Is extra  funding available for primary languages through the Specialist Schools and Academies  Trust <br>
  (SSAT)? <br>
&middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  What is the  accountability of Specialist Language Colleges (SLCs) compared to LAs? <br>

The new suite of resources makes the case to   teachers, advisers, parents and learners (particularly teenagers) that Spanish   skills can make you more employable.<br>
                          The new Languages Work Spanish materials include   a factsheet, posters and webpages to provide advice, facts and real examples of   people using languages in their work to place language learning in context.   Materials are available to order free of charge via the Languages Work website <strong><A href="http://www.languageswork.org.uk/" target="_blank">www.languageswork.org.uk</A></strong>, which has also been updated to   coincide with the launch.<br>

                          Launch of the Languages Ladder<br>
                          </strong>This week sees the launch of the Languages Ladder, a new scheme which for the first time gives learners of all ages and all levels of ability a chance to measure their achievements in languages against a single grading system. The creation of the Languages Ladder takes forward a key recommendation of the Nuffield Inquiry - the establishment of a national standards framework for languages - and fulfils one of three overarching objectives of the Government's National Languages Strategy for England - to introduce a recognition system.The Languages Ladder uses 'can do' statements to measure learners' ability in the four main skills (reading, writing, speaking, listening) at three stages (Breakthrough, Preliminary and Intermediate). Within each stage are small steps leading to grades which can be awarded by a teacher in the classroom. For example, someone with Breakthrough Grade 1 speaking would state 'I can say/repeat a few words and short simple phrases'. Advanced, Proficiency and Mastery stages will be introduced in the future. The scheme encompasses primary, secondary and adult learners and is currently available in Chinese, French, German, Italian, Japanese, Punjabi, Spanish and Urdu, with an additional thirteen languages planned for 2006. Each skill area can be assessed separately, thus providing maximum flexibility as well as short-term motivational goals to encourage language learning.<br>
                          Linked to the Ladder are qualifications provided through the Asset Languages assessment scheme. This offers a combination of teacher and external assessment and will count towards schools' performance table scores.<br>

                      700 Reasons for Studying Languages<br>
                          </strong>The Subject Centre for Languages, Linguistics and Area Studies has recently conducted research into rationales for language learning, which has resulted in the production of a taxonomy of more than 700 reasons for studying languages. The collection of reasons are available as an online database which can be freely accessed from the Subject Centre website at <a href="http://www.llas.ac.uk/700reasons/orderform.aspx">www.llas.ac.uk/700reasons</a>. It is hoped that the 700 reasons will assist in the marketing of languages and in informing the design of future courses.
