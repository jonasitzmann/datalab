PROJECT</font></p>

<p>The High Resolution Dynamics Limb Sounder was launched on the Earth
Observing System Polar Chemistry satellite, known as 
<a href="mission/Aura_Brochure.pdf">EOS-Aura </a>
 on the 15th July 2004. HIRDLS
is an infrared limb scanning radiometer designed to sound the upper troposphere,
stratosphere, and mesosphere in order to measure temperature, geopotential
height gradients and concentrations of O<sub> 3</sub>, H<sub>2</sub>O, CH<sub>4</sub>,
N<sub>2</sub>O, NO<sub>2</sub>, HNO<sub>3</sub>, N<sub>2</sub>O<sub> 5</sub>,
ClONO<sub>2</sub>, CFCl<sub>2</sub>, CF<sub>2</sub>C<sub>2</sub>, aerosol
amounts, locations of polar stratospheric clouds and cloud top heights. The
goals are to make observations with horizontal and vertical resolution superior
to that previously obtained, to observe the lower stratosphere with improved
sensitivity and accuracy, and to use the data to improve understanding of
atmospheric processes through data analysis, diagnostics and the use of two- and
three-dimensional models.</p>
<p>The 
<a href="mission/Aura_Brochure.pdf">Aura </a>
satellite, which carries three other sounding instruments (TES, 
MLS and OMI) orbits the Earth in a sun-synchronous polar orbit at an alititude 
of about 705 km, which means one complete revolution of the Earth takes about 
105 minutes. The Earth rotates 'underneath' the spacecraft, so that full Earth 
coverage is obtained in about 12 hours.

<p align="left">HIRDLS was designed to obtain limb scans in the vertical at multiple azimuth angles
measuring infrared emissions in 21 channels ranging from 6.12 to 17.6Âµm and
defined by multilayer interference filters. Four channels measure the emission
by CO<sub>2</sub>. Utilising the known mixing ratio of CO<sub>2</sub>, the
transmission is calculated, and the equation of radiative transfer is inverted
to determine the vertical distribution of the Planck black body function, from
which the temperature is derived as a function of pressure. Once the temperature
profile has been established, it is used to determine the Planck function
profile for the trace gas channels. The measured radiances are then used to
determine the transmittance of each species, thence its mixing ratio
distribution. High vertical resolution will be obtained by using a 1 km vertical
field of view with multiple over sampling.</p>
<p>The measurement objectives are to observe the global distributions of
temperature and several trace species in the stratosphere and upper troposphere
at high vertical and horizontal resolution. The science goals using these data
include the determination of:</p>
<ul type="square">
  <li>Fluxes of mass and chemical constituents between the troposphere and
    stratosphere.
  <li>Chemical processing, transport and mixing, particularly in the lower
    stratosphere.
  <li>Momentum, energy and potential vorticity balances of the middle
    atmosphere.
  <li>Geographically and seasonally unbiased long-term climatologies and
    interannual variability of middle atmosphere temperature, constituents,
    dynamical fields and gravity waves.
  <li>Tropospheric cloud heights.
  <li>Tropospheric temperature and water vapour retrievals, possibly in
    conjunction with other EOS sounders.
  <li>Diagnostic studies of atmospheric dynamics, chemistry, and transport
    processes to test and improve models of these processes, especially at those
    smaller scales for which there are now no data to check the models' chemical
    or dynamical behaviour.
</ul>

<p align="left">This graph shows that stratospheric water vapour amounts are increasing at 1%
    per year which is more than is explained by CH<sub>4 </sub>increase. (Trends
    in water vapour observed above Colorado by balloon-borne frost point
    hygrometers from 1981-1997. Blue area is 95% confidence limit in trend.)<img border="0" src="images/dwater.jpg" align="left" width="166" height="19"></p>

  <li>HIRDLS is expected to advance our knowledge of the dynamics and
    circulation of the stratosphere, and its links with the troposphere, very
    significantly. It will elucidate processes which are a key part of the
    Earth's climate system.</li>
</ul>
    <p align="left">The instrument uses mechanical coolers of the Sitrling cycle type to 
    cool the detectors to 60 K.
    The total mass is about 170 Kg and the data rate 65 Kbits/sec. The
    optical entrance aperture is approximately 160 mm in diameter. Power
    consumption is approximately 200 W.</p>
    <p>The Project is joint between the U.S.A. and U.K. with the primary funding
    being provided by NASA and NERC in the two countries. The lead
    scientific/technical institutions are Colorado University and Oxford
    University where the joint Principal Investigators are located.</p>
