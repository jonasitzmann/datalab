All past lander missions to Mars, and most proposed missions, have carried
anemometers to measure wind speed &amp; direction near the surface. Oxford
UniversityÂ’s <a href="http://www.atm.ox.ac.uk/user/wilson/lpwt.html">Low
Density Wind Tunnel</a> (LDWT) is being used to create a facility in which
anemometers can be tested and calibrated in Martian surface conditions,
namely a carbon dioxide atmosphere at pressures of 5-10 mbar, temperatures
of 160-300 K, and flow speeds ranging from 0.5 m/s to 30 m/s. The
primary determination of wind speed is obtained from orifice plates
which measure the flow rate into the wind tunnel. The flow field is
characterised using a pitot tube on a translation stage. This
facility was developed for testing and calibration of a <a
href="http://www.atm.ox.ac.uk/user/wilson/B2WS/">wind sensor</a> for the
<a href="http://www.beagle2.com">Beagle2</a>
mission (2003), and may also be used to calibrate sensors for the <a
href="http://smsc.cnes.fr/NETLANDER/">NetLander</a>
mission (CNES, 2007).
<h2>
<u>Specifications:</u></h2>
Test section is circular, 180mm in diameter
<br>- Flow speeds achievable are 0.5 - 30 m/s.
<br>            (or 1-60 m/s using 120mm diameter nozzle)
<br>- Pressure is 5 - 10 mbar.
<br>- Gas used is CO<sub>2</sub> or dry air.
<br>- Airflow temperature can be set in the range 200K - 300K using the
proposed cooling system.
<br>
<br>- Absolute flowspeed accuracy is 3% of flowspeedfor all speeds > 1 m/s
<br>- Repeatability is better than 1% of flowspeed for all speeds > 1 m/s
<br>- Fluctuations in flowspeed are at most 0.3% of flowspeed

<p>This facility has been designed in collaboration with the wind tunnel
research group in Oxford University's <a href="http://www.eng.ox.ac.uk">Department
of Engineering Science</a>. It is located at the <a
href="http://www.osneylab.org.uk">Osney Laboratory</a>,
near the train station in Oxford.
