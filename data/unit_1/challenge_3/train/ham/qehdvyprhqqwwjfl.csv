<h2> A Spectral Model for Simulation of Tides in the Middle Atmosphere.

A linear spectral tidal model is developed for use in interpreting
satellite data for the middle atmosphere.  It allows for inclusion of
zonal-mean background winds and the parameterization of dissipation
processes.  In the companion papers (Wood and Andrews 1997 b,c), the
model is used to simulate diurnal and semidiurnal tides and comparisons
are made with other models and with observations.

We present calculations of the diurnal tide in the middle atmosphere
made using the spectral tidal model described in Wood and Andrews (1997a).  
The results are partly verified by comparisons with those from a
'classical' model for the case when background winds are absent. 
Calculations including the effects of background winds are compared
with previous models and with observations.  The convergence of the
numerical algorithms is checked by a number of sensitivity studies. A
method of dealing with certain singular matrices that appear in the
computation is described, as are experiments in which the tidal heating
rates and the zonal-mean wind fields are adjusted.

<h2>A Spectral Model for Simulation of Tides in the Middle Atmosphere.
III: Results for the Semidiurnal Tide</h2>

<h3>Andrew R Wood and David G Andrews</h3>

<p>
We present results for the semidiurnal tide in the middle atmosphere
calculated using the model described in Wood and Andrews (1997a).  As in 
Wood and Andrews (1997b),  results from this model are  compared with those
from a 'classical' model and with published model and observational
results. Sensitivity studies are performed to confirm the convergence
of the numerical calculations. The effects of mean winds and heating
rates on the monthly climatologies of the semidiurnal temperature tide
are briefly explored.
