<A NAME="intro"><P><h3>Introduction</h3></P>

<P>The low point of the year was undoubtedly the loss, just before orbital
insertion was due to take place, of the Mars Observer spacecraft, which carried
the Pressure Modulator Infrared Radiometer instrument on which the members of
the Department had lavished considerable effort and skill over a period of
nearly ten years. It is to be hoped that plans to refly the mission in 1996 or
1998 will be realised so that the outstanding science goals of PMIRR and the
other instruments may be realised, however belatedly.  <p>
On a more positive note, the ISAMS and NIMS experiments on the Upper Atmosphere
Research Satellite and Galileo Jupiter Orbiter spacecraft, respectively, were
very productive scientifically.  Some early results were reported in special
issues of the journals <i>Geophysical Research Letters</i> and <i>Planetary and
Space Science</i>.  <p>
The extensive building works which had disrupted the Atmospheric Physics
Laboratory for several years were completed, with the commissioning of the new
Space Instruments Laboratory, with clean room, vibration test facility and
extended satellite instrument test laboratory.  A new computing facility has
been introduced, featuring extensive ethernetworking, fast international data
links, and new workstations.  The new top-floor administrative suite was the
last part of the revamped building to be occupied, in January 1993.<p>
The subdepartment became a partner, with two other Oxford and one Cambridge
departments, in the newly-formed Smith Institute for Industrial Mathematics and
System Engineering which was formally opened by the Chancellor of the Duchy of
Lancaster.  The venture should lead to improved interactions between industry
and academia, in pure research endeavours of common interest which serve wealth
creation without compromising traditional academic values.<p>

<a name="earth"><P><h3>Earth Obervations</h3></P>

<i><p>
The Improved Stratospheric and Mesospheric Sounder on the Upper Atmosphere
Research Satellite.  </i>The Improved Stratospheric and Mesospheric Sounder
(ISAMS) which was launched in September 1991 produced about 180 days of very
valuable data which will continue to occupy us for some considerable time yet.
Validation has been of prime importance during this reporting period, but as
the results improve, we are moving more and more towards scientific studies of
the data.  The data from version 8 of the processing suite is now complete, and
has been placed in the public archives at the RAL Geophysical Data Facility and
at the Goddard Space Flight Center DAAC.   Work will continue on data
validation, and future improvements will be made available to data users from
time to time.  Version 9 is being processed at GSFC, and should be available
for public use in the spring of 1994.  Version 10 is expected to feature (i)
improved treatment of volcanic aerosol, which affects constituent profiles
below the 10 mb level, (ii) detailed formulation of non-equilibrium emission,
especially in water vapour, carbon monoxide and ozone, (iii) retrieval of
nitric oxide and nitrogen pentoxide and (iv) improved detection of clouds at
the bottom of the scan, as well as a host of miscellaneous other improvements.
<p>
<p>
Work published and in preparation includes studies of  atmospheric tides,
showing reasonable agreement with theoretical tidal models; the transport of
long-lived tracers by the middle atmosphere circulation, from which we are
learning a great deal about the general circulation of the middle atmosphere;
the spectral response, composition and transport of volcanic aerosol from Mt
Pinatubo; the detection of polar stratospheric clouds from their spectral
properties, and their formation and dissipation; the behaviour of nitrogen
dioxide in the winter polar regions, showing the joint effects of dynamics and
chemistry generating the `Noxon Cliff' and allowing the question of transport
and chemistry in the NOx family to be comprehensively investigated for the
first time; the polar night enhancement of mesospheric and stratospheric carbon
monoxide, due to descent of air from the upper mesosphere into the polar
vortex;  and thermospheric emission from nitric oxide and its enhancement at
times of solar flares.  <p>
<p>
Work is continuing on elucidating further details of all of the above, and in
many other areas. The temperature data is being studied for evidence of gravity
waves, to identify regions of high wave activity, and their possible connection
with lower atmospheric forcing.  Nitric acid shows interesting behaviour, which
is not yet understood,  both in the polar vortex and in intrusions of low
latitude air into the polar vortex.  The latest nitrogen pentoxide retrievals
look sensible, but do not vary with solar zenith angle in  the way expected
from model predictions.  <p>
<p>
ISAMS data has been made good use of by other investigators in the UARS
community, and its use worldwide is expected to increase considerably now that
the data is in the public domain.<p>
<i><p>
The Along Track Scanning Radiometers on ERS-1 and ERS-2. </i>The<i> </i>thermal
vacuum testing and scientific calibration of the second ATSR was completed, and
the instrument delivered to ESA for a 1994 launch. Parameters measured during a
programme of precise thermometry and radiometry using precision blackbodies
were field of view, thermal balance during an orbital simulation, and spectral
and radiometric gains.  Scientific work with ATSR data at Oxford is focusing on
determining global cloud properties.<p>
<i><p>
The EURECA Occultation Radiometer on the ESA European Retrievable Carrier:
</i>Preliminary water vapour retrievals show layers in the vertical profiles,
with lower than expected concentrations near 50km. The monthly means show a dry
'hole' at high latitudes.<p>
<i><p>
Measurements of Pollution in the Troposphere: an experiment for the NASA EOS
AM-1 Platform (1998):  </i>Work is being carried out on the thermal design and
optics layout for MOPITT, including the detailed design of pressure modulators
to be built at Oxford. Plans are being developed for an aircraft version to be
flown on a Jetstream aircraft at Cranfield.<i><p>
<p>
High Resolution Infrared Dynamics Limb Sounder for the NASA Earth Observing
System. </i> The HIRDLS instrument is an infra red limb sounder which will
measure temperature, pressure and the concentrations of ten minor constituents
concerned with the chemistry and radiation in the stratosphere and mesosphere.
The instrument will be able to view at a large range of azimuth angles, and
this will provide vertical profiles at a much closer spacing in longitude than
previously obtained by limb sounders.  The typical resolution will be 1 km
vertically by about 400 km horizontally.  The project is joint between SERC and
NASA with NCAR taking the lead in the USA and Oxford University taking the
scientific and technical lead in the UK.  Reading University, the Rutherford
Appleton Laboratory and Matra Marconi Space (UK) Ltd are also involved in the
UK.  Considerable progress has been made on defining the system requirements
for the instrument; an internal requirements review was held at NCAR in January
1993 and a System Requirements Review will be held at Goddard Space Flight
Center in December 1993.  Some changes have been made in the division of work
between the UK and USA during the last year, notably moving the building of the
telescope subsystem including the optical bench to the USA.  Work at Oxford has
taken place particularly in the areas of system engineering, design of the
calibration facility, the pointing system and the ground support equipment, and
of modelling the solar illumination geometry and sun shield requirements.  The
instrument was originally selected for a 1998 launch, but is now scheduled for
2002 on the NASA EOS Chem satellite.  Atmospheric chlorine is predicted to peak
in about 2005, when HIRDLS should be operating.<i><p>
<p>
Other activities: </i>The space data management group produced a final report
detailing how data from 3000 tapes and tonnes of paper had been placed on 35
optical discs, documented and catalogued. Scientific work with satellite data
accumulated over more than twenty years makes trend analysis possible once
problems with different observing wavelengths, weighting functions, and
calibration targets, have been addressed.  Meanwhile, ISAMS temperature and
volcanic plume observations are being compared to historic Nimbus data, and
plans to re-retrieve Nimbus 4,5,6 and 7 temperatures from the radiance data
considered.<p>
<p>
New models of heating and cooling processes in the mesosphere involving the
deactivation of CO2 by atomic oxygen O(3P) have been
developed from satellite data.  The results could explain the improbably low
thermospheric temperatures found in the atmospheres of Mars and Venus, and
require an extra source of heating - possibly associated with gravity waves -
in energy balance models of the Earth's mesosphere.  <p>
<p>
The 'GENLN2' radiative transfer code is being further developed with colleagues
in the USA.  New features include treatment of line mixing, including heavy
molecule cross-sections from lab measurements, improved empirical water vapour
continuum treatment, and inclusion of aerosol extinction. Applications include
producing transmission functions for ISAMS and EOR, testing band models used in
fast retrieval schemes, testing the multiplicative properties of overlapping
gas transmissions, and comparisons with similar codes developed elsewhere.<p>

<a name="atmos"><P><h3>Middle Atmosphere Dynamics</h3></P>

<p>
The middle atmosphere modelling group is using a range of numerical models of
the fluid dynamics, radiative transfer and chemical transport in the
stratosphere and mesosphere, with the aim of interpreting the data from the
ISAMS instrument.<p>
<p>
A first step has been to use our dynamical diagnostic package, MADPO, to
examine in some detail the evolution of the temperature and winds in the
stratosphere and lower mesosphere during the northern winter of 1991-92.  A
variety of interesting dynamical features are revealed, including the migration
and splitting of the zonal-mean jets and several periods of stratospheric
warming, culminating in a near-major warming in January 1992.  Tracer fields,
especially N2O, have also been studied; these provide valuable evidence of the
transport characteristics of the stratosphere during this period.<p>
<p>
A series of experiments is in progress using a middle-atmosphere version of the
sophisticated general circulation model developed by the Universities' Global
Atmospheric Modelling Programme, in which we participate.  The model has been
run to simulate the 1991-92 winter and beyond, starting on 9 November 1991 with
dynamical fields from the European Centre for Medium-range Weather Forecasts
below 10 hPa, and temperature, wind and chemical tracer fields of N2O, CH4 and
aerosol derived from ISAMS measurements above 10 hPa. Also included in the
model are several thousand particles initialized on 8 levels to give an
indication of typical air parcel trajectories. Some of these runs have produced
zonal mean winds which compare quite well with winds derived from ISAMS
temperatures.  They also produce other realistic features: descent of
mesospheric air into the winter polar stratosphere, a fairly persistent
wave-one disturbance on the vortex in the low and middle stratosphere, and
tongues of N2O and potential vorticity similar to those found by ISAMS.  In
addition, they capture some features of the change in zonal mean N2O and CH4
observed by ISAMS.<p>
<p>
Developments of the `contour advection' modelling technique have been made.
This very accurate technique reveals the ultra-fine-scale structure in
isentropic tracer transport. It has been applied to the transport of chemically
activated air out of the polar vortex, to the break-up of the polar vortex as
revealed by ISAMS aerosol, and to stratosphere-troposphere exchange.<p>
<p>
We have extracted large-scale sun-synchronous motions in the middle atmosphere
with diurnal and semi-diurnal periods from the ISAMS temperature data.   These
motions may be interpreted in terms of atmospheric tides, and we have started
to compare them with a detailed numerical tidal model of the stratosphere and
mesosphere, with encouraging results so far.<p>
<p>
Other projects include a collaboration with the Meteorological Office in which
the particle-trajectory method described above is studied in great detail in a
middle-atmosphere model of intermediate complexity. Another intermediate model
is being used to investigate the propagation characteristics of non-linear
planetary-scale Rossby waves in idealised situations, to help our understanding
of disturbances of this kind observed in our satellite data. <p>

<a name="plan"><P><h3>Planetary Experiments</h3></P>

<p>
As noted above, the loss of the Mars Observer spacecraft was a major blow; a
large part of the Pressure Modulator Infrared Radiometer (PMIRR) experiment was
built in Oxford and the concept was based upon the stratospheric limb sounders
developed in the Department.  Data reduction algorithms were in place and a two
dimensional water transportation model for interpretation of the PMIRR water
measurements was under development.  This utilises dynamical information from
measurements or from circulation models existing in Oxford or elsewhere and
uses an advection scheme to model the water transport and parameterisation of
the physical processes involved in adsorption, desorption, diffusion,
sublimation and condensation of water at the surface and throughout the
atmosphere.  Work on this model will continue at a low level in the hope that
measurements will be obtained later this decade from a rebuilt PMIRR using the
spare parts which exist for most of the instrument.<p>
<p>
Data analysis activities are now centred around preparation for receipt of data
from the Near Infrared Mapping Spectrometer (NIMS) on Galileo when it reaches
Jupiter in December 1995.  The instrument is a grating spectrometer covering
the wavelength range 0.7 to 5.2 micron using a scanning secondary mirror and
motion of the scan platform to build up images for which each pixel is a
spectrum.  The spacecraft flew past Venus in February 1990, returning the data
to Earth later that year.  The analysis of these data has been highly
successful (see publications).  The NIMS results yielded new information on the
cloud structure and its distribution as well as unique soundings of the deep
atmosphere in atmospheric transmission windows which were not known to exist
until recently.  The spacecraft's main antenna remains partly closed but by
data selection and compression, we still expect to obtain a significant volume
of measurements and good scientific results.  Observations are planned which
will allow us to measure atmospheric minor constituent abundances in the deep
atmosphere and to investigate the vertical distribution of the Jovian clouds
for a wide range of regions representative of the features discovered on
Jupiter during the Pioneer and Voyager missions.<p>
<p>
The group's hardware efforts are directed towards the development of the
radiative cooler and focal plane assembly for the Composite InfraRed
Spectrometer (CIRS) experiment on the Cassini mission to Saturn.  The
development effort is now nearing completion and fabrication of the flight
parts is expected to start in early 1994 for a launch in 1997.  The CIRS
instrument, being built in collaboration with NASA Goddard Space Flight Center
and CEN/Saclay in France, is an advanced version of the IRIS spectrometer which
performed excellently on the Voyager spacecraft.  The new instrument has a
wider wavelength range (7 micron - 1000micron), plus better spatial and
spectral resolutions, made possible by the use of the cooled focal plane.  The
instrument will measure the temperature structure of the atmospheres of Saturn
and Titan as well as detecting and mapping minor constituents in both
atmospheres.<p>
<p>
Work has begun on building a prototype of a small instrument intended for the
NASA Pluto fast flyby mission.  This mission is currently in a study phase and
the instrument is a simple near infrared spectrometer being developed again in
collaboration with the Goddard Space Flight Center since much of the design is
based directly on the cooler being developed in Oxford for CIRS.<p>
<p>
Evaluation of novel silicon pressure sensors for use in the low pressure
regimes on the Martian surface has recently started.  The devices were designed
as a student project and fabrication of the first sensors has just been
completed by industrial collaborators.  Instruments based on these may be used
in meteorological stations forming part of the ESA Marsnet or NASA MESUR
networks.<p>
<p>
Work has also continued on development of bolometric detectors based upon high
temperature superconductors.  These detectors will give improved noise
performance over room temperature devices for wavelengths above 20micron.
Detectors have been fabricated and shown to have a bolometric response and our
efforts are now directed to producing a low thermal mass, and thus low time
constant, detector with low noise suitable for space use.<p>

<a name="gpfd"><P><h3>Geophysical and Planetary Fluid Dynamics</h3></P>

<p>
A laboratory investigation was completed of baroclinic waves in an
internally-heated fluid in cylindrical containers with sloping boundaries, such
that the depth of the system varied with radius.  Coherent baroclinic eddies
were found which were analogous to those earlier found by Read and Hide in the
context of a proposed laboratory analogue of long-lived vortices in the major
planets, but were highly dispersive in their azimuthal propagation.  Some
evidence for the formation of multiple zonal jets were also found at high
rotation rates, though such jets were strongly confined in the vertical and may
occur even in the absence of a radial depth gradient, in contrast to
predictions from widely-accepted theoretical ideas based on potential vorticity
dynamics.<p>
<p>
A combined laboratory and numerical modelling study of transitions to chaotic
behaviour in a thermally-driven rotating annulus was completed, using
much-improved apparatus and instrumentation over previous work.  Encouraging
agreement was found between results from laboratory experiments on transitions
from highly stable, single-wavenumber states to more complex, chaotically
modulated multiple-wavenumber states and highly-truncated spectral models which
represent the non-linear interaction of only a small number of wavenumber
modes.  Both experiments and models appear to show similar transition sequences
provided (a) the model includes at least the dominant wavenumber mode and its
sidebands and long wave, and (b) the wave pattern drifts with respect to the
apparatus in the experiment.  A follow-on project to this work is now under
way.<p>
<p>
Two projects have continued with the aim of improving the direct numerical
simulation of flow systems realisable in the laboratory.  Recent attempts to
simulate baroclinic wave flows using a fully three-dimensional time-dependent
numerical model, based on the Navier-Stokes equations in cylindrical geometry,
have shown encouraging agreement with detailed laboratory measurements for the
simpler single-wavenumber regimes, though more complex time-dependent flows
were less successfully simulated.  In these cases, it was suspected that the
advection scheme in the original model needed improvement.  Two separate new
approaches are under current investigation.<p>
<p>
A feasibility study was completed of the application of control-volume
finite-element methods to the simulation of baroclinic flows, and showed some
encouraging results for some simple test cases, though a number of practical
problems in the implementation of this method (especially relating to solving
for the pressure field) remain to be satisfactorily overcome.  In a new
project, the group has begun to implement a semi-Lagrangian advection scheme in
their 3-D Navier-Stokes model.  Such schemes are currently under consideration
by the Meteorological Office for use in their next generation of weather and
climate models, because of the accuracy and computational economy claimed for
the latter over more conventional Eulerian methods.  They do not satisfy formal
conservation of heat and momentum, however, and it is hoped with the present
project to evaluate some of the implications of imperfect conservation and more
general aspects of the scheme's performance by direct comparison of simulations
with laboratory measurements.<p>
<p>
Results from a numerical modelling study of equatorial planetary waves in the
atmospheres of the Earth and Jupiter, and their interaction with zonal flows,
indicate an important role for the breaking of equatorial Kelvin and Mixed
Rossby-Gravity waves in the Quasi-Biennial Oscillation (QBO) observed in the
Earth's stratosphere.  A new model has also been developed which simulates a
mechanism comparable to that of the QBO for the so-called Quasi-Quadrennial
Oscillation (an oscillation with a period around 4 Earth years) recently
discovered in the atmosphere of Jupiter.  Some aspects of this model may be
amenable to observational tests during the Galileo mission to Jupiter.<p>
<p>
Work has progressed on two modelling projects relating to the Martian
atmosphere.  The first of these has entailed the development of a simplified
'reduced physics' circulation model of the Martian atmosphere (the Mars Simple
General Circulation Model, or MSGCM).  This is based on a semi-spectral
primitive equations model originally developed for modelling the Earth's
atmosphere at Reading University, which has been used to study dynamical
process relating to baroclinic waves and the effect of the very large amplitude
surface topography of Mars on its atmosphere. Recent process studies have
investigated the generation of large-scale stationary waves in the atmosphere
by major topographic features such as the Tharsis Plateau and the Hellas Basin.
By using finer spatial resolution in the MSGCM than has been feasible hitherto
with other more complex models of the Mars atmosphere, it has also been
possible to study smaller scale features linked to surface topography.  In
particular, cross-equatorial flow in the main Hadley circulation occurring
under solstice conditions is found to be concentrated into two strong low-level
jets on the east-facing slopes of the two major topographic features at that
latitude.  The strength of the jets depends strongly on the effect of surface
drag, but it is of interest that the locations of the strongest winds in the
model are close to regions which have been associated with the generation of
large-scale dust storms.<p>
<p>
A project was begun to develop a more detailed model of the Martian atmosphere
including a scheme for assimilating spacecraft observations, as a means of
analysing and interpreting asynchronous observations in an optimum way,
analogous to the approach in current operational use for terrestrial numerical
weather prediction.  This work is being continued in the expectation that a
replacement Mars Observer mission may yet return a substantial set of
meteorological data for the atmosphere of Mars, principally in the form of
thermal infrared soundings from the Pressure Modulator Infrared Radiometer.
This model is being produced by extending the MSGCM described above, including
more complex parameterisations of the boundary layer, dry convection, soil
diffusion and drag as a result of gravity wave breaking.  The radiation scheme
is being developed with Laboratoire de M&eacute;t&eacute;orologie Dynamique,
Paris, and refinements to include the effects of non-local thermodynamic
equilibrium with colleagues from Instituto de Astrofisica de Andalucia,
Granada, Spain.  Schemes for dust transport, later to be coupled with the
radiation scheme, polar mass and heat balance and possibly the effects of polar
clouds are planned for the near future.<p>

The data assimilation procedure uses a modified form of the Analysis Correction
Scheme which is in current operational use at the Met. Office.  This scheme is
an approximation to the optimal interpolation analysis which involves a form of
successive-correction iterated between each time step of the model.  Continuous
(asynoptic) repeated insertion is conducted sequentially, assimilating each
measurement at the time and place it is valid without prior interpolation.
Observational increments to the model are spread in time and space by
empirically-determined functions with scales and weights which depend on the
relative errors in observations and the model forecast and on the difference
between the current model time and the time at which the data is valid.
Typical output from the assimilation comprises self-consistent fields as
represented in the model (velocity, temperature and surface pressure) stored at
regular intervals from which derived quantities and diagnostics (potential
vorticity, energy budgets, transport of heat, momentum and material tracers,
Eliassen-Palm fluxes etc.) may be calculated and which may be used, for
example, as initial states for further independent model studies.  Preliminary
trials of the scheme have so far been conducted using synthetic data generated
from parallel model runs.  <p>

Work has continued on simulating and predicting the ENSO (El
Ni&ntilde;o/Southern Oscillation) phenomenon, the dominant mode of interannual
variability in the tropics.  Several kinds of prediction schemes have been
developed and significant predictions at lead times of 6-12 months have been
achieved, although there are still a variety of open questions to explore, such
as the selection of best predictors, the dependence of predictability on
initial conditions and the spatial distribution of the skill of different
models.  We have addressed the topic of best predictors in the context of
statistical predictive schemes and dynamical coupled models.  The statistical
predictions are based on a POP scheme, which can identify cyclic features in
the analysed field.  It has been used  to compare the predictive skill of
different variables, such as the SST or heat content (HC) and to explore to
what extent the predictability of the ENSO depends on the phase of its cycle.
Dynamical predictions  are carried out using various ocean models coupled to an
empirical atmosphere, deduced by advanced statistical techniques, with the
atmospheric response assumed to be in equilibrium with the ocean.  Both
statistical and dynamical schemes have  significant predictive skill of some
index of ENSO at lead times of around one year.<p>
<p>
The POP scheme gives better results in predicting the observed <i>SST</i>
anomalies when using  HC instead of SST as predictors, which suggests the
importance of HC in the maintenance of the ENSO cycle.  The transition phase of
ENSO is predicted better than the peak phase, but this needs farther
investigation.  For the dynamical system the best skill, above 0.5 up to 18
months, is achieved when the atmosphere responds to changes in SST and HC
simultaneously.  It improves considerably (0.8 at 18 months) when predicting
periods dominated by ENSO variability.  The dynamical predictions show a strong
seasonal dependence, with spring and summer being the seasons most difficult to
predict, although the skill often recovers after the decay in these seasons,
leading to successful predictions for the following seasons.<p>

The initial state of the ocean from which climate forecasts are made is
obtained in large part from the history of the surface wind stress.  Obtaining
accurate winds over the ocean is difficult, but work is in progress with ECMWF
and Pacific Marine Environmental Lab (PMEL) to evaluate winds products derived
from the scatterometer on ERS1 and the TAO array, a comprehensive set of
moorings which monitor both wind and upper ocean thermal structure in the
tropical Pacific ocean.  High quality wind fields are now obtainable from the
scatterometer, and the impact of these winds on the ECMWF analysis is currently
being evaluated.  Because the data are single level, surface data, they do not
have as much impact on the analysis system, as might be desired.  A similar
result is true for the TAO wind data.<p>
<p>
One way of validating the ECMWF winds is to use them to force ocean models.  A
model of the tropical Pacific (a medium-resolution GCM) was forced with wind
data from the ECMWF analyses for the period covered by the ERS-1 mission
(August 1991 to present).  One aim of this work was to compare model results
with SST data from the Along-track Scanning Radiometer (ATSR).  Results of a
simulation of the decline and re-occurrence of the 1991-92 El Ni&ntilde;o event
were studied.  A propagating signal of about 35 day period was present in the
model results which compares favourably with the ATSR observations and is
considered to be a Legeckis-wave type instability.  A second objective was to
compare the ocean model results with observations from the TAO array and a
third to compare the results of the model SST produced by forcing with ECMWF
wind stresses with those obtained from the Florida State University wind
product.  This comparison shows that there are significant differences in the
results of up to 3 degC.  Such errors present in the initial
conditions used in the coupled model, degrade the forecast and may account for
the fact that the re-warming of the tropical Pacific ocean in 1993 was not
consistently forecast by the coupled model.<p>
<p>
The combination of satellite altimeter data with a dynamical model of the
Tropical Pacific Ocean has been carried out using a four-dimensional
variational technique.  Of particular interest, is the potential for a time
sequence of altimeter data (ie, sea surface height) to constrain the subsurface
fields in a multi-layer system.  One year assimilation experiments using
simulated observations indicate that vertical propagation of the surface
information is particularly effective within the equatorial region; fast
equatorially trapped waves provide the mechanism for propagating this
information to depth.  At higher latitudes, where baroclinic Rossby wave
propagation is much slower, the assimilation has far less of an impact,
suggesting that additional (subsurface) data are required.<p>
<p>
Work is in progress to set up a coupled ocean-atmosphere model to study
interdecadal variations in the global climate.  The model being developed is
complex enough to represent relevant physical processes but simple enough to
allow many integrations of duration of 100 years.  The ocean model simulates
the basic three dimensional circulation, including thermohaline overturning,
and the atmospheric model simulates the troposphere and its response to SST
anomalies, including teleconnections between low and high latitudes.<p>

This research continues to focus on the application of ideas from
finite-dimensional dynamical systems to rotating fluid flows, especially
between concentric rotating cylinders (the Taylor-Couette problem).  We have
investigated the dependence of the so-called anomalous modes on the radius
ratio of the cylinders using both experimental and numerical techniques.  High
sensitivity to this geometrical parameter was found and this explains the
previously reported differences found in the narrow and wide gap limits of the
problem.  Other current research activities include the transition to
turbulence in a pipe, electrically induced instabilities in nematic liquid
crystals, convection in molten gallium, the irregular motion of vibrating beams
and non-linear signal processing applied to time series from distributed
sources.<p>
<p>
A review of the combined experimental and theoretical approach used in our
research and a more detailed discussion of observations of chaos in fluid
mechanical problems, where the discourse has been extended to include both open
and closed recirculating flows, have been prepared (see publications).  New
results have been reported on a generalised rotating flow where both low and
high-dimensional dynamics are found to coexist at the same parameter values.<p>
<p>
Novel hydrodynamic instabilities have been found in the flow of a nematic
liquid crystal under the action of oscillatory shear.  As yet the comparison
between theory and experiment remains qualitative as certain crucial material
parameters are unknown.  However, the general trend of the results has been
satisfactorily predicted and there is good agreement in some of the details
such as the wavelength of the instability.  Finally, we have investigated the
stability of inverted multiple pendulums under parametric excitation.  It has
been shown that up to three such connected pendulums can be stabilised and very
good agreement has been found between theory and experiment.  There does,
however remain an enigma in that the pendulums ought to be linearly unstable in
certain parameter ranges and yet they are observed experimentally to be stable.
