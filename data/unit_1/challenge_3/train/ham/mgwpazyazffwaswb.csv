<h2>Structural Modifications to AOPP</h2>

<p>The building, originally known as <a
href="../dept/history.html">Old
Zooology</a>, has been extensively modified over the past 20 years to
accommodate both the needs of a growing department and the facilities
required for developing and testing space instrumentation. To this end
a completely new floor has been added to house the group studying
planetary atmospheres, and several new cleanrooms installed on the
ground floor.</p>

<p>The driving force behind the re-modelling and updating has always
been the science objectives pursued by the various groups, but
inevitably the trend has always been towards facilities of a higher
specification to reflect the changing requirements for assembly,
integration and test of flight hardware. This has been true for both
planetary and earth observation experiments with the <a
href="clean_assembly_area.html">Clean Assembly Area</a> being
constructed in 1991 to provide the cleanroom and thermal vacuum test
facilities needed to development the <a
href="../capabilities/passive_coolers.html">passive cooler</a> for the <a
href="../planetary/cirs.html">Composite
Infrared Spectrometer (CIRS)</a>. The <a
href="2point2_metre_facility/index.html">HIRDLS Test and
Calibration Facility</a> required extensive ground works, Fig 1, to
form the sub-floor service pit needed to accommodate the <a
href="2point2_metre_facility/mass_3.html">seismic block</a>,
Fig 2 and Fig 3.  The cleanroom was subsequently constructed around
the installed vacuum chamber which was then fitted out with
environment and calibration test equipment. The building works were
started in May 1997, and the HIRDLS proto-flight model calibrated
between August and December 2002.
