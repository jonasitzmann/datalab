		<p>Welcome to the Mackintosh School of Architecture, an international school rooted in Glasgow - Britain's only true Victorian gridiron city with 19th century buildings to rival Chicago.</p><p>Architecture has been taught at the GSA from the middle of the 19th century and the School boasts Charles Rennie Mackintosh and two of Glasgow's most notable modern architects, Andy MacMillan and Isi Metzstein of the postwar architectural practice Gillespie Kidd and Coia, amongst its most eminent alumni.  In a recent survey by the Architects' Journal (2006) the Mac was ranked by the profession as the best architecture school in Scotland and third in the UK.</p><p>Our approach to research and teaching is fundamentally simple - we care about how buildings and places are made and used and this deep concern is reflected in the design reputation of the School - for aesthetically and intellectually rigorous architecture set in a social and urban context.</p><p>At the Mackintosh School of Architecture, the emphasis is on student-centred active learning, which means being involved in a wide range of experiences and exercises. Students are encouraged to develop their own direction and solutions, imaginatively and creatively, through set studio design projects, supported by full-time studio tutors and leading practitioners.</p><p>Many schools of architecture claim to balance art with science - we do this by being part of a creative hothouse of artists, designers and architects that comprise the GSA. </p>
	

	

	

	

	

	

	
	
	
	
	


	
	





	<ul>
		
			<li>Architecture has been a part of the teaching at the GSA from the middle of the 19th century with the first professor of architecture Eugene Bourdon.  Trained at the Ecole des Beaux-Arts in Paris. Bourdons impact on Glasgow can be seen in the work of his pupils, the best of whom were sent to work in New York architectural offices.</li>
		
			<li>The School of Architecture takes its name from Scotland's most famous architect and the GSA's most famous student - Charles Rennie Mackintosh.</li>
		
			<li>Alumni of the Mac include Jack Coia, Andy MacMillan and Isi Metzstein, of the post-war architectural practice Gillespie Kidd and Coia, Charles Rennie Mackintosh, Alan Dunlop of Murray Dunlop Architects, Gareth Hoskins, Andrew Whalley of Nicholas Grimshaw and Partners and Thomas Tait.
</li>
		
			<li>The School provides the teaching required for registration as an architect in the United Kingdom, and is recognised by the Architects Registration Board (ARB) and the Royal Institute of British Architects (RIBA). 
</li>
		
			<li>The School has its own dedicated science-led green research unit - the Mackintosh Environmental Architecture Research Unit (MEARU). 
</li>
		
			<li>The School attracts the foremost international architects, designers and critics to contribute including David Page of Page and Park Glasgow, Tom Verebes of o.c.e.a.n.uk; Sunand Prasad, Penoyre Prasad Architects London, Kisa Kawakami, sculptor and architect Tokyo, David Chipperfield, Murray Griggor, film maker, Louisa Hutton, Sauerbruch Hutton Architects in Berlin, Rein Korteknie, Parasite Foundation in Rotterdam, Martha Lagess, LaMa Arlington, Texas and Graeme Moreland, architect from Los Angeles.
</li>
		
			<li>Students become involved in live projects, field and study visits, research and competitions. Recent study visits include: Amsterdam, Barcelona, Paris, Copenhagen, Graz, Chicago, and New York and are complimented by a programme of exchanges with leading international schools in Amsterdam, Barcelona, Berlin, Copenhagen, Lausanne, Madrid, Mendrisio, Paris, Urbana-Champaign, and Vienna.
</li>
		
			<li>Honorary professors of the Mac include John Gibbons, Chief Architect with the Scottish Executive, C J Lim, Director of the Bartlett Architecture Lab at UCL, Dickon Robinson, Peabody Trust, and Wim Van Den Bergh practicing architect in the Netherlands and Professor of Architecture at the University of Aachen in Germany.</li>
		
			<li>Graduates of the Mac can be found in RMJM, Foster and Partners, David Chipperfield Architects, Michael Wildford & Partners, Terry Farrell and Partners, CZWG, Graven Images, Richard Rogers Partners, Nicholas Grimshaw and Partners, Page and Park, BDP, Michael Hopkins and Partners and professional practice across the world</li>
		
			<li>In 2005 the Architects Journal ranked the Mac as the best architecture school in Scotland and third in the UK.  It was the only Scottish architecture school in the top ten</li>
