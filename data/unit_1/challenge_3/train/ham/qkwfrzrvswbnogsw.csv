      <h1 align="center">The M.Litt.</h1>
      <p>The M.Litt. is a research degree, examined, usually after two or more 
        years of research, by a dissertation of up to 60,000 words. The criteria 
        for obtaining the degree are that the dissertation represent a 'substantial 
        contribution to knowledge', but the criteria are adapted to take account 
        of the fact that the course lasts only two years.</p>
      <p><b>It should be noted that there is no formal taught element in this 
        course of study. It does not provide a suitable foundation course from 
        which to proceed to a higher research degree, for which the most appropriate 
        course is an M.Phil. If you are looking for a course of this type you 
        should </b><a href="index.htm"><b>return to the graduate admissions front 
        page</b></a><b> and find out about the Faculty's M.Phil. courses</b>.</p>
      <p>Candidates work closely with their supervisors, who will usually be assigned 
        to them at the start of the course. It is possible to change supervisors 
        with minimal formality, and it is often desirable to do so as the research 
        project develops.</p>
      <p>Although research students spend long hours working independently, they 
        are also able to attend regular (usually fortnightly) seminars in their 
        subject area. All graduate students are required to be members of a College, 
        which offers a centre of social activity, as well as providing an opportunity 
        to meet graduates who work in other fields.</p>
      <p>All members of the University, including graduate students, are entitled 
        to attend lectures in any Faculty.</p>
      <p>In recent years the Faculty has admitted very few students for this degree. 
        It is generally felt that many candidates would benefit more from a one-year, 
        taught course such as an M.Phil., or from a full three year period of 
        research for the <a href="PhD.htm">Ph.D</a>. In reaching decisions about 
        applications the Degree Committee takes particular account of: </p>
      <ul>
        <li>The applicant's academic record and references </li>
        <li>Their suitability for the proposed course (including knowledge of 
          foreign languages) </li>
        <li>The applicant's research proposal - in particular whether it represents 
          a realistic area of study for completion within two years. </li>
        <li>Whether a suitable supervisor can be found for the proposed research 
        </li>
        <li>The written work which a candidate submits in support of their application 
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>Applications must be accompanied by a writing sample of 5,000 - 7,000 
        words. Applicants can submit any work they like, but it is worth choosing 
        work which is recent, and which relates to the proposed subject of research, 
        if material of this kind is available. It is probably more important, 
        however, to submit what you consider to be your best work than something 
        which is not your best, but is close to your field of research. Many applicants 
        submit their undergraduate dissertation or similar extended piece of work.</p>
      <p>If you have a particular subject of research in mind, you might wish 
        to visit the list of <a href="../faculty/index.htm">Members of the Faculty</a> 
        to see who might be an appropriate supervisor for you. Members of the 
        Faculty may be able to help with enquiries from potential graduate students 
        in their own field.</p>
      <p>There isn't a deadline for applications, however, it is recommended that 
        applications are sent in before 15th January if you are intending to 
        commence study on 1 October.</p>
      <p>All potential applicants should be aware that in order to be finally 
        accepted for the course it is necessary to be accepted <b>both </b>by 
        the Faculty <b>and </b>by a College. This can favour those who make early 
        applications. </p>
