<hr>

<p>This page offers a minimal modernised text of the <em>Triumph</em>.
All previous editions preserve the original spelling and
punctuation of the unique manuscript copy of this work: London,
Inner Temple, Petyt MS 538.43.14, fols 286<font size="2"><sup>r</sup></font>-289<font
size="2"><sup>r</sup></font>. Whilst the Countess of Pembroke's
Psalm metaphrases exist in manuscript copies close to her
authority, the text of the <em>Triumph</em> is at several
removes: it is a copy of the copy sent by Sir John Harington to
his cousin Lucy, Countess of Bedford in 1600, which was itself
presumably a copy of Harington's copy of Pembroke's text. The
text of this manuscript is fairly corrupt as a consequence. (For
the Petyt manuscript and Harington's textual habits see further
Jason Scott-Warren, 'Sir John Harington as a Giver of Books'
(unpublished doctoral dissertation, University of Cambridge,
1997), esp. pp. 139-45 and xliii-iv.) Previous editions have
introduced a number of emendations, totalling 12 in the recent
Clarendon Press edition of Pembroke's works. I have argued
elsewhere for another 8 emendations which are introduced here
('Mary Sidney Herbert: the Psalmes, the Triumph, and the
Scribes', <em>Sidney Journal</em>, 16ii (1998), 16-30). A further
emendation is made at I.95. All emendations are given in the
right hand column, with new emendations <strong>in bold</strong>.</p>

<p>The orthography of the manuscript text is also far from
Pembroke's spelling, and further from her punctuation, or indeed
from any system of punctuation related to the meaning of the
words. Whilst the punctuation is sometimes helpful (and might be
thought to bear traces of Pembroke's punctuation), at other times
it cuts against the run of sense quite disruptively. The scribe
is most consistent in punctuating with the metrical form, so
nearly all stanzas end with a period or colon regardless of
whether sense and syntax run on (as they tend to do in <em>terza
rima</em>). It is also the case that quotation marks can help
clarify the distribution of speeches in what is a dense and
elliptical translation. In order to make Pembroke's fine poem
more accessible I have therefore attempted a modernised text
based on the Petyt manuscript. In punctuating the text I have
made decisions about indicating what I take to be Pembroke's
primary meaning by comparing the manuscript reading, and what
traces of Pembroke's original its spelling and punctuation might
bear, with the Italian. I have tried not to overcomplicate
matters where Pembroke's intended meaning may be a mistranslation
(e.g. I.37-8, II.15). Emendations have only been made where
justified by defects both of translation and of rhyme or metre.
In using this text please remember that editions make choices
between possible meanings.</p>

<p>I have not offered any further commentary. One of the most
remarkable features of the Countess's translation is that it
matches Petrarch's <em>terza rima</em> line-for-line. Comparison
with the Italian text is a perhaps intended interpretive activity
in this case.</p>
