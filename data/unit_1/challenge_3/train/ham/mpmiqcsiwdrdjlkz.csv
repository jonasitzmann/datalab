<p>
Atmospheric waves (sometimes called buoyancy waves) have many effects upon the atmosphere, some of which can also potentially impede certain needs to topically penetrate the atmosphere at various wavelengths. Three such effects will be described and analyzed in this talk. The first will involve upper-stratospheric observations from the MSX satellite which will be shown to have been caused by waves generated by isolated thunderstorms. The second will involve ground based imager observations of a horizon to horizon front in the mesospheric airglow, followed by a number of undulations growing in time which, it will be argued, is due to an internal mesospheric bore (mathematically similar to a river bore0. This topic has received much attention in recent years. The third effect is the generation of optical turbulence in the free atmosphere by these waves when they break. Our optical turbulence model for this effect has lead to a method to forecast astronomical "seeing" conditions that is currently used at the Mauna Kea Observatory in Hawaii. The talk will conclude with some yet to be answered questions.
