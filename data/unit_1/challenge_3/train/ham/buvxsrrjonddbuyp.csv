		<h2>1/5/2007: LIVING CANVAS - AHRC GRANT AWARDED</h2><p>The DDS has been awarded an AHRC Practice-led and Applied Route award for the first stage of the Living Canvas initiative, a technical feasibility study worth &pound;12k. </p><p>The Living Canvas initiative aims to explore the novel artistic possibilities of using the performer's body and clothes as a projection surface in the context of a stage performance. A new projection system will enable a dynamic or even improvised performance by detecting the posture and silhouette of the performer and projecting imagery precisely to the selected parts of body. This will enable the performer to "wear virtual costumes" that adapt to the body, or even receive a different face. The dynamic nature of the system will give full control to the performer who can freely move around on the stage, with the projection always "following" the performer. </p><p>The Living Canvas is a collaborative initiative between The Glasgow School of Art and Theatre Cryptic led by Dr Martin Naef at the Digital Design Studio.</p><h2>1/5/2007: 1ST MEDICAL VISUALISATION WORKSHOP AT THE DIGITAL DESIGN STUDIO</h2><p>The DDS will host the first Workshop of the Scottish Medical Visualisation Network at House for an Art Lover on the 29th of May. The network is funded by the Scottish Funding Council.</p><p>The aim is to bring together a network of academics, medical practitioners, medical educators and visualisation experts. Such a network with an interest in interactive real-time imaging, simulation and reusable learning objects will provide Scotland with a profile in medical visualisation that will complement its existing international standing in medicine.</p><p>This workshop will spark debate and reflection on the needs and issues stemming from medical education and surgical rehearsal and explore how visualisation technology can be used to support present and future medical staff.</p><p>Members already include:</p><ul><li>President of the Royal College of Surgeons </li><li>Regius Professor of Clinical Surgery, Royal Infirmary, Edinburgh</li><li>Chair of Applied Clinical Anatomy, University of Dundee</li><li>Dean of Medicine, University of Glasgow </li><li>Consultant ENT Surgeon, Raigmore Hospital, Inverness</li><li>Commercial companies - Vascutech and MidTech Ltd</li></ul><p>The Network's web site will be launched around the end of May. One research project has already been secured under the umbrella of the Network:</p><p>Called Designing Out Infection and worth &pound;100K over two phases, it will explore how products, environments or working practices can be designed to reduce infections in hospitals where it is estimated that 10% of patients get a Hospital Acquired Infection during their stay in a ward. Other proposals are at the planning stage. </p><h2>15/4/2007: 1928 BRITISH EMPIRE EXHIBITION </h2><p>The DDS has just completed a prestigious research project worth &pound;146,963 from the Arts and Humanities Research Council (AHRC) to bring to life an historic event held in Glasgow in 1938.</p><p>The British Empire Exhibition was staged in Bellahouston Park the year before the start of the Second World War. It was the last publicly showcased event in which the British Empire was represented through architecture and design. The choice of Glasgow as the venue for the exhibition reflected the city's status at that time as the largest British city outside of London and its prodigious manufacturing capacity earned it the title of "Workshop of the British Empire".</p><p>The main output of the project is an interactive multimedia presentation that includes historical footage, live footage, photographs and music as well as an interactive 3D model of the actual site and its buildings as it was laid out at that time in Bellahouston Park. The model will allow fly-through visualisations of the 3D virtual site. </p><p>Each building within the site will be digitally modelled and fully detailed in its structural and external form. Clicking on a building will immediately bring it to full screen size to allow viewing from any angle. Information, both technical and descriptive, will be presented in text and by voice-over. This recreation will be accessible to the public as a permanent exhibition in the House for an Art Lover, itself fittingly located in Bellahouston Park and home to the DDS.</p><h2>15/1/2007 RCUK ACADEMIC FELLOW APPOINTED</h2><p>The Digital Design Studio are pleased to appoint Dr Martyn Horner to the GSA's first RCUK Research Fellowship post. UK Research Council Academic Fellowships provide a total funding of &pound;125,000 over a five year period. They aim to assist universities to provide contract research staff with more attractive and stable career paths into academia and ensure the guarantee of a permanent academic position at the end of the award.</p><p>Dr Horner comes directly from many years in commercial software - image processing, solid modelling and CAD - though he started in the academic research world at the Cavendish Laboratories in Cambridge. Before joining DDS as a research programmer, he was working with a company in the south of France, developing web search engines and serving on web standard committees.</p><p>His proposed research theme mixes all these aspects, combining the 3d modelling and visualization work at the DDS with the cultural, social and technical issues of 'Web 3.0'. Having moved to Glasgow nearly three years ago he concedes that the weather is not as good but the culture and the warmth of Glaswegians more than makes up.</p><h2>21/9/2006 - DDS JOINS EUROPEAN RESEARCH PROJECT</h2><p>The GSA has recently been invited to join a European research project called NETConnect investigating the cultural, economic and artistic links between three archaeological sites in Italy, Germany and Poland. </p><p>Starting in September 2006, this three year project will provide content such as images, text, videos, maps, physical models and 3D site reconstructions to be made available through the internet, mobile phones and GIS technology. </p><p>The Digital Design Studio will provide modelling services for the project with Douglas Pritchard as the technical lead, following up on successful projects such as the British Empire Exhibition or the virtual model of the City of Glasgow. The GSA efforts will be coordinated by Professor Tom Maver from the Mackintosh School of Architecture.</p>
