Itis the strongest indication that they are by a woman poet:<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2"><p><BLOCKQUOTE> To the Reader<br><cite>I thought it not amisse (courteous Reader) to adioyne unto this smalllabour of mine, these two following Epistles, of which one is translatedout of </cite>Ouid<cite>, the other is an answeare thereunto. Which chiefly I did,least the sweete exercises of that honorable and thrise renowned </cite>Sapho<cite> ofour times, should euen the least of them, be lost in the obscure night ofsad silence, and Obliuion: and then, especially the subiect, and the matterso fitly agreeing and participating with the former, I could not but couplethem together in all points else, a most unequall match. Wherein I hope thegreatest fault that I have committed is, but that it hath not the firstplace. Yet take this old Prouerbe with a right application for my iustexcuse.</cite><br><center>All is well that endeth well. <em>And so end I</em>. <br>Reader farewell.<a name="back1">[<a href="#note1">1</a>]</a></BLOCKQUOTE></center><p>Parts of this preface are a little ambiguous, but it is clear that at leastone of the two poems which follow is by someone else. The person creditedwith the poems is called the 'Sapho of our times', which strongly suggeststhat the author is a woman, and a famous woman (so probably not one unknownto us). The looseness as to what exactly is 'the former', and what 'unequallmatch' results, allows for either the 'Aeneas to Dido' reply alone, or bothepistles, to be by the new author. The 'Aeneas to Dido' poem, since it isthe last, and 'all is well that endeth well', must surely be by the otherauthor. Furthermore, for F.L. to continue after saying 'And so end I' seemsawkward. Also, the material in the epistles which fits with the <em>Remedia</em>(fulfilling his claim that the 'matter' agrees with the former) comes inAeneas's reply (lines 215-50). The balance of probability seems to betowards both poems being by this 'Sapho' figure, and it seems more plausiblefor F.L. to join the two poems to his translation and then justify it. Ifthe 'Dido to Aeneas' is by F.L. then one would expect to hear either aboutthe remarkable coincidence or the decision to write the epistle whichanticipates the reply.<p>	This preface narrows the search for an author very considerably. Thelist of candidates for the title 'Sapho of our times', as long as it isaccepted that this must be a woman, is very short. It is hard to see morethan one plausible candidate, and that is Isabella Whitney. Betty Travitskycalls her 'apparently the first declared professional woman poet inEngland'. <a name="back2"></a>[<a href="#note2">2</a>] Her two published works appeared in 1567 and 1573, ageneration before the publication of F.L.'s translation. <a name="back3"></a>[<a href="#note3">3</a>] This fits wellwith the 'obscure night of sad silence' into which the work of the 'Sapho'is said to be disappearing. The metres also fit with the date: sesta rimaand poulter's measure are both metres used by Whitney in poems known to beby her, and the latter in particular is very characteristic of the 1560s and1570s, and a less so of 1600. <a name="back4"></a>[<a href="#note4">4</a>] Whitney's poetry also reveals a somewhatturbulent life, with copious complaint about abandonment and a feeling ofhelplessness. This perhaps explains the connection with 'Sapho' a littlefurther, in that Whitney's perspective on sexual politics can beanti-patriarchal. <a name="back5"></a>[<a href="#note5">5</a>] Being a woman poet at all was possibly enough toexplain the name, but the name would have been difficult to apply to othertenuous candidates: it is unlikely to have been used of the Countess ofPembroke, for example, or of Queen Elizabeth herself. Neither of these womenis known to have produced poetry anything like these epistles (nor is suchpoetry plausibly conjectured) and the prospect of imminent 'Oblivion' doesnot seem appropriate in either case. <a name="back6"></a>[<a href="#note6">6</a>]<p>	The real strength of the attribution to Whitney is the remarkable waythat the Dido-Aeneas epistles fit into her career. Her work returns onnumerous occasions to an interest in Ovid and many of her poems owesomething to the tradition of the <em>Heroides</em>. In her first collection, <em>TheCopy of a letter</em> (1567), both the central poems are deeply immersed in it.'The Copy of a letter' itself cites the story of Jason, to whom <em>Heroides</em> 6and 12 are addressed. Two stanzas earlier it takes on the story of Aeneasand Dido:<p><BLOCKQUOTE>	As by ENEAS first of all,<br>who dyd poore DIDO leave,<br>Causing the Quene by his untrueth<br>with Sword her hart to cleave. (33-6) <a name="back7"></a>[<a href="#note7">7</a>]</BLOCKQUOTE><p>'The Copy of a letter' is explicitly sent from a woman to her 'unconstantlover', with the gender of its author adding a certain sharpness to theOvidian model. This sharpness is there in Whitney's version of the Aeneasand Dido story, which she slants against the hero, registering his'untrueth' to 'poore DIDO'. The second poem in the collection, 'Theadmonition by the Auctor, to all yong Gentilwomen', makes reference to theOvidian stories of Phyllis and Demophoon, Hero and Leander, and Paris andOenone (65-88), all of which feature in the <em>Heroides</em> (2, 18-19, and 5respectively). This poem actually adopts an antagonistic attitude towardsOvid and other male poets: <a name="back8"></a>[<a href="#note8">8</a>]<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2"><p><BLOCKQUOTE>	Some use the teares of Crocodiles,<br>contrary to their hart:<br>And yf they cannot alwayes weepe,<br>	they wet their Cheekes by Art.</BLOCKQUOTE><p><BLOCKQUOTE>	Ovid, within his Arte of love,<br>doth teach them this same knacke<br>To wet their hand and touch their eies:<br>so oft as teares they lacke. (17-24) <a name="back9"></a>[<a href="#note9">9</a>]</BLOCKQUOTE><p>In the <em>Heroides</em> Ovid's female narrators voice their unhappiness at theirtreatment by men. In his other poems, however, there is less sympathytowards women. The <em>Ars Amatoria</em> (the 'Arte of love') provides tricks anddeceits for the potential seducer and thus incurs Whitney's wrath. <a name="back10"></a>[<a href="#note10">10</a>] Shewrites in an Ovidian tradition as far as it allows a female poetic voice toemerge, but allows that voice to criticise Ovid when he writes againstwomen. <a name="back11"></a>[<a href="#note11">11</a>] The adoption of a male voice in order to reply to Ovid (as in theepistle from Aeneas) might be seen as characteristically interested in thegendered voices of poetry. <a name="back12"></a>[<a href="#note12">12</a>]<p>	When Whitney does ventriloquise the voice of Aeneas her poetry showssome signs of attempting to assume a male persona. Aeneas's reply does notdefuse the heartfelt anger of the abandoned Dido, or indeed answer herspecific charges with anything unexpected, and it ends with a hollowadvocation of some <em>Remedia Amoris</em> techniques for forgetting a lost love(215-50). One possible male touch comes when Aeneas describes the way helearned of his destiny:<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2"><p><BLOCKQUOTE>	And now of Gods the fatal messenger <br>From Jove himself (they both my witness be) <br>Hath message brought, I saw the God most clear.<br>I plainly heard what words he spake to me. <br>Leave then with plaints to set us both on fire, <br>Constrain'd I go, not with mine owne desire. (A-D, 71-6) <a name="back13"></a>[<a href="#note13">13</a>]</BLOCKQUOTE><p>There may be a stereotypical maleness in his emphasis on the simplicity andclarity of the message, counterpointing the emotional depth of Dido's poem.By recalling the plain style of the message Aeneas seems to want to shrugoff the power of her 'plaints'. On its own this is not exactly asystematic attempt to ventriloquise a specifically male rhetoric. However,that this may be part of the point is suggested by Aeneas's attack onwomen:<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2"><p><BLOCKQUOTE>	You thoughtless sit within your princely bower, <br>Or minding only love or life's delight.<br>Your fame meantime, like tender springtide flower <br>The busy blasts of bitter tongues do bite. <br>Each deed, each word, yea countenance and thought <br>Of simplest sort, are under censure brought. (A-D, 125-30)</BLOCKQUOTE><p>Whitney, if it is her, portrays a man seeing women living lives of leisure.That Whitney's domestic bower was far from serene provides a poignantsubtext to what is at best a clumsy attack from Aeneas. He comes across asselfish and insensitive, but his words capture a credible (and unappealing)male perspective. On another occasion he attacks the irrationality of hiscorrespondent:<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2"><p><BLOCKQUOTE>	But thou mad dog, whose reason lies in rage,<br>Who no rule else, but recklessness doth know,<br>Nor reverence bearest to thy father's age, <br>Nor from thy brother canst abstain thy blow. <br>And lest for that fault might with thee be found <br>By only us, thou did'st thy mother wound. (A-D, 173-8)</BLOCKQUOTE><p>The author finds good verse to express these stereotyping and (again)misogynistic words. This is one of several moments in the Dido-Aeneas pairwith far more vitality than F.L.'s translation of Ovid (which it follows inthe book). The male voice here looks to the passion of women and finds ituncomfortably reckless, and again it seems possible that the author isexploring the plight of women from another angle, creating a provocativepersona. This is something which fits well with Whitney's other poems.<p>	Whitney's second collection, <em>A sweet Nosgay, Or pleasant Posye:contayning a hundred and ten Phylosophicall Flowers</em> (1573), which is basedaround a versification of Hugh Plat's <em>Flowers of Philosophy</em> (1572), startswith another anti-Ovidian gesture in its preface 'The Auctor to the Reader':<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2"><p><BLOCKQUOTE>	I straight waxt wery of those Bookes,<br>and many other more<br>As VIRGILL, OVID, MANTUAN,<br>which many wonders bore. (21-4)</BLOCKQUOTE><p>Despite her professed weariness with such secular poetry, the poems whichfollow (and which do not derive from Plat's worthy work) do not show arejection of Ovidian topoi. At the end of the volume are 'Certain familierEpistles and friendly Letters'. These come, notably, with replies,suggesting that Whitney had an interest in letters as parts of dialogues,or that establishing these dialogues was important to her. Dido's letter isrendered both less and more forlorn by the reply. Whitney's poem 'To herBrother. G.W.' emulates some of Ovid's heroines in its wish for contact(17-24), further allying them with the troubled life of the author (andperhaps further sketching in a psychological background to the need to replyto the <em>Heroides</em>). 'To her Brother. B.W.' has a beginning which is pure<em>Heroides</em>:<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2"><p><BLOCKQUOTE>	Good Brother Brooke, I often looke,<br>to heare of your returne:<br>But none can tell, if you be well,<br>nor where you doo sojurne:<br>Which makes me feare, that I shall heare<br>your health appaired is:<br>And oft I dread, that you are dead,<br>or somethyng goes amys. (1-8)</BLOCKQUOTE><p>This is not the best verse Whitney wrote. However, this is a significantpoem in that it shows her so candidly casting herself in the <em>Heroides</em> role.This work of Ovid's seems to have provided a model for her to imitate andan articulation of some very real anxieties, while also providing a versionof a female poetic voice, even if it is one which provides painful roles forwomen.<p>	It is for this reason that the Dido-Aeneas epistles, if they areattributable to Whitney, will not fit in on the edge of her oeuvre. Perhapsprompted by George Turbervile's translation of the <em>Heroides</em> which appearedin 1567, these poems encapsulate so many of their author's interests that,if they are hers, they must be among her most important poems. <a name="back14"></a>[<a href="#note14">14</a>] The mostcompelling reason for this is that by writing Aeneas's reply to Ovid's Dido,she overturns the gender dynamics of the genre and offers herself the chanceto adopt a challenging new voice. Critics of renaissance women's writinghave often noted points where authors use genres which are more readilyidentified with male voices. Ann Rosalind Jones describes the Ovidianqualities of the 'Copy of a Letter' in these terms:<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2"><p><BLOCKQUOTE>	Whitney shifts the voices of Ovid's solitary heroines into thespeaking position of a marriage counselor whose opinions arelegitimated by decades of advice books. As a result, she writesto her 'unconstant lover' not as his victim but as his superior.She then turns to an audience of women as a social and literarycritic, to expose men's deceptions of women. <a name="back15"></a>[<a href="#note15">15</a>]</BLOCKQUOTE><p>This casts Whitney's work as a kind of corrective to the maleness of Ovidianpoetry, providing a counterbalancing earnestness. Elaine Berlin gives thisa specifically learned, godly, protestant aspect, with Whitney seeking tohelp others with teaching about the role of women. <a name="back16"></a>[<a href="#note16">16</a>] In other poems sheemulates different aspects of Ovid's poetry, with the 'Wyll and Testament'(in the Nosgay collection) in particular showing some of the Latin writer'surbanity, irony, and enthusiasm for what the city has to offer. <a name="back17"></a>[<a href="#note17">17</a>]Generally it is fair to say that Whitney's second collection does focus onmore moral advice for women. 'An order... to two of her yonger Sisters'counsels them to 'exile' all 'wanton toyes' from their minds (21-4).However, her interest in the Dido story persists in this volume most visiblyin 'A carefull complaynt by the unfortunate Auctor', which is worth quotingin full:<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2"><p><BLOCKQUOTE>	Good DIDO stint thy teares,<br>and sorrowes all resigne<br>To mee: that borne was to augment,<br>misfortunes lucklesse line.<br>Or using styll the same,<br>good DIDO doo thy best:<br>In helpyng to bewayle the hap,<br>that furthereth mine unrest.<br>For though thy Troyan mate,<table border = 0 cellpadding = 0 align = right width = "25%"><tr><td>10</td></tr></table><br>that Lorde AENEAS hight:<br>Requityng yll thy stedfast love,<br>from Carthage tooke his slight.<br>And fowly brake his oth,<br>and promise made before:<br>Whose falshode finisht thy delight,<br>before thy haires were hore.<br>Yet greater cause of griefe<br>compells mee to complayne:<br>For Fortune fell converted hath,<table border = 0 cellpadding = 0 align = right width = "25%"><tr><td>20</td></tr></table><br>My health to heapes of payne.<br>And that she sweares my death,<br>to playne it is (alas)<br>Whose end let malyce styll attempt,<br>to bring the same to passe.<br>O DIDO thou hadst liv'de,<br>A happye Woman styll,<br>If fickle fancy had not thrald<br>thy wits: to retchlesse wyll.<br>For as the man by whom,<table border = 0 cellpadding = 0 align = right width = "25%"><tr><td>30</td></tr></table><br>thy deadly dolors bred:<br>Without regard of plighted troth,<br>from CARTHAGE CITIE fled.<br>So might thy cares in tyme,<br>be banisht out of thought:<br>His absence might well salve the sore,<br>that earst his presence wrought.<br>For fyre no lenger burnes,<br>then Faggots feede the flame:<br>Thy want of things that breede annoy,<table border = 0 cellpadding = 0 align = right width = "25%"><tr><td>40</td></tr></table><br>may soone redresse the same.<br>But I unhappy moste,<br>and gript with endles griefes:<br>Dispayre (alas) amid my hope,<br>and hope without reliefe.<br>And as the sweltyng heate,<br>consumes the Wax away:<br>So doo the heapes of deadly harmes,<br>styll threaten my decay.<br>O Death delay not long,<table border = 0 cellpadding = 0 align = right width = "25%"><tr><td>50</td></tr></table><br>thy dewtye to declare:<br>Ye Sisters three dispatch my dayes<br>and finysh all my care.</BLOCKQUOTE><p>The poem ends like several <em>Heroides</em>, with a wish for death, and it is basedon that of Dido, and her description of her woes. Whitney casts herself asDido's successor and indeed as someone whose pains are worse. She also showsa certain lack of sympathy for her predecessor, and uses the same word ofDido, 'retchlesse' (i.e. reckless), that Aeneas does in his reply whichseems also to be by Whitney (line 174). This itself is useful evidence infavour of the attribution. Most of all this poem establishes how importantthe Dido-Aeneas story, and Ovid's version of it, were to Whitney, making animitation by her an unsurprising thing to find. In the <em>Nosgay</em> volume thereis a reply to the 'carefull complaynt' from one T.B., entitled(unpromisingly) 'An answer to comfort her, by shewing his haps to beharder'. It urges a sense of proportion and mentions Dido twice in its 28lines:<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2"><p><BLOCKQUOTE>	For DIDO, thou, and many thousands more,<br>which living feele the panges of extreme care,<br>Though tottered much; and torne in peeces smal:<br>whom ever griping death doth never spare.<br>Nor he, that falsey, Carthage Citie fled,<br>so fraught with wiles, nor ye such sorrowes tast,<br>By thousand partes, as I who rightly sed:<br>do pine as WAX, before the fire wastes (9-16)<br>	...<br>Till then, with silly DIDO be content,<br>and rip no more, thy wronges in such excesse:<br>Thy FORTUNE rather, wills thee to lament,<br>with speedy wit, til hope may have redresse. (25-8) </BLOCKQUOTE><p>Whitney replies to this and does not stop bewailing her lot. If a place forthe Dido-Aeneas poems needs to be found in her career, the lack of depth inT.B.'s depiction of 'silly DIDO' may have been just the thing to spurWhitney to translate <em>Heroides</em> 7 and to compose a reply from Aeneas. This,though, is not the point, which is rather that it is hard to imagine twopoems which would fit better in Whitney's career than the Dido-Aeneas pair.<p>	There remain some problems with the attribution. It is of coursepossible that F.L. (and/or his printer) may be lying or wrong when he saysthat the poems are by someone else. The way these poems fit so well inWhitney's oeuvre seems almost too good to be true. However, if the presenceof spurious Whitney works were worth lying about then her name might beexpected to appear. Also, if this is a lie then it seems a wasted one giventhat the second author is not made a selling point of the book on itstitle-page. If the second preface's claim is simply a mistake then it is anunderstandable one given the literary evidence connecting author and poem.An error could explain things if the weight of other evidence forattribution seems too little. However, like the notion of deception, thatof simple error on its own does not have the substance of the positivereasons for attribution.<p>Raphael Lyne<br>New Hall, Cambridge<br><a href=mailto:rtrl100@cam.ac.uk>rtrl100@cam.ac.uk</a><br><p><a href="index.htm">Aeneas and Isabella Homepage</a><p><h2>Notes</h2><p><a name="note1">1</a>.

Other candidates include: Anne Dowriche, author of<em> The FrenchHistorie</em> (1589), whose very protestant version of French chronicle makes astrange companion for the Dido-Aeneas poems, and Rachel Speght, who althougha vigorous defender of women who uses classical imagery, writes almostcertainly too late (works published 1617-1621, probably only born 1597). SeeElaine V. Beilin, 'Writing Public Poetry: Humanism and the Woman Writer',<em>Modern Language Quarterly</em>, 51 (1990), 249-71, pp. 269-71 (on Speght), 258-67(on Dowriche). Lucy Harington was born in 1581 and received her first majordedication in 1597, but her own poetry (none of which resembles theepistles) comes later, if her only extant poem, part of the 1609 'Death benot proud' exchange with Donne, is representative. Aemilia Lanier was bornin 1569 and had an eventful life, but her works were published in 1611, andher country-house poem 'To Cooke-ham' suggests her poetic awakening happenedduring her stay at the house between 1601 and 1609. Elizabeth Cary was bornin 1585 and had no works published until Mariam in 1613. [<a href="#back6">back</a>]<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2"><p><a name="note7">7</a>.
