Abstract:
</H4>

<p>
After a brief introduction to some practical inverse problems, an outline of Bayesian statistics will be given. The task of validation will be discussed. The connection between conventional inverse problems methods and the Bayesian approach will be indicated. Then a detailed study of the inverse problem on the logistic map will be made. (The logistic map is a simple example of a chaotic system that also finds application as the basis of some random number generators.)
