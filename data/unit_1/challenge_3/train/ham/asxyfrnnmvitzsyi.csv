One of the four extant scenes of the Life of the Virgin, from an East Anglian altar frontal of c.1330-50 (see Image 136). The depiction of St Anne teaching her daughter Mary how to read appears to have been invented as an artistic subject in England in the early years of the 14th century and was exceptionally popular in English art until the last quarter of the century.  After that it becomes less popular and was always much less common on the continent. The scene has no source in the apocryphal gospels, and conflicts with their accounts of the Virgin being educated in the Temple. 

In the composition of the frontal's scene St Anne holds her daughter, while vigorously pointing over her shoulder at the text with her other hand.  The composition which shows Mary with her back to St Anne is less common than depictions in which mother and child face each other. The text is a variant on the Vulgate text of Psalm 44: 11-12 (AV 45):10-11: 'Hearken, O daughter, and consider, and incline thine ear; forget also thine own people and thy father's house, so shall the king greatly desire thy beauty: for he is thy Lord; and worship thou him'. Traditional Christian exegesis interpreted these verses in terms of the relationship between Christ as bridegroom and the church as the individual soul, especially virgins betrothed to Christ, as here they anticipate the Annunication to Mary. In view of the Dominicans' commitment to teaching, there was no more fitting subject for the altarpiece of a Dominican priory.
