</TD></TR></TABLE><BR><B>dinburgh,</B> the metropolis of Scotland and county town of Midlothian, is situated 2 miles S of the Firth of Forth. Its Observatory on the Calton Hill stands in lat. 55&deg; 57' 23" N, and long. 3o 10' 30&pound; W. It is SSW of Aberdeen, S by W of Dundee, S by E of Perth, E by N of Glasgow, NE of Ayr, and N by E of Dumfries. Its distance in straight line, as the crow flies, is 186 miles from John o' Groat's House, and 337 from London. Its distance, by road, is 35&frac12; miles from Stirling, 42 from Dundee, 42&frac34; from Glasgow, 44 from Perth, 49 from Hawick, 57 from Berwick-upon-Tweed, 71 from Dumfries, 92&frac12; from Carlisle, 108 from Aberdeen, 156&frac12; from Inverness, and 392 from London; while, by railway, the distance is 36 miles from Stirling, 45 from Perth, 47&frac12; from Glasgow, 49&frac12; from Dundee, 53 from Hawick, 57&frac34; from Berwick-upon-Tweed, 88 from Ayr, 90 from Dumfries, 98 &frac14; from Carlisle, 112&frac34; from Aberdeen, 163 from Stranraer, 189 from Inverness, and 398&frac12; from London by way of the Trent Valley or Midland Railway, 402 by way of Carlisle and Birmingham or London and North-Western, 407&frac12; of Berwick and York, Great Northern and East Coast. <P><I>Site.</I>&#151;The city is built on ridges of east-and-westward extension of varying height, and on the valleys between or the slopes beyond. The hills are partly overlapped by, and partly extend beyond, the city; they occupy an area within a circuit of about 6 miles; and, at their northern margin, about 2 miles from the Firth, are bounded by a slightly inclined plain, which extends from them to the shore. These hills consist mainly of erupted rocks, thrown up from what was once a flat surface by a series of upheavals, and afterwards much modified by denudation and other causes; and, in their natural state, before they were taken possession of by man, must have formed a singularly striking and imposing group. Arthur's Seat, to the SE of these, rises 822 feet above sea-level, sloping or rolling to the E over a base of nearly a mile, and presenting to the W a bold, precipitous, diversified-face of rugged rock, with an outline, as seen at short distances a little to the S of W, resembling that of a lion couchant. A sloping valley lies along the W base of this hill, known as the Hunter's Bog, which, though not long ago as solitary as any remote Highland glen, is now used almost daily by the Edinburgh garrison and local volunteers as a range for rifle practice. Westward of this valley the ground rises regularly over a base of about 700 yards, till it attains a height of 574 feet above sea-level; then in a semicircle, sweeping round convexly from the S to the N, breaks sheer down in the rugged greenstone precipices of Salisbury Crags. At the base of these crags there is a footpath several feet in width, vulgarly known as the Radical Road, from which a most commanding and beautiful prospect is obtained. A belt of low ground, variously flat, sloping, and undulating, lies round the skirts of these two hills, the whole attached to the royal grounds of Holyrood, and included in what is now called the Queen's Park. The Calton Hill, which commences about 200 yards NW of the N end of the Salisbury semicircle, rises, in somewhat rounded contour, to an altitude of 348 feet above sea-level, and represents, to the NW, an abruptly sloping face, overlooking what was an old village, called Greenside; but, in other directions, the declivities, though rapid, are by no means steep, and it has here been so terraced by art as to afford room for rows all round of elegant private houses. It bears on its shoulders and summit various public buildings and monuments; and, like the loftier hills to the SE, is distinguished for the magnificence of the views which it offers, as well as the additional feature it contributes to the general aspect of the city. <P>The ground to the W of the hollow at the base of Salisbury Crags rises in rapid gradient, till, at the distance of 500 yards, it attains an elevation in St Leonard's Hill of 248 feet; and forms thence a broadbacked ridge of about 1400 yards from E to W. This ground declines from its summit to a flanking ravine on the N, and slopes S by imperceptible gradation, till, at the distance of a mile, it merges in flat or softly undulating open country. It is covered over nearly all its area by the streets and suburbs of the more modern section of the Old Town. The ravine stretching E and W along the N base of this ridge is occupied by an ancient street known as the Cowgate, once the abode of the nobles and grandees of Scotland, but now a haunt of the poorest classes, bearing nearly the same relation to Edinburgh as the district of St Giles bears to London. A hill, which has been aptly compared to a long wedge lying flat on the ground, ascends gradually westward from the hollow between Salisbury Crags and the Calton Hill, to a distance of 1800 yards, flanking closely the N side of the Cowgate. It commences on the E at level ground in front of Holyrood Palace, and terminates on the W, at an altitude of 437 feet above sea-level, in the frowning citadel crowning the grandly massive precipice of the Castle rock. It was along the ridge of this hill that the original city was at length built, which consisted, as it still does, of one long street stretching steadily upwards from the Palace to the Castle, flanked all the way by tall tenements, and sending off no end of close lanes of similar piles in downward slope to the right and left, so that the whole has been compared to some huge reptile figure, of which the closes were the lateral members, Holyrood the tail, and the Castle the head. A vale, averaging about 200 yards wide, extends along the N base of this wedge-shaped hill, which, where it lies under the wing of the city proper, was formerly the bed of a sheet of water, called the Nor' Loch; but is now drained, being occupied partly by public gardens, partly by railway lines and a station, and crossed by a mound and bridges. An eminence, or very gentle and broad-backed ridge, with features much less salient than those of any of the other rising-grounds, ascends northward from the vale to a distance of about 250 yards, and descends thence, in the main, in a long easy slope, to the plain between the city and the Firth. It swells, near its eastern extremity, into a considerable rounded shoulder, terminating at that end in a curving gorge which separates it from the Calton Hill; declines, at its W extremity partly in almost imperceptible slope to the environing low ground, partly in considerable declivity to the banks of the Water of Leith; and bears, on its southern half, the original New Town, and on its northern half and western slopes, the second New Town. <P>Most travellers who have visited both cities have remarked a resemblance, as to site and general appearance, between Edinburgh and Athens. Stewart, the author of <I>The Antiquities of Athens,</I> was the first to remark and describe the similarity; and he has been followed by Dr Clarke, Mr H. W. Williams, and any other descriptive writers well qualified to form a correct judg ent, so that Edinburgh has, by almost general consent, been called `Modern Athens,' and the `Athens of the North.' `The distant view of Athens from the &AElig;gean Sea,' says Mr Williams, `is extremely like that of Edinburgh from the Firth of Forth, though certainly the latter is considerably superior.' `There are,' he adds, 'several points of view on the elevated grounds near Edinburgh, from which the resemblance between the two cities is complete. From Torphin in particular, one of the low heads of the Pentlands immediately above the village of Colinton, the landscape is exactly that of the vicinity of Athens as viewed from the bottom of Mount Anchesmus. Close upon the right, Brilessus is represented by the Mound of Braid; before, in the abrupt and dark mass of the Castle, rises the Acropolis; the hill Lycabettus, joined to that of the Areopagus, appears in the Calton; in the Firth of Forth we behold the &AElig;gean Sea; in Inchkeith, &AElig;gina; and the hills of Peloponnesus are precisely those of the opposite coast of Fife. Nor is the resemblance less striking in the general characteristics of the scene; for, although we cannot exclaim, "These are the groves of the Academy, and that the Sacred Way! " yet, as on the Attic shore, we certainly here behold " a country rich and gay, broke into hills with balmy odours crowned, and joyous vales, mountains and streams, and clustering towns, and monuments of fame, and scenes of glorious deeds, in little bounds." It is, indeed, most remarkable and astonishing that two cities, placed at such a distance from each other, and so different in every political and artificial circumstance, should naturally be so alike. 'When comparing the two cities as to their interior structure, however, Mr Williams sees a considerable difference between them, and pronounces Edinburgh to be the superior. He says, `The epithets Northern Athens and Modern Athens have been so frequently applied to Edinburgh that the mind unconsciously yields to the illusion awakened by these terms, and imagines that the resemblance between these cities must extend from the natural localities and the public buildings to the streets and private edifices. The very reverse of this is the case; for, setting aside her public structures, Athens, even in her best days, could not have coped with the capital of Scotland.' <P><I>Scenery.</I>&#151;Edinburgh, from whatever point the eye regards it, presents a variety of scenic groupings of such singular effect as is met with in no other city of the world. Though there is nothing gorgeous or sumptuous in any one feature, neither is there anything mean; it is, in a scenic regard, a city all over, and bespeaks a presence as of something at once grand and venerable. A stranger coming within fair view of it from any quarter sees no a&euml;rial dome towering above a sea of of humbler piles as in Rome and London, and no grove of turrets shooting up from some majestic cathedral as in Milan and York; but, wherever he turns, there is presented to him a rich and varied assemblage of substantial, often imposing, structures-now retiring into the valleys, now climbing the acclivities, now spreading over the slopes, and anon crowning the summits of its romantic hills. He observes nowhere, as in so many of the other cities of world repute, a mere dingy conglomeration of commonplace houses, clustered round some magnificent edifice, or hugging the environs of some handsome airy street, but on all hands elegance, beauty, variety, and grandeur struggling for ascendancy, and contributing by their harmony to produce the most unique and superb effects. Plainness, poverty, unsightliness, even offensive squalor, as well mal-arrangement and positive confusion, do, as in all our large towns, indeed challenge censurable regard; but these do not strike the eye with such obtrusiveness as to mar the general effect, or, if they do, it is often with some redeeming feature or association as to contribute to, rather than detract from, the impression the city as a rule imparts. Nor, as the eye surveys them, are the surroundings, far as well as n ear, of the city, the framework in which the jewel is set, less striking than the interior. These extend from the Lammermuirs on the SE to the Grampians on the NW, and from the open sea of the German Ocean to the very sources of the Forth; and, besides what may still further be regarded as back-ground, consisting of high lands and low, they embrace nearly the whole of the Firth, a great part of Fife, and a still greater part of the richly cultivated, fairly wooded, hill-and-dale expanse of the Lothians; so that, if we except the moodily desolate, the wildly grand, and the savagely terrible, there is hardly a single aspect of Nature to be met with elsewhere of which we may not trace some feature here. It is thus these scenes are described by Delta in the well-known lines- <P><BLOCKQUOTE><FONT SIZE="-1">'Traced like a map the landscape lies,<BR> In cultured beauty stretching wide;<BR> There Pentland's green acclivities,<BR> There ocean with its azure tide,<BR> There Arthur's Seat, and, gleaming through<BR> The southern wing, Dunedin blue;<BR> While in the Orient Lammer's daughters,<BR> A distant giant range, are seen,<BR> North Berwick Law, with cone of green,<BR> And Bass amid the waters.'</FONT></BLOCKQUOTE> <P>Picturesque views of the city, either by itself or in combination with strips of foreground, may be obtained from various points all round and beyond the outskirts, each one of which, as it embraces separately distinct features and groupings, will be found to be more or less substantially different from the others. One at hand on the W, especially from the lands of Coates, takes in the new princely piles in the neighbourhood, the spire of St Mary's Cathedral, the dome of St George's parish church, the campanile of Free St George's, with, farther back, the tower and pinnacles of St John's, and the massive, bastioned, mural rock of the Castle; while at a station more remote, particularly from Corstorphine Hill, a view of wider range is obtained, which, besides including the objects mentioned in diminished proportions, embraces a great part of the New Town as it slopes down to the shores of the Forth, with the heights of the Old declining away eastward, dominated by the smoke-veiled cliffs of Salisbury Crags with Arthur's Seat in their rear. A near view from the N side, especially one from Warriston Cemetery and another from the Botanic Garden, comprises all the New Town to the N as it slopes upward to the Old Town with its towers and castle-battlements invading the sky, flanked to the right by the heights above the Dean, and to the left by the Calton Hill with its monuments, and another sideward view of Arthur's Seat and the Crags. Farther N this view, though always of course on a smaller scale, becomes more and more picturesque, till, as you approach and land on the Fife shores right opposite, the whole assumes a toy-box dimension, with the ports of Leith and Granton on the foreground and the blue ridges of the Lammernirs and the Pentlands traced on the vault behind. Views of the city from the E may be obtained from the Calton Hill, Salisbury Crags, and Arthur's Seat. That from the Calton Hill, from which the view all round is of a kind to baffle description, overlooks the city along the line of Princes Street with the New Town, backed- by the western hills, on the right, as it first rises with its spires and monuments, and slopes away down to the N; and the Old Town on the left, as it slopes upwards, flanked by the Crags, from Holyrood to the Castle summit, with the hazy Pentlands looming in the background. <P>The view from the face of Salisbury Crags is thus described by Sir Walter Scott: `The prospect, in its general outline, commands a close-built, high-piled city, stretching itself out in a form which, to a romantic imagination, may be supposed to represent that of a dragon; now a noble arm of the sea, with its rocks, isles, distant shores, and boundary of mountains; and now a fair and fertile champaign country, varied with hill, dale, and rock, and skirted by the picturesque ridge of the Pentland mountains; but as the path gently circles around the base of the cliffs, the prospect, composed as it is of these enchanting and sublime objects, changes at every step, and presents them blended with, or divided from, each other in every possible variety which can gratify the eye and the imagination. 'The view from the top of Arthur's Seat is much the same as that from Salisbury Crags, except that it is more sweeping, and has the crest of the crags on the western foreground. A good view from the E of the city proper, exclusive of the environs, is obtained from St Anthony's Chapel. Here at his feet the spectator sees on the right the northern section of the Queen's Park, with Holyrood Palace and the Chapel Royal; beyond these, the terraced ascent of the Calton Hill, with its tiers in rows and separate piles of remarkable architectures and sculptures; in front the valley between the Old Town and the New, spanned by the lofty North Bridge; and toward the left, all the old city itself, towering upward from the point of the wedge, ridge above ridge, and grandly fretted and crowned with heaven-pointing spires and defiant battlements. The views from the S, both near and distant, are at once numerous and excellent, most of these affording distinct profiles of Arthur's Seat and Salisbury Crags on the right and of the Castle rock and ramparts on the left, with much of the intermediate architecture of the Old Town and the suburb of the city in the foreground, which already all but occupies the entire southern slope. One of the noblest on this side is the view from Blackford Hill, and is thus described by Sir Walter Scott as seen by Lord Marmion, `fairer scene he ne'er surveyed:' <P><BLOCKQUOTE><FONT SIZE="-1">'The wandering eye could o'er it go,<BR> And mark the distant city glow<BR> With gloomy splendour red;<BR> For on the smoke-wreaths, huge and slow,<BR> 'That round her sable turrets flow,<BR> The morning beams were shed,<BR> And tinged them with a lustre proud<BR> Like that which streaks a thundercloud.<BR> Such dusky grandeur clothed the height<BR> where the huge castle holds its state,<BR> And ail the steep slope down,<BR> Whose ridgy back heaves to the sky,<BR> Piled deep and massy, close and high,<BR> Mine own romantic town!<BR> But northward far, with purer blaze,<BR> On Ochil mountains fell the rays,<BR> And as each heathy top they kissed,<BR> It gleamed a purple amethyst.<BR> Yonder the shores of Fife you saw;<BR> Here Preston Bay and Berwick Law;<BR> and broad. between them rolled,<BR> The gallant Firth the eye might note,<BR> Whose islands on its bosom float,<BR> Like emeralds chased in gold.'</FONT></BLOCKQUOTE> <P>The views of the city from the interior are often no less striking than those from without, and the former as well as the latter often give rise to impressions that are quite unique. Not to mention the ore artificial adornments, architectural and other, with their grouping and array, there are the imposing natural features, with beetling cliffs and hollow or open dells, and rich interspaces of wooded lawn, tended by the art of the gardener, and interspersed or bordered here and there with gay parterres. The streets also, even in the central parts, afford, through abrupt openings, numerous prospects, both charming and extensive, along unobstructed vistas, or over asses of house-tops, away, by varied landscape, over firth and dale, on to the often far-off mountains, and in one direction the open sea. `The finest view from the interior,' says Alexander Smith, `is obtained from the corner of St Andrew Street, looking W. Straight before you the Mound crosses the valley, bearing the National Gallery buildings; beyond, the Castle lifts, from grassy slopes and billows of summer foliage, its weather. stained towers and fortifications, the halfmoon battery giving the folds of its standard to the wind. Living in Edinburgh there abides, above all things, a sense of its beauty. Hill, crag, castle, rock, blue stretch of sea, the picturesque ridge of the Old Town, the squares and terraces of the New-these things, seen once are not to be forgotten. The quick life of to-day sounding around the relics of antiquity, and overshadowed by the august traditions of a kingdom, makes Edinburgh more impressive than residence in any other British city. What a poem is that Princes Street! The puppets of the busy any-coloured hour move about on its pavement, while across the ravine Time has piled the Old Town, ridge on ridge, grey as a rocky coast washed and worn by the foam of centuries, peaked and jagged by gable and roof, windowed from basement to cope, the whole surmounted by St Giles's airy crown. The New is there looking at the Old. Two Times are brought face to face, and are yet separated by a thousand years. Wonderful on winter nights, when the gully is filled with darkness, and out of it rises, against the sombre blue and the frosty stars, that mass and bulwark of gloom, pierced and quivering with innumerable lights! There is nothing in Europe to match that. Could you but roll a river down the valley, it would be sublime. Finer still, to place one's self near the Burns' Monument and look toward the Castle. It is ore astonishing than an Eastern dream. A city rises up before you painted by fire on night. High on air a bridge of lights leaps the chasm; a few emerald lamps, like glowworms, are moving silently about in the railway station below; a solitary crimson one is at rest. That ridged and chimneyed bulk of blackness, with splendour bursting out at every pore, is the wonderful Old Town, where Scottish history mainly transacted itself; while, opposite, the modern Princes Street is blazing throughout its length. During the day the Castle looks down upon the city as if out of another world; stern with all its peacefulness, its garniture of trees, its slopes of grass. The rock is dingy enough in colour; but, after a shower, its lichens laugh out greenly in the returning sun, while the rainbow is brightening on the lowering sky beyond. How deep the shadow which the Castle throws at noon over the gardens at its feet where the children play! How grand when giant bulk and towery crown blacken against sunset! Fair, too, the New Town sloping to the sea. From George Street, which crowns the ridge, the eye is led down sweeping streets of stately architecture to the villas and woods that fill the lower ground and fringe the shore; to the bright azure belt of the Forth, with its smoking steamer or its creeping sail; beyond, to the shores of Fife, soft blue, and flecked with fleeting shadows in the keen clear light of spring, dark purple in the summer heat, tarnished gold in the autumn haze; and further away still, just distinguishable on the paler sky, the crest of some distant peak carrying the imagination into the illimitable world. ' The finest close view of the northern half of the city is seen at the head of the Castle Hill, from the N side of the Castle esplanade; or, still better, from the bomb-battery of the Castle itself, where the lovely space between the Old Town and the New appears almost perpendicularly under the eye, with the Scott Monument on its further verge, the Melville Monument rising a little beyond, and the greater part of the New Town all around. <P><BLOCKQUOTE><FONT SIZE="-1">'Saint Margaret, what a sight is here!<BR>Long lines of masonry appear;<BR> Scott's Gothic pinnacles arise.<BR> And Melvilie's statue greets the skies,<BR> And sculptured front and Greeian pile<BR> The pleased yet puzzled eye beguile;<BR> From yon far landscape where the sea<BR> Smiles on in softest witchery;<BR> Till, riant all, the hills of Fife<BR> Fill in the charms of country life.'</FONT></BLOCKQUOTE> <P><I>Geology.</I>&#151;Edinburgh has always been a favourite field for geological investigation. Ever since the days of Hutton, the volcanic rocks which are so well developed on Arthur's Seat, the Calton Hill, and at the Castle, have been the subject of careful study among geologists. The striking features to which these igneous rocks give rise, arrest the attention even of the non-scientific observer. Indeed, few cities present such remarkable facilities for examining the structure and physical relations of ancient volcanic rocks. The literature bearing on the geology of Edinburgh and its environs is rather voluminous. Amongst the various writers on the subject, the names of Hutton, Playfair, Sir James Hall, Hibbert, Jamieson, Hay Cunningham, Edward Forbes, Hugh Miller, Charles M `Laren, A. Geikie, R. Chambers, Miller Home, and Judd, may be entioned. Special reference ought to be made to the admirable volume on <I>The Geology of Fife and the Lothians,</I> by Charles M 'Laren, and to Professor A. Geikie's lucid description of the Geology of Edinburgh. * <P><FONT SIZE="-1"> * Geological Survey Memoir accompanying Sheet 32 of the 1-inch Map.</FONT> <P>With the exception of Blackford Hill, which is a continuation of the Lower Old Red Sandstone volcanic rocks of the Pentlands, the newer portion of Arthur's Seat, and several isolated veins of igneous rock, the solid rocks which underlie the city of Edinburgh and Leith belong to the lowest divisions of the Carboniferous system. On account of the strata being largely impregnated with lime, they were appropriately named by M 'Laren the Calciferous Sandstone Series-a term which is now generally applied to them. They may be arranged in three divisions:-

<TR> 
<TD>Red Sandstone<BR>Series. 
<TD>1. A lower division of red and mottled sandstones, red, green, and grey shales and marls, with calcareous nodules and bands merging occasionally into pure limestones. Coarse conglomerates occur at the base of this group. </TABLE> <P>The members of the lowest division occupy an irregular area, bounded by the Braid Hills on the S, Arthur's Seat on the E, and the Calton Hill on the N, while the western limit is sharply defined by the great fault extending from Craiglockhart north-eastwards by Merchiston and the Castle esplanade, to the NW slope of Calton Hill. Within this area the strata are arranged in the form of a low arch, the crest of which runs from Blackford Hill to St Andrew Square. As this anticlinal fold is truncated on the W by the fault just referred to, it is only on the E side of the arch that the complete succession can be traced. The lowest beds are exposed in the neighbourhood of Blackford Hill where they consist of conglomerates composed of pebbles, chiefly derived from the Old Red Sandstone volcanic rocks. They rest unconformably on these igneous rocks, and are not faulted against them as has hitherto been supposed. It is important to note that the strata to the W of Blackford Hill occupy a higher horizon than those on the E side. As we pass to the SW this overlap gradually increases till the members of the Upper or Cementstone Series rest directly on the Old Red Sandstone formation. This overlap indicates the gradual submergence of the Pentland ridge in the early part of the Carboniferous period. At the beginning of that period the Pentlands formed a promontory jutting far into the sea, in which the red sandstones were deposited, but eventually the ridge was submerged and buried beneath the accumulating sediment of the succeeding groups. Excellent sections of these basement conglomerates are to be seen at present in the cuttings of the new Suburban railway. <P>Next in order come the sandstones of Craigmillar, and the strata which are exposed in the southern part of the town, consisting of red sandstones with red and green marls. In the districts of Newington, Grange, the Meadows, and Warrender Park, these beds dip to the N at angles varying from 10 to 15 degrees, while to the W of these localities they dip to the NW-thus indicating the dome-shaped arrangement of the strata. Excellent sections have been recently exposed in the course of excavations in Warrender Park. They also occur in Gilmore Place with an inclination to the NW, and they reappear at the head of Keir Street with an easterly dip. The anticlinal axis must therefore run northwards between these two points. The same beds are well displayed on the S slope of the Castle esplanade as seen from Johnston Terrace. In this well-known section, the honeycombed sandstones with red and green marls are brought into conjunction with the plug of basalt on which the Castle stands, by the great fault already referred to. They dip to the E at an angle of from 15 to 20 degrees, but as they approach the fault they become horizontal, and eventually bend over till they conform to the hade of the fault which is inclined at an angle of 80 degrees to the NW. The SE slope of the plug of basalt is beautifully slickensided. The stri&aelig;, however, are not vertical, but are slightly inclined to the NE, showing a faint lateral thrust in that direction, as well as a downthrow to the NW. From the Castle eastwards to Holyrood and the Hunter's Bog there is a continuous easterly dip at an average angle of 15 degrees, where they pass conformably below the interbedded volcanic rocks of Arthur's Seat (division 2). Fossils rarely occur in the red sandstones. Fragments of wood have been found in the beds at Craigmillar, which are probably the remains of pine-like <I>Araucearia.</I> In the quarry above Salisbury Crags, a small <I>Estheria Peachii</I> was found by Mr Grieve. Under St Anthony's Chapel, in a bed crammed with vegetable matter, Mr Bryson found specimens of <I>Dadoxylon,</I> and Professor A. Geikie obtained fragments of <I>Poacites</I> and the remains of <I>Rhizodus Hibberti.</I> The beds at that locality lie above the first interbedded lava-flow, now represented by the Long Row, and it is probable, therefore, that they belong to the Cementstone Series. <P>Towards the close of the deposition of the red sandstones, volcanic activity seems to have begun in the neighbourhood of Edinburgh. From certain volcanic orifices, streams of lava and showers of ashes were ejected and spread over the sea-floor, which at intervals were commingled with ordinary sediment. The records of this volcanic action are still preserved to us on Arthur's Seat, the Calton Hill, and at Craiglockhart. These interbedded volcanic rocks must be carefully distinguished from the three great intrusive sheets of igneous rock which were injected between the red sandstones forming the western base of Arthur's seat. On account of their durability these intrusive sheets have more successfully resisted the denuding agencies than the intervening sandstones, and hence they now for the prominent escarpments of St Leonard's, Salisbury Crags, and the Dasses. The first outflow of lava is represented by the compact basalt of the Long Row which is overlaid by tuffs, volcanic breccias, and ashy sandstones which are well exposed at the Dry Dam. The general character of these volcanic ashes is different from the coarse agglomerate which now forms the higher part of the hill, and which was ejected at a much later date. The tuffs and ashy sandstones are succeeded by basaltic lavas and porphyrites, the latter forming the slopes of the Whinny Hill and Dunsappie. The junction of these rocks with the overlying shales and sandstones (division 3) is not seen on the eastern slope of Arthur's Seat, owing to the covering of superficial deposits. The evidence is supplied, however, by the section on Calton Hill. <P>The contemporaneous volcanic rocks of Arthur's Seat are truncated on the N side by an E and W fault-an offshoot from the main dislocation trending from Craiglockhart by the Castle to the NW slope of Calton Hill. This branching fault has a downthrow to the N, and by means of it the outcrop of the interbedded volcanic rocks of Arthur's Seat has been shifted about half a mile to the W as far as the Calton Hill. The existence of this fault was clearly proved several years ago in the course of draining operations along the Canongate, where a continuous section was exposed of red sandstones and marls, with a few dykes of igneous rock. The succession of the volcanic rocks of Calton Hill closely resembles that of Arthur's Seat. At the base there is a series of basaltic lavas and tuffs which are overlaid by porphyrites forming the higher part of the hill. To the E they are rapidly succeeded by black shales and sandstones (division 3) occurring in the gardens of Royal Terrace, while on the NW slope of the hill they are abruptly cut off by the great fault already described. <P>The strata of the upper division differ from the red sandstones in lithological character, and particularly in the greater abundance of fossils. Within the present area, the prominent members of the Cementstone Series are the white sandstones of Granton and Craigleith, and the Wardie shales. Beyond the limits of the Edinburgh district, it comprises the well-known oil shales of Midlothian and the Burdiehouse Limestone which has become celebrated for the great abundance of ichthyolites and crustaceans embedded in it. The occurrence of such a thick mass of limestone in the series, however, is quite exceptional, as the calcareous bands are usually found in seams only a few inches thick. It was formerly supposed that the sandstones of Granton and Craigleith occupied a higher horizon than the Wardie shales, but it is evident from recent investigations that they underlie the shales. On the shore, at Granton, the standstones form an arch the axis of which runs N and S. On the E side of the anticline they dip to the E, and are succeeded by thin bedded sandstones and shales which eventually pass underneath the Wardie shales. The latter are repeated by gentle undulations eastwards as far as Trinity. The sandstones at Craigleith are evidently the inland prolongations of those on the shore, as the strike of the beds is nearly N and S. In this quarry the beds dip both to the E and SW as if curving round an anticlinal fold. A characteristic feature of the sandstones at both localities is the presence of numerous remains of plants in a fragmentary for, one of the most abundant being <I>Spenopteris affinis.</I> Huge trunks of coniferous trees have also been obtained from these beds. These sandstones make excellent building material, and have been largely quarried for this purpose; indeed the greater part of Edinburgh has been built of this stone. <P>The Wardie beds consist of black and blue shales, in which are embedded nodules of clay ironstone. The nodules have yielded fish remains, coprolites, and plants. When these beds are traced inland, they become intercalated with bands of sandstone, but the shales form the essential feature of the subdivision. By means of the fault extending from Craiglockhart by the Castle to Calton Hill, the members of the Cementstone Series are brought into conjunction with successive beds of the Red Sandstone division. On the NW slope of the Calton Hill they are thrown against the volcanic series (division 2), while to the NE of that locality the effect of the displacement is to bring different members of the Cementstone Series against each other. It is evident therefore that the fault is decreasing in amount towards the NE. Along the W side of this fault the Wardie shales are generally inclined to the NW. In the neighbourhood of St Andrew Square, however, they form a well-marked anticline, which has already been referred to as the northern prolongation of the arch running southwards to Blackford Hill. In 1865 Mr G. C. Haswell recorded an interesting exposure on the W side of Hanover Street, at the corner of Rose Street, where the strata, consisting of sandstones, shales, and fireclay, form an anticline and syncline within a horizontal distance of about 12 feet. They were lately seen on the E side of Hanover Street, in the course of excavations at Rose Street, having a north-westerly dip at angles varying from 40 to 50 degrees. M 'Laren noted the occurrence of similar beds at the New Club in Princes Street. Upwards of 100 feet of dark shales dip to the NW at the West Church Manse. They crop out in the cuttings of the Caledonian and new Suburban railways, and they are also exposed at the Dean near the Dean Bridge. At these localities they are inclined to the NW, and a similar dip continues to near Coltbridge, which forms the centre of a synclinal fold. From this point westwards we have a gradually descending series towards the Corstorphine Hill and the Craigleith sandstones. <P>Reference has already been made to the fish remains and plants embedded in the ironstone nodules, but there are certain bands of shales in this subdivision, which are of special importance on account of the marine fauna which they have yielded. They occur at Granton, Craigleith, the Dean Bridge, Drumsheugh, and Woodhall, and at all these localities there is a marked identity in the species of fossils. These horizons have been explored by Messrs Henderson and Bennie, who bave collected a great variety of marine forms from them, upwards of 17 well-defined species having been disinterred from the Woodhall shales alone. Some of the species are typical of the Carboniferous Limestone, which overlies the Cementstone Series. The following fossils are characteristic of these beds: <I>Spirorbis carbonarius, Lingula squamiformis, L</I>. <I>mytiloides, Avicula Hendersoni, Myalina crass, Bellerophon decussatus, Murchisonia striatula, Orthoeras attenuatum, O</I>. <I>cylindraceum.</I> This assemblage of fossils is widely different from that met with in the Burdiehouse Limestone, which is essentially a fresh or brackish water deposit. Indeed, a careful examination of the fossils derived from the various members of the Cementstone Series seems to prove that during their deposition there must have been an alternation of estuarine and marine conditions. <P>The interbedded volcanic rocks at Craiglockhart are probably on the same horizon as those on Arthur's Seat and Calton. At the base there is a considerable development of felspathic tuff which is overlaid by basaltic lava. This latter rock, which is a coarse variety of basalt, presents features of great beauty when examined microscopically, showing prisms of labradorite with minute grains of augite. This mineral also occurs in distinct crystals, and the olivine, which is apparent even to the naked eye, is also well represented. These volcanic rocks are inclined to the NW, and are succeeded by sandstones and shales, while, on the N side, they are abruptly cut off by a fault. <P>The history of the intrusive igneous rocks of the Edinburgh district and the later volcanic rocks of Arthur's Seat is full of interest. Reference has already been made to the three great intrusive sheets of the Heriot Mount, Salisbury Crags, and the Dasses which belong to the period of volcanic activity towards the close of the deposition of the red sandstones. These rocks, which consist of coarsely crystalline dolerites, were not erupted at the surface like the contemporaneous lavas and tuffs of the Long Row, the Dry Dam, and Whinny Hill. Their intrusive character is clearly proved by their relations to the overlying and underlying strata. The sandstones and shales both above and below these sheets have been altered by contact with the, and the two lower ones gradually steal across the edges of the intervening strata till they unite to form the great columnar mass of Samson's Ribs. <P>But these igneous masses are of older date than those which cap the hill. There can be little doubt that the former belong to the period of volcanic activity at the close of the Red Sandstone Series. We have already pointed out that the older volcanic rocks of Arthur's Seat lie on the E side of the anticlinal axis, on which the S part of Edinburgh stands, and that they are regularly succeeded by the higher divisions of the Carboniferous system. Long before the eruption of the later volcanic materials, the older rocks had been tilted to the E, and had been subjected to prolonged denudation. A vast thickness of material had been removed. The softer sedimentary strata had been worn into hollows, and the harder igneous rocks of Salisbury Crags, the Dasses, and the Long Row projected as ridges before the renewal of volcanic activity. The later igneous rocks consist of coarse agglomerate and basalt, the former being ejected before the basalt. The coarse ash is admirably displayed in the Queen's Drive, where the blocks are extremely large, from an examination of which it is evident that they have been derived from the older rocks of the hill. On the top of Arthur's Seat there is a mass of basalt, filling the vent from which these coarse agglomerates were discharged. The basalt of the lion's haunch is part of a lava flow which rests on the agglomerate, and sends down a branching vein into it. No precise age can be assigned to these later ejections. All that can be safely averred is, that they are more recent than the Lower Carboniferous period. <P>The rock on which the Castle stands consists of a compact basalt with a marked columnar structure. It is an oval-shaped mass, which, save on the E side, is surrounded by beds of division 3, and on account of its greater hardness has ore successfully resisted denudation. It closely resembles many of the volcanic necks which are so common among the Scotch Carboniferous rocks. They represent the vents from which the lavas and ashes were discharged, and are now filled with tuff or crystalline rocks. The neck on which the Castle stands is abruptly truncated on the E side by the great fault which has been frequently referred to, and by means of this dislocation it must have been thrown down from a much higher level. <P>At various localities throughout Edinburgh veins and dykes of basalt and dolerite occur. Some of these have an E and W trend, and are probably of Tertiary age. One of these is exposed in the path leading up to the Calton Hill, at the hack of Greenside church, where it is intruded among the volcanic rocks of the hill. They are also to be seen in the Water of Leith near the Dean Bridge, and in the cutting of the Caledonian railway near Coltbridge. Several veins have been traced in the old part of the town: one from the foot of St Mary Street to St Patrick Square, and another from the eastern part of the Cowgate to the University. <P>The effects of glaciation are still fresh in the neighbourhood of Edinburgh. The rounded contour of the ground and the striated surfaces alike point to the operation of this agent. On the Corstorphine Hill several striated surfaces occur which were first observed by Sir James Hall, the direction of the markings being a few degrees N of E. At one point on the N side of the Castle, nearly horizontal stri&aelig; were observed on a vertical face of rock pointing in a similar direction. On the Calton Hill there are several examples. Till recently a striated surface was exposed at the side of the road leading to the Nelson Monument. Fresh instances have been met with lately at the side of the Low Calton, owing to the removal of the boulder clay, the general trend being ENE. In the Queen's Park they occur on the top of the Salisbury Crags, and the splendid <I>roehe moutonn&eacute;e</I> in the Queen's Drive, above Samson's Ribs, is now well known. A remarkable example of an overhanging cliff with a striated surface is to be seen on the road leading to Duddingston, in what is locally designated ' the Windy Gowl'- a phenomenon which could only have been produced by glacier ice. In the course of this year well-preserved stri&aelig; were observed by Mr B. N. Peach within 100 feet of the top of Arthur's Seat, at the top of the gully, known by the name of ' the Gutted Haddy.' Here the ice- markings ascend the slope at an angle of 20&deg; on a nearly vertical face of rock. The direction is E 18&deg; N, and from the appearances presented by the striated surfaces it is evident that they were produced by ice moving towards the ENE. At Craigmillar the stri&aelig; run approximately E and W; and again, on the Braid Hills, where they are very plentiful, the trend is to the S of E. 'Striated pavements' in the boulder clay have been observed both by Hugh Miller and Professor A. Geikie, indicating an ice movement in an ENE direction. All these instances prove that Edinburgh was glaciated by ice moving towards the E, while here and there slight local deflections were produced by the irregular contour of the ground. <P>The greatest accumulation of boulder clay is that which covers Princes Street. In the low-lying parts of the town it is buried beneath the alluvial deposits of ancient lochs or is overlapped by the accumulations of the raised beaches. Along the coast-line it crops out from underneath these marine deposits. A few years ago a fine exposure of boulder clay was made in the course of the excavations for the Albert Dock at Leith. It consisted of a tough dark clay charged with blocks of various sizes from widely separated localities. Along with the blocks of local origin there were stones which had come from Corstorphine Hill, the Mons Hill, Campsie Fells, and the Grampians. Similar evidence is obtained from the patches of boulder clay round Arthur's Seat. On the Queen's Drive, where the second escarpment begins leading down to Duddingston, there is a considerable thickness of this deposit overlying the Carboniferous red marls. It is fawn-coloured, and consists mainly of sandstone blocks associated with boulders of carboniferous limestone, fragments of coal, black shale, diabase, porphyrites, quartz rock pebbles from the neighbourhood of Callander, and schists from the Grampians. The same commingling of foreign and local rocks is observable in the small patch, in the gully, named 'the Gutted Haddy,' at a height of over 700 feet. This locality is considerably above the level of the sources from which some of the blocks have been derived, so that they could not have been transported by the agency of floating ice. <P>The deposits of the 100 feet beach lap round the hills on which Edinburgh stands, their inland margin never rising much above this level. They consist of a great series of stratified sands and clays which once formed an almost continuous plain, but which has been trenched and worn into hollows by prolonged denudation. Where a section can be obtained it is evident that the mounds on which the marine deposits rest have been carved out of the solid rock. Though the finely stratified sands predominate in these beds, yet in places they wholly consist of finely laminated clay free from stones. Occasionally there are layers of small stones as if they had been dropped into the accumulating sediment by floating ice. These are mostly local, but a few have been transported from the Grampians. Some chalk stones and chalk flints also occur in the clays, the former resembling the Danish chalk in the island of Faxoe. One of the best sections for examining this deposit is the clay pit at Portobello. In this section there are certain bands highly crumpled, while the beds above and below are undisturbed. Last year an excellent exposure was seen in Warriston Park, nearly opposite the gate leading into the Botanic Garden, where several layers of these crumpled beds occurred, -the intervening layers of sand being free from any contortion. The folds were mostly inverted, and inclined to the SW. These phenomena may be accounted for by supposing that, during the deposition of these beds, they were occasionally subjected to the movement of pack ice driven on to the banks of sand and mud during low tide by the NE winds blowing up the Firth. The partly consolidated clays were pushed laterally by the ice as it was driven shorewards. As the ice floated or melted away, the crumpled clays were again overlaid by ordinary sediment. The crumpling might recur at intervals with severe weather, a low tide, and NE winds. This supposition is strengthened by an examination of the contents of the beds. The shells are of an arctic type, and are not abundant; while the Foraminifera and Entomostraca are also arctic. The clays consist of the finest sediment - the flour of the rocks, in fact, and are almost destitute of organic matter. They point to a time when the rivers flowing into the Forth were turbid with glacial mud, when the land surface was nearly devoid -of vegetation, and when the estuary was not suitable for the growth of alg&aelig; <P>The 50 feet beach has been carved out of the deposits of the older terrace, the underlying boulder clay, and the solid rock. It forms a narrow strip along the coast, the broadest part occurring at the Leith Links. This ancient beach is bounded by a low inland cliff which is still tolerably steep where it consists of solid rock, but in those places where it is carved out of boulder clay, or the 100 feet terrace, it is merely a sloping bank. The strata consist of sand and gravel with occasional shells. Hugh Miller drew attention to some interesting facts connected with the old beach near Fillyside Bank between Leith and Portobello. The stones found on the surface are encrusted by <I>Serpul&oelig;</I> and perforated by <I>Saxicava,</I> while the under valves of oysters are fre quently attached to the boulders. Equally interesting is the occurrence of <I>Mya truncata,</I> which has been preserved with the siphuncular end uppermost in the act of burrowing in the boulder clay which forms the floor of the beach at this point. In all likelihood this part of the old sea bottom may have formed an oyster scalp. The localities where these shells occur are from 4 to 8 feet above the highest stream tides, and from 30 to 38 feet above the position where they are now found living. The elevation of the land to its present level seems to have taken place since its occupation by an, for in the continuation of this beach farther up the Firth numerous skeletons of whales have been found along with the rude implements which were used by our ancestors. A few years ago, a whale was discovered near Gargunnock, the brain of which, in all probability, had been extracted for food, the skull having been broken open at the thinnest part. Hard by was found the implement which had evidently been used for this purpose. A comparison of the marks on the face of the implement with those on the skull showed that they perfectly agreed. Kitchen middens are found at various places along the base of the cliff forming the inner margin of this terrace. The bed of oyster shells referred to by M `Laren as occurring at Seafield is in all probability of this nature. It is rather a remarkable fact that the brick clays belonging to this beach have a fetid odour owing to the amount of animal and vegetable atter they contain. At the head of the Leith Links there are several dunes of blown sand which date back to the time when the sea rolled inwards on this beach. <P>In the course of the excavation of its present channel, the Water of Leith has formed several alluvial terraces which belong to post-glacial and recent times, the highest, of course, being the oldest. The successive terraces are best developed where the river has cut through the deposits of the 100 feet sea beach. The lower portion of the Warriston Cemetery occupies one of these higher terraces. In connection with this subject it is interesting to note the occurrence of a buried river channel near Coltbridge, which was proved by a series of bores put down by Mr Jeffrey. One bore, which was sunk to the S of the brewery, passed through 60 feet of superficial deposits before reaching the sandstones and shales. In a second bore, a short distance to the N, 72 feet of drift were pierced when a dyke of igneous rock was reached. A few yards further N a third bore was put down through 200 feet of superficial deposits before reaching the solid rock. As the surface of the ground at that locality is only about 150 feet above the sea, it is evident that the bottom of this old channel must be considerably below the present datum-line. This is evidently one of those buried river-channels, of which there are several examples on the E coast of Scotland and England, pointing to a considerable elevation of the land, probably in pre-glacial times. <P>Edinburgh formerly possessed several sheets of water which have now disappeared. The hollow along which the North British Railway passes was occupied by a chain of lochs. The Nor' Loch, to the N of -the Castle, was celebrated as the place where the witches passed through their ordeal. The Grassmarket and the Cowgate overlie the alluvium of an ancient loch, the traces of which are now almost obliterated. In the Queen's Park, the place known as the King's Mire was covered by a sheet of water. The Meadows occupy the site of the Borough Loch, the shell marl being occasionally exposed in the drains there, varying in thickness from a few inches to 6 feet. Several species of <I>Limn&oelig;a, Planorbis, Cyclas</I>, and <I>Valvata</I> have been obtained from this deposit, along with a few valves of Entomostraca. The skull and horns of the <I>Cervus Elephas</I> have also been disinterred from the alluvial deposits of the Meadows. This interesting relic is now preserved in the Museum of the Antiquarian Society in Edinburgh. A large sheet of water formerly extended from Corstorphine to Gorgie and Coltbridge, which has been drained by the gorge of the Water of Leith. An interesting notice occurs in the <I>Scotsman</I> of 13 April 1833, with reference to the occurrence of a considerable depth of moss in the old town. In the course of the excavations of the new court buildings in Parliament Square, a remnant of the City Wall, erected in 1450, was laid bare; and in the mossy soil below it, about 3 feet under the foundation, a number of entire skeletons were found, showing that the ground had been used for burial before the wall was built. In some places the moss was 15 feet deep. <P>Though the physical features of Edinburgh were mainly determined in pre-glacial times, there can be little doubt that they were largely modified during the glacial period. Those remarkable features of 'crag and tail', which are well displayed on the Castle rock, the Calton Hill, Salisbury Crags, and Arthur's Seat, were partly developed during the great extension of the ice. In the foregoing examples the projecting crags or bosses of rock face the W, which is the direction from which the ice came; while the ridge or 'tail' on the lee side slopes gently towards the E. As the ice impinged on these projecting masses, the lower portion of the sheet would be deflected and compelled to move round the sides, while the higher portion would overflow the escarpments. One can readily understand that the erosion would necessarily be greatest at the base and round the sides of the crags. The Nor' Loch and the Grassmarket Loch were probably rock basins due to this cause. The hollow at the Meadows may likewise be of glacial origin. At that locality the strike of the beds nearly coincides with the direction of the ice-flow; and as the red sandstones crop out to the S in Warrender Park, it is probable that they are overlaid by softer strata occupying the site of the Meadows, which would be more readily excavated by the ice. And so also the hollow at Morningside must have been deepened by the pressure of the ice escaping round the N end of Blackford Hill. Indeed it is rather remarkable that the hollows and ancient lochs throughout Edinburgh are found in those places where they ought theoretically to occur, on the supposition that the district was glaciated by an ice sheet moving in an ENE direction. <P><I>Botany.</I>&#151;The flora within a radius of twenty-five miles around the city of Edinburgh is most varied and extensive. From the nature of the soil, elevation, and exposure, this might be expected. There are the shores of the Firth of Forth and many fresh-water rivers&#151; there are extensive ranges of hills&#151;there are plains, woods, valleys, moors, and cultivated lands, all of which have their peculiar native vegetable productions. There has been recently enumerated 410 genera, 1012 species, and 80 varieties of flowering plants. This number, however, embraces several plants not indigenous, but which have escaped from cultivation, and have become naturalised in different localities. Of Ferns and their allies there are 18 genera and 43 species and varieties. These include the forked spleenwort, the alternate spleenwort, the filmy fern, the sea spleenwort, the adder's tongue, the moonwort fern, etc. There are 520 species and varieties of mosses, liverworts, lichens, and charas. The Firth of Forth is rich in seaweeds (Algae), but their numbers have not recently been calculated. The forms of fungi, desmids, and diatoms are innumerable. Woodforde first published a catalogue of plants found around Edinburgh; and about the same time Dr Greville issued his <I>Flora Edinensis</I>, containing descriptions of the flowering and flowerless plants met with within ten miles of the city. This was an excellent book, and is still (1882) a work of reference. The last publication on the botany was that of Balfour and Sadler in 1871, entitled <I>The Flora of Edinburgh</I>, intended for the use of students attending the Botanical Classes. In 1761, when Dr John Hope was appointed professor of botany, he encouraged his pupils to study and collect the wild plants in the neighbourhood of Edinburgh, and offered a medal annually for the best collection of dried plants. The medal was gained on one occasion by Sir James Edward Smith. The practice of giving a medal has been continued by all the succeeding professors. <P><I>Local Advantages.</I>&#151;The situation of Edinburgh is scarcely less subservient to advantage than its scenery is replete with beauty. The sloping inclination of the ground on all hands, with its close neighbourhood to the sea, is favourable to drainage, and affords facilities for cleanliness. The elevation of the hills, with the spacious natural funnels that intervene, is provocative of a constant stir in the air, and contributes to a healthy ventilation. The comparative vicinity of coal fields and of seaports, with the easy access there is to these, offers ready facilities for manufacture and commerce, such as ight well tempt capitalists to essay here enterprises which have long been successfully prosecuted in towns far less favourably situated, such as Dunfermline, Hawick, and even Manchester, Leeds, and Sheffield, not to say Birmingham, and others which might be mentioned. As it is, the resources it possesses for a generous education, its varied natural stores, its splendid scenery, its historical associations, native to itself and as the capital of the country, as well as its institutions, expressly established, thoroughly equipped, and in active operation for this end, are such as to enable Edinburgh to compete with any other city as a seat of learning. If we add to these its tranquil air and its social atmosphere, as well as its museums, libraries, and schools of arts, there are few places better fitted for the cultivation of those studies which are best prosecuted away from the hum of busy labour, and the hurry and bustle of merely commercial life. ' Residence in Edinburgh,' remarks Alexander Smith, ' is an education in itself. Of all British cities - Weimar-like in its intellectual and &aelig;sthetic leanings, Florence-like in its freedom from the stains of trade, and more than Florencelike in its beauty - it is the one best suited for the conduct of a lettered life. The city, as an entity, does not stimulate like London; the present moment is not nearly so intense; life does not roar and chafe - it murmurs only; and this interest of the hour, mingled with something of the quietude of distance and the past - which is the spiritual atmosphere of the city - is the most favourable of all conditions for intellectual work or intellectual enjoyment.' ' What the tour of Europe was necessary to see elsewhere,' says Sir David Wilkie, ' I now find congregated in this one city. Here are alike the beauties of Prague and of Salzburg; here are the romantic sites of Orvietto and Tivoli; and here is all the magnificence of the admired bays of Genoa and Naples; here, indeed, to the poet's fancy, may be found realised the Roman Capitol and the Grecian Acropolis.' And, says Mr Hallam:&#151; <P><BLOCKQUOTE><FONT SIZE="-1">'Even thus, methinks, a city reared should be,<BR> Yea, an imperial city, that might hold<BR>Five times a hundred noble towns in fee,<BR> And either with their might of Babel old<BR>Or the rich Roman pomp of Empery,<BR> Might stand compare, highest in arts enrolled,<BR>Highest in arms, brave tenement for the free,<BR> Who never crouch to thrones, or sin for gold.<BR>Thus should her towers be raised, with vicinage<BR> Of clear bold hills, that curve her very streets,<BR> As if to vindicate ' mid choicest seats<BR>Of art, abiding nature's majesty, -<BR> And the broad sea beyond, in calm or rage,<BR> Chainless alike, and teaching liberty.'</FONT></BLOCKQUOTE> <P>The walks and shrubberies and public gardens, also, are rich in objects of natural interest. Robinias, liriodendrons, auracarias, and some other rare ligneous plants which are as familiar here as oaks and elms are elsewhere, bespeak the regard of the curious in the matter of trees; while rare flowering plants and shrubs, continually under the eye, render it in a measure familiar with the productions of foreign climes. <P><I>Climate.</I>&#151;The climate of Edinburgh is much the same as that all over the E coast of Scotland, but rather colder than in the low-lying environs. Some spots in the city, as compared with others - for example, Holyrood as compared with the Castle, and Newington as compared with Broughton - are sheltered and war. The Astronomer Royal states that ' the average mean annual temperature about the observatory on the Calton Hill is approximately 46.0 Fahr.; the <I>annual rainfall,</I> 24 -0 inches yearly. The strength and quantity of the wind on and about the site are excessive, almost all through the year, an d whatever quarter the winds blows from.' Easterly winds prevail in April and May, sometimes also in March; and are usually cold and dry, often very chilling, and occasionally accompanied by injurious fogs called <I>haars.</I> Westerly and south-westerly winds prevail in all the other months, and are usually genial, but often highly charged with moisture. In one year, which probably was not far from being an average one, northerly winds blew 10 days, northeasterly winds 18 days, easterly winds l01 &frac12; days, south-easterly winds 14 days, southerly winds 42 days, south-westerly winds 30 &frac12; days, westerly winds 138 days, north-westerly winds 11 days. Thunder-storms come almost invariably from the S, and occur mostly in the latter part of May and throughout June; but in summer, when easterly or northerly winds prevail, thunderstorms rarely occur near the city; these spend their force considerably to the W or to the N. The salubrity of the climate, or the aggregate effect of it upon health and life, will afterwards be shown in a section on the related statistics. <P><I>The City Walls.</I>&#151;A very ancient wall ran northward from the foot of the Castle esplanade to the Nor' Loch, and another probably from the E end of the Nor' Loch to the foot of Leith Wynd; and these, with the intermediate reach of the Nor' Loch, and with a continuous range of houses from the foot of Leith Wynd to the head of Canongate or foot of High Street, defended the ancient city on its northern or most assailable side. A wall, entirely surrounding the old city, was constructed in 1450, under authority from James II., and by means of a tax on the inhabitants. This commenced with a small fortress at the NE base of the Castle rock; thence ran eastward, along the S side of the Nor' Loch, till nearly opposite the foot of the Castle esplanade; it then proceeded in a southerly direction till it gained the summit of the hill, where it was intersected by a gateway, communicating between the Castle and the town; thence it ran obliquely down the hill, toward the SE, till it arrived at the first turn in the descent of the West Bow, and there was intersected by a gateway, called the Upper Bow Port; it thence proceeded nearly due eastward, along the face of the ridge between High Street and Cowgate, till it struck Gray's Close or Mint Close; thence went north-eastward till it touched the foot of High Street, a little W of the head of Leith Wynd, and there was intersected by a gateway, communicating between the city and Canongate;. it thence went down the W side of Leith Wynd to the valley; and then proceeded westward, along the S side of the Nor' Loch, to a junction with its commencement at the NE base of the Castle rock. The ancient city was thus confined to very narrow limits; consisted simply of Castle Hill, Lawnmarket, and High Street, with the closes or alleys leading from them; and was dependent for further extension, not on extending its buildings along the surface, but on raising them up in the air. <P>An extension-wall, chiefly for enclosing suburbs which had arisen on the S, was erected in 1513. This began at the SE base of the Castle rock; thence extended, in a south-easterly direction, to the W end of Grassmarket, where it was intersected by a gateway, called the West Port; thence ascended part of the eminence flanking the S side of Grassmarket, turned eastward, and went along the S side of what is now the park of Heriot's Hospital; it next, on approaching Bristo Street, turned northward, and traversed the eastern part of what is now the Greyfriars' Cemetery; it then trended eastward, pass</FONT></DIV>
