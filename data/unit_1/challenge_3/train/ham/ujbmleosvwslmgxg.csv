		<h2>UNDERGRADUATE STUDY AT THE GSA</h2><p>At the GSA we give you freedom and independence within an intellectually challenging and stimulating environment, to explore ideas and realise your potential.</p><p>We offer a practice-led, project driven, studio-based learning experience that will challenge your creative powers, develop your talents, and ultimately give your work a professional edge - a highly charged creative environment which will impact on your work.</p><p>Join us for a journey that will take you on a learning experience that will last you a lifetime. </p><h2>SCHOOL OF DESIGN</h2><p>Design engages with the world around us and discovers opportunities for positive change. Studying design at The Glasgow School of Art enables students to actively participate in shaping our world.  </p><p>Design at the GSA covers a wide spectrum of activity. From silversmithing, jewellery design and ceramics to products, interiors and textiles, graphic design, illustration and photography, the diversity of our specialisms is bound together by a common goal - to enable students to achieve excellence in their chosen field. </p><p>Learning and teaching is studio-based, complemented by a programme of Historical and Critical Studies, with visiting lecturers, critics and honorary professors.  Studying design at GSA encourages self-motivation and sustained independent learning. Each programme employs a variety of learning and teaching methods including lectures, seminars, talks, presentations <br />and group discussions, individual or group tutorials, projects, practical workshops and critical reviews that fully engage with the different subject areas. </p><p>GSA Design School students are successful and a high number go on to postgraduate study, while others choose to develop their career in the creative industries with many setting up their own businesses or working for major international companies. Our students show work annually at New Designers and D&amp;AD in London, at Premier Vision, Paris, and have been invited to exhibit at the Furniture Fair in Milan.</p><p>Professor Irene McAra McWilliam <br />MA FRSA<br />Head of the School of Design</p><h2>HONORARY PROFESSORS </h2><p>Professor Tony Franks  <br />Emeritus Professor, <br />Edinburgh College of Art<br />Professor Josephine Green  <br />Director of Trends and Strategy, <br />Phillips Electronics, Holland<br />Professor Russell Mills RCA   <br />Multimedia Artist, Cumbria</p><h2>HONORARY PROFESSOR - HISTORICAL + CRITICAL STUDIES</h2><p>Professor Guy Julier  <br />Professor of Design, Leeds School of Architecture, Landscape and Design</p><h2>SENIOR RESEARCHER</h2><p>Professor Alastair Macdonald</p><ul><li><b>The Glasgow School of Art has not only been an education but an experience which has allowed me to develop both artistically and socially. </b>Ruth Hollywood Silversmithing + Jewellery 4th Year</li></ul><h2>TEACHING + LEARNING + ASSESSMENT</h2><p>In the School of Design we believe that the studio remains at the core of your learning and teaching experience at The Glasgow School of Art.  Although new technologies allow more flexibility in how and where we create work, the studio environment is the place which allows face-to-face discourse, debate and  practice-based learning.</p><p>Throughout the BA (Hons) Design programme you will be involved in studio projects which are designed to increase your levels of knowledge, skills and under-standing in your chosen subject specialisms. In particular we are concerned with the changing nature of design in the 21st century and preparing you for the contexts within which you will operate in the future.</p><p>The department of Historical and Critical Studies underpins studio practice through lectures series and group discussion.  Assessment is normally by essay or student presentation. In year four you will undertake an individually supervised extended essay.</p><p>We place equal emphasis on learning and teaching, and as you progress through the programme you will be required to take increasing responsibility for your learning through personally negotiated programmes of study.</p><p>Throughout the programme we use a number of different ways to develop skills and critical thinking, for example, lectures, group discussion, formal seminar presentations, often involving visiting lecturers and guest speakers from the UK and internationally, field trips, placements, international exchanges and, importantly, the one-to-one tutorial.</p><p>In years two, three and four most of your studies will take place within your specialist departments and the department of Historical and Critical Studies, however there are regular cross-school seminars and opportunities for joint, inter-departmental projects, such as the international workshops held annually in various European venues.</p><p>Formative (ie advisory) assessments take place at key points throughout the year;  summative (final, graded) assessment takes place at the end of each academic year.</p><p>You can expect both a demanding and rewarding educational experience within the School of Design which will allow you, as a graduate, to enter your chosen career with confidence in your skills and a high degree of sensibility in relating to the issues and challenges facing contemporary designers.</p><p>Resources include laser welding equipment within Silversmithing and Jewellery, access to the Centre for Advanced Textiles, equipped with a state-of-the-art Stork Amethyst digital printer, computer access for glaze technology within ceramics, rapid prototyping equipment and excellent IT facilities which are constantly updated to keep abreast of technological developments within the design professions.</p><p>Teaching, learning and assessment in Product Design and Product Design Engineering follows a similar format and this is outlined within the departmental sections within this prospectus.</p><ul><li>Learning takes place within the studio environment with dedicated space for each student, supported by a range of technical facilities and workshops which provide access to a wide range of technical processes appropriate to the subject supported by qualified technical staff. </li></ul><h2>CAREERS + ALUMNI</h2><p>Design graduates go on to have careers as diverse as the subjects they study. many go on to specialise in their chosen subject - and become highly successful as a result - while others use their studies as a springboard for success in the wider business sphere.</p><ul><li>80% of GSA graduates said that their main subject of study was very useful or useful in finding suitable employment</li><li>78% OF GSA GRADUATES are in full-time work</li><li>28% of GSA graduates are self-employed</li><li><b>GSA Graduate Destination Survey 1999-2004, November 2005</b></li></ul><p><b>4C design Product design consultancy</b><br />4c design, was set up in 2001 by GSA PDE Graduates. Together they have won the Shell LiveWire 'Business Growth Challenge', Deustche Pyramid Award, RSA design award, and a Smart Award from the Scottish Executive to develop innovative new products.</p><p>Design graduates go on to successful careers as:<br />product designers, jewellers, lecturers, teachers, graphic designers, website designers, fashion designers, textile designers, car designers, ceramicists, musicians, film makers, set/costume designers, entrepreneurs.</p><p>Here are some of our successful graduates:</p><ul><li>Katarina Barac Product Design, 1994Founder, One Foot Taller</li><li>Evelyn Barbour Interior Design Theatre Designer</li><li>Nicola Becci Silversmithing + Jewellery, 1992 Jewellery Designer</li><li>Kerr Blyth Interior Design, 1993 Founder, Kerr Blyth Associates</li><li>Ian Callum Industrial Design, 1977 Head of Design, Jaguar Cars</li><li>Peter Capaldi Graphics (Visual Communication) Actor, director, writer</li><li>Tony Coffield Interior Design, 1997 Designer Curious Group</li><li>Andy Dunlop Silversmithing + Jewellery, 1994 Musician, Travis</li><li>Tom Elliot Ceramics, 1993 Founder Fireworks Ceramics</li><li>Innes Ferguson Product Design, 1987 Head of Design, London Transport</li><li>Neil Fullarton Graphics, 1994 (Visual Communication) Founder, Squigee textile design</li><li>Muriel Gray Graphic Design, 1979 (Visual Communication) TV presenter, journalist, novelist</li><li>Dorothy Hogg Silversmithing + Jewellery, 1967 Head of Silversmithing + Jewellery, ECA</li><li>Janice Kirkpatrick Graphics, 1984 (Visual Communication) Founder, Graven Images design practice</li><li>Andrew Lauder Product Design Engineering, 1995 Product Designer, Apple Computers</li><li>David Law Product Design Engineering, 1991 Product Designer, Speck Design</li><li>Jo Leviten Ceramics, 2000 Arts Development Manager North Ayrshire Council  </li><li>Alastair Macdonald Product Design, 1978 Head of PDE, GSA</li><li>Natasha Marshall Printed &amp; Knitted Textiles, 1996  Founder, Squigee textile design</li><li>Alastair McCauley,  Paul Simmons Textiles, 1988 Founder, Timorous Beasties</li><li>Nicola McGhee Printed &amp; Knitted Textiles, 1995 Senior Designer, GAP</li><li>Norman McLaren Design Filmmaker, founded National Film Board of Canada </li><li>Matthew Ringland Product Design, 1993 Design Director, The Tussaud's Group</li><li>Patrick Ryan Printed &amp; Knitted Textiles, 1986 Founder, Yab-Yum fashion house</li><li>Jonathan Saunders Printed and Knitted Textiles, 2000 Textile/fashion designer</li><li>Tom Scott Product Design Car designer; previously Design Director, Ford Motor Company</li></ul><h2>FIRST YEAR PROGRAMME FOR:</h2><h2>CERAMICS, INTERIOR DESIGN, SILVERSMITHING + JEWELLERY, TEXTILES, </h2><h2>VISUAL COMMUNICATION, PRODUCT DESIGN, PRODUCT DESIGN ENGINEERING </h2><h2>BA (HONS) DESIGN</h2><p><b>CO-ORDINATOR </b><br /><b>OF FIRST YEAR</b><br />Ronda Bayley <br />BA (Hons) MA RCA</p><p>First Year Design is the first year of the 4 year BA (Hons) Design programme and includes students of Ceramics, Interior Design, Silversmithing &amp; Jewellery, Textiles and Visual Communication.</p><p>There are around 85 students in a year group and students are introduced to design in a forum that is cross-disciplinary. This is academically and socially civilising, ensuring that throughout your time at the GSA, you will have a range of friendships that cross the boundaries of your specialism. These friendships and professional contacts will last you a lifetime.  </p><p>The shared language of design promotes interdepartmental and interdisciplinary conversation, enabling students to develop their own aesthetic language, where the focus is on communication of the image, the object and the space. </p><p>The programme encourages individuality and intellectual engagement with the design process. We look at the fundamental building blocks of design through a variety of deceptively simple projects and while we encourage innovative low-tech responses, we also acknowledge developing technologies. Students undertake an innovative collaborative project with the Department of Historical and Critical Studies which encourages students to reflect upon the position of their own work in a broader cultural context. </p><p>First Year Design is taught by a team of staff from a variety of design backgrounds. They are all active practitioners, working within the creative community and industries in Glasgow, Scotland and internationally. This brings a professional context into your studies from day one.</p><p>An important aspect of the course is orientation, specifically within design practice, and generally within the city. This is consolidated on an annual study trip.</p><p><b>COURSE INFORMATION</b></p><p>Our First Year programme introduces you to a wide range of practical and intellectual skills you will use over the four years of the BA (Hons) Design course. Through individual study and group interaction, Year 1 aims to introduce</p><ul><li>historical and critical studies as contexts for the study of Art and Design</li><li>fundamental design skills in systematic study and the experience of learning through a project-based programme, centred around studio-practice</li><li>communication skills - visual, oral and written - fundamental to the study of Design</li><li>basic information gathering methods and interpretation skills including the use of Information and Communication Technology (ICT)</li><li>the importance of self-motivation and effective time-management</li><li>the concept of professional practice</li></ul><p>The programme also allows you to test and confirm your choice of specialism.</p><h2>CERAMICS</h2><h2>BA (HONS) DESIGN</h2><p>UCAS INFORMATION<br />Institution Name: <br />GSA<br />Institution Code: <br />G43<br />UCAS Code: <br />E270<br />Route: <br />B</p><p><b>ACTING HEAD </b><br /><b>OF DEPARTMENT</b><br />Bill Brown<br />DA PgDip</p><p>Clay can be described as a unique carrier of cultural information and personal vision. Throughout history it has been used to create everything from small, utilitarian vessels to large, architectural structures. </p><p>Its sheer versatility combined with technological developments and design ingenuity means that <br />ceramics retain a central role in everyday life in almost every society worldwide. </p><p>At the GSA, we are passionate about giving our students the freedom to explore ideas and the facilities to carry them through. As a material-based discipline, we believe that ceramics offers a unique route to design through developing the skills of the maker and knowledge of those materials. Our students are encouraged to extend the boundaries of current practice by combining traditional skills with a critical understanding and appreciation of new techniques and technology to take new ideas from concept to reality. An internationally recognised department, we offer an exceptionally high level of support, inspiration and critical analysis to each of our students during their personal development. </p><p>The programme includes lectures in technical studies, professional practice and history of ceramics, field and gallery visits and in Year 3, the chance to undertake a three-month international exchange.</p><p>YEAR 1<br />First Year Design programme.</p><p>YEAR 2<br />Projects to develop competencies in a range of skills and techniques associated with ceramic production (ie hand-building, wheel throwing, mould making, slip casting and simple printmaking); appreciation of the importance of research and development in project work.</p><p>YEAR 3<br />Projects to develop practical skills; understanding of the opportunities and expectations of the ceramics profession <br />(eg the relationship between food presentation and ceramics, or ceramics in an architectural or gallery context).

A series of short projects help students to put theory into practice and begin to develop <br />appropriate practical skills.</p><p>YEAR 3<br />Complex projects provide an holistic understanding of design and the creative integration of conceptual ideas and practical obligations, with emphasis on constructional detailing skills. Exhibitions, and consultancy projects provide experience of designing in a professional context. Study trip.</p><p>YEAR 4<br />Students complete a folio of projects for final degree assessment which demonstrates a comprehensive range of conceptual and practical skills. Professional practice seminars prepare students for beginning their careers.</p><h2>SILVERSMITHING + JEWELLERY</h2><h2>BA (HONS) DESIGN</h2><p>UCAS INFORMATION<br />Institution Name: <br />GSA<br />Institution Code: <br />G43<br />UCAS Code: <br />E721<br />Route: <br />B</p><p><b>HEAD OF DEPARTMENT</b><br />Jack Cunningham <br />BA TQFE</p><p>Our reasons for decorating the body are wide-ranging and complex. Historically, people have expressed themselves through relatively superficial body adornment to extremely sophisticated symbols as a means of communicating the concept of position, rank, status, etc. </p><p>Contemporary studio jewellers continue to challenge perceived boundaries and use the artefact as a way of defining a personal response to social and cultural issues such as gender, relationships, politics, and the environment. Similarly, silversmiths explore this interaction between fine metalworking and ideas, through the vehicle of the functional domestic object. </p><p>The department embraces this diversity through informed debate and discussion. It encourages students to develop a personal approach to the research and development of lively design solutions together with a knowledge of traditional and cutting edge technology and skill acquisition. </p><p>Whether they intend to enter the broad based jewellery and silverware industries, pursue personal expression through the gallery market or continue in academia, students will develop their skills in a supportive and confident department.</p><p>YEAR 1<br />First Year Design programme.</p><p>YEAR 2<br />Introduction to a wide range of techniques and processes. Core conceptual and observation drawing programme. Development of personal design focus. Annual student exhibition.</p><p>YEAR 3<br />Students refine and add to skills learned during Year 2 with emphasis on design development and submissions to national student competitions. <br />Core technical programme. Weekly seminars. International field trip and annual student exhibition.</p><p>YEAR 4<br />A largely self-directed programme, under staff supervision, students complete a body of work which demonstrates a comprehensive range of conceptual and practical skills. Professional practice seminars prepare students for the 'New Designers' exhibition in London and life beyond the GSA.</p><h2>TEXTILES</h2><h2>BA (HONS) DESIGN</h2><p>UCAS INFORMATION<br />Institution Name: <br />GSA<br />Institution Code: <br />G43<br />UCAS Code: <br />E231<br />Route: <br />B</p><p><b>Head of Department</b><br />Jimmy Stephen-Cran <br />BA (Hons) MA</p><p>Today's Textile Design students honour and learn from tradition but look to the future at the same time.  Students learn to balance originality of concept with viability, the freedom of drawing with disciplined and expert technical skills and the need to identify and locate a contextual position for their design ideas. Our students are encouraged to stretch and challenge new technologies as they emerge but are free also to reject technology in favour of labour intensive handwork and limited production.</p><p>The approach at The Glasgow School of Art is unique in the UK, as it allows students to experience working in the four different disciplines of weave, print, knit and embroidery before specialising.  This gives our students a broad skills base and a thorough understanding of the structure and surface aspects of textile design to prepare them for successful careers within the international arena of textiles or postgraduate study.</p><p>Our students use well resourced workshops to acquire skills in weave, print (screen and transfer), knit, embroidery, dye chemistry and CAD, and each student has an individual workstation within spacious design studios, plus access to the Centre for Advanced Textiles (CAT) with two state of  the art Stork Sapphire digital printers, where they receive software training.</p><p>In Year 3, students have the chance to participate in exciting live projects and, in the past, have had the opportunity to exhibit at Premiere Vision, Paris and Surtex, New York. The Textiles Department fashion show is one of Glasgow's most exciting and 'must see' events.</p><p>YEAR 1<br />First Year Design programme.</p><p>YEAR 2<br />Acquisition of practical skills using a hands-on approach.<br /> Introduction to the four textile specialisms (print, weave,<br />knit and embroidery), CAD, sewing and making. </p><p>YEAR 3<br />Designing for specific markets/purposes. 'Live' briefs <br />and national competitions covering fashion and interior textiles. Visits to international design fairs and work placements are encouraged. Acquisition of key and professional skills.</p><p>YEAR 4<br />Self-directed study culminating in a substantial body of<br />work for degree assessment and for the 'New Designers'<br />Exhibition, London.</p><h2>VISUAL COMMUNICATION</h2><h2>BA (HONS) DESIGN</h2><p>UCAS INFORMATION<br />Institution Name: <br />GSA<br />Institution Code: <br />G43<br />UCAS Code: <br />E213<br />Route: <br />B</p><p><b>Head of Department</b><br />Paul Stickley <br />BA (Hons) MPhil (RCA)</p><p>Never before has the communications arena had such fluidity for the realisation of student ideas and professional identity. Simple or complex, witty or profound - visual communication is a platform for the thinking of tomorrow. </p><p>Digital technology has provided a multimedia, multi-layered set of opportunities for graphic design, illustration and photography. Students now incorporate the traditional skills of drawing, printing, photography and other graphic processes with video, sound, animation and other aspects of moving image and multimedia. </p><p>At the GSA, we are concerned with the fundamental characteristics of illustration, photography and graphic design, focusing on how and where these elements intersect. </p><p>To develop a vision of the future, students need an understanding of the past so each area within Visual Communication encourages a critical engagement with historic and contemporary practice, relating social cultural and political contexts.</p><p>YEAR 1<br />First Year Design programme.</p><p>YEAR 2<br />Studio projects to explore visual thinking, narrative form, word and image. Typography. Introduction to core skills including drawing, visual diary-keeping, research, photography, caseroom and computer skills. Collaborative projects.</p><p>YEAR 3<br />Emphasis on specialist subject development for example illustration (animation, drawing), photography and graphic design (sound, video and moving image). Digital design, national and international competitions, field trips, international exchanges and work placements.</p><p>YEAR 4<br />Self-directed programme. Visits to design studios and <br />industry leaders. Introduction to postgraduate study.</p><h2>CERAMICS PART-TIME</h2><h2>BA (HONS) DESIGN</h2><p>Applicants apply directly to the School</p><p>This is a part-time <br />(50%) programme taught by a combination of on-campus Residential Schools and Distance Learning.</p><p><b>Programme leader</b><br />Archie McCall <br />BA (Hons) Design</p><p>Our part-time programme in Ceramics is designed for those who have previous experience of ceramics and may be working as professional or semi-professional practitioners. It may also be appropriate for those who wish to change career or upgrade their qualifications. A good, working knowledge of ceramic techniques is a prerequisite. </p><p>The programme leads to a Diploma in Higher Education (after two years), BA (after four years) and BA (Hons) (after six years). It is taught by a combination of GSA staff and visiting national and international ceramists.</p><p>The programme consists of practical, technical, theoretical and critical components which are designed develop your knowledge, understanding and skills whilst putting these into the context of contemporary ceramics practice.</p><p>The Studio component is complemented by Historical and Critical Studies delivered by staff from that department.</p><p>Residential Schools are two weeks of highly intensive study. They take place twice per year, at the end of March/April and August/September, and play an important part in the delivery of the programme. Although normally held in Glasgow, one Residential School recently took place at the International Ceramics Studios in Kecskemet, Hungary.</p><p>Project work is completed 'at home' and tutorials are conducted through a Virtual Learning Environment (Blackboard). Home studio requirements include: <br />a potter's wheel; a kiln capable of firing to stoneware temperature; access to a full range of pottery materials; basic plaster-forming facilities; internet access.</p><p>As a student you would form part of a truly international group. Currently we have students from The United Arab Emirates, Malta, France, Germany, Holland, Norway, Iceland and the Republic of Ireland as well those from the UK.</p><h2>PRODUCT DESIGN</h2><h2>BDES/MEDES</h2><p>UCAS INFORMATION<br />Institution Name: <br />GSA<br />Institution Code: <br />G43<br />UCAS Code: <br />HW72<br />Route: <br />A</p><p><b>Programme Leader</b><br />Carlos Peralta  <br />ID, MID (Domus)</p><p>Product Design incorporates new creative knowledge born from an innovative synergy between design and social sciences. </p><p>The programme has departed from traditional product design practice to focus more clearly upon the human and social dimensions of designing. Three main factors underpin this change:</p><ul><li>the integration of social sciences into design projects and in the teaching curriculum</li><li>an extensive student exchange network throughout Europe and beyond</li><li>the encouragement and recognition of languages learning</li></ul><p>These factors, integrated into the design curriculum, differentiate the programme from mainstream Product Design education enabling the programme to create a new breadth of young designers able to professionally operate within a rapidly changing, post industrial and increasingly complex society.</p><p>Programme Structure<br />Students enrol onto a common, core programme in Years 1 and 2 before following one of two distinctive pathways: BDes (Hons) over 4 Years or MEDes over 5 Years in which  Years 3 and 4 are spent studying at two different partner institutions.</p><p>The programme aims to form designers that are well equipped to work in a variety of professional contexts; from industry to design consultancies, from government bodies to community and international organisations in which they will be able to provide a wide range of solutions from objects to services and systems. Our graduate designers would be able to, within these particular contexts, provide design answers to the needs, problems and desires of the individual and society.</p><p>Learning + teaching + assessment <br />Learning and teaching is project based and programme subjects: Design Skills and Context, Historical and Critical studies, Social Sciences and languages are conducted in parallel and are frequently cross-referenced to the design projects. We aim to encourage active participation, dialogue and personal involvement with programme staff, materials <br />and with fellow students. The programmes encourage both, individual and team work and make special emphasis on cross-disciplinary work, mainly with social sciences disciplines.</p><p>The review and assessment of student design work is based on a number of aspects: Research &amp; Investigation, Creative and Imaginative Development and Professional and Executive ability. Within these areas, students' appraisal considers their subject knowledge and understanding, and their development of transferable, cognitive and subject specific skills. Students take an active part in the assessment/review process by filing, comparing and discussing self-review forms with tutors.</p><p>YEARS 1 + 2<br />Development of core design skills creative and imaginative abilities through project work, introduction to communication, computer design tools, project methodology and management strategies, integral language programme, skills and contexts programme.</p><p>YEAR 3 - BDES (HONS) ROUTE<br />Development of practical and conceptual design skills <br />and an appreciation of the designer's role in a cultural and economic context. Integrated social sciences, skills and contexts programme optional overseas academic placement.</p><p>YEAR 3 - MEDES ROUTE<br />Development of practical and conceptual design skills <br />through international exchange Year 1.</p><p>YEAR 4 - BDES (HONS) ROUTE<br />National/international competition project, thematic group project, self directed design project, skills and contexts programme, degree show.</p><p>YEAR 4 - MEDES ROUTE<br />Development of practical and conceptual design skills <br />through International exchange Year 2.</p><p>YEAR 5 - MEDES ROUTE<br />National/international competition project, self directed integrated major dissertation and design project, skills <br />and contexts programme, degree show.</p><h2>PRODUCT DESIGN ENGINEERING</h2><h2>BENG/MENG</h2><p>UCAS INFORMATION<br />Institution Name: <br />GLASG<br />Institution Code: <br />G28<br />UCAS Code: <br />H3W2 (BEng)<br />4 year Programme</p><p>UCAS Code: <br />H3WG (MEng)<br />5 year Programme</p><p>UCAS Code: <br />H3WF (MEng)<br />Accelerated route <br />4 year Programme</p><p>Route: <br />A</p><p><b>Programme Leader</b><br />Professor <br />Alastair S Macdonald  <br />AGSA FRSA ILTM</p><p>21st century society requires innovative products to support changing and increasingly sophisticated human needs and lifestyles. This will be achieved through the ingenuity of confident, high-calibre graduates with the academic skills, creative flair and management ability  to identify opportunities and to create solutions using state-of-the-art product design engineering (PDE) manufacturing processes.  </p><p>The GSA's PDE programme is offered jointly with the University of Glasgow and students enjoy substantial time in each of the two distinctive educational cultures. Students can opt to follow either the BEng or MEng routes, both accredited by the Institution of Mechanical Engineers. </p><p>PDE is particularly suited to those with strong academic skills (particularly Maths and Physics) who wish to apply them in an innovative and creative manner through product design engineering. Fundamentally, we seek individuals with a good imagination, who are conscientious and who have the ability to work hard. If you come with this attitude, we will develop your potential to design. PDE attracts a substantial proportion of women into its programme.</p><p>GSA studio programme is centred around design project activities. This allows synergy between engineering, design and human factors elements of the course, and promotes project-based, student-centred learning. Development of confidence and ability in design skills is an integral component of the programme, therefore a formal art or design portfolio <br />is not essential for entry into year 1.</p><p>Product Design Engineering<br />BEng/Meng</p><p>Learning + teaching + assessment <br />The GSA studio learning and teaching structure follows similar lines to BA (Hons), but without Historical and Critical Studies. This, and the GU lecture and laboratory programme, represent two distinctive elements which are complementary and integrated. Both formative and summative assessments contribute to a student's ability to progress within the <br />programme.</p><p>years 1 + 2<br />GSA studio programme is centred around design project activities. The first two years are designed to develop creativity, exploration and expression of ideas, and to build confidence in the design process. You will be involved in <br />a wide range of activities including design awareness and aesthetics, drawing and visualisation, model-making and prototyping. Skills in communication and project management are also developed.</p><p>At the University of Glasgow, the first two years of the programme contain elements common to the Mechanical Engineering degree and provide the engineering core studies. Subjects studied at GU include applied mathematics, mechanics, thermofluids, materials, electrical and electronic engineering, along with management, economics, and <br />foreign languages.</p><p>Product Design Engineering<br />BEng/Meng</p><p>years 3, 4 + 5<br />Specialist skills are developed in design engineering, the application of engineering theory, and advanced realisation and prototyping tools. Contextual studies relate work to entrepreneurial, economic, business, social and cultural considerations. Industry is introduced through visits and <br />a programme of guest lectures and seminars. The MEng route involves a major project often run in close collaboration with industry or an external client.</p>
