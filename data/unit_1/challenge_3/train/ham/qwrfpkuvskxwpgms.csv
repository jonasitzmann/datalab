		<p>The Digital Design Studio (DDS) is driven by an ethos which ensures that the DDS remains a special place to learn, work and do business. We encourage our students and staff to "think out of the box". By ensuring a true multi disciplinary mix, we actively promote new, visions, perspectives, insights and knowledge. In essence we wish to foster and fuse the creativity of Artists' with the intellectual rigour of Scientists', with education fueling the desire for research and knowledge.</p><p>I hope you enjoy learning more about our courses and research.  We welcome the opportunity of a dialogue, in which we can explore your ideas and interests for our mutual benefit.</p><p>Welcome to the Digital Design Studio at The Glasgow School of Art.</p>
