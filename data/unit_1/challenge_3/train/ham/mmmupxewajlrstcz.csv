	</ul>
	<h3>Undergraduate Courses</h3>
	<p>Undergraduates are the core of our School and our teaching and we offer first degrees that reflect your personal and career goals.  We aim to ensure that you gain an education that will equip you throughout your life with the knowledge and ability to succeed.  Many of our undergraduates join us after gaining Higher National Diplomas (HND) or with wider experience, and our courses reflect that.</p>
	<p>Our undergraduate courses are:</p>
	
	<h1><a name="bio" id="bio" title="Division of Biotechnology and Forensic Sciences anchor"></a>Division of Biotechnology and Forensic Sciences</h1>
	<p>The Division of Biotechnology and Forensic Sciences contains three major research centres at Abertay - <a href="http://www.ace.abertay.ac.uk/">ACE</a> (the Abertay Centre for the Environment), SIMBIOS (a centre for modelling biological systems) and <a href="http://scieng.abertay.ac.uk/siwt/index.htm">SIWT</a> (the Scottish Institute for Wood Technology). Environmental research is a particular strength of the Division of Biotechnology and Forensic Sciences and the division also has strengths in microbiology, ecology and plant biotechnology.  Our courses are innovative and challenging, and draw on our excellent teaching staff, and our close links with industry, to offer qualifications focused on the needs of science in the coming years.</p>

	<a href="../../Courses/CDetails.cfm?RID=4&CID=174&Key=001.002.002" tabindex="13" title="BSc (Hons) Biotechnology">BSc (Hons) Biotechnology</a><br/>
	<p>Biotechnology is one of the success stories of the new millennium and it affects all our lives. As "the appliance of bioscience", biotechnology is helping to diagnose and treat major human diseases, provide new solutions for a cleaner environment, and produce new industrial bioproducts and processes. In Scotland alone, there are now over 250 dedicated biotechnology companies and this sector continues to be at the heart of the Scottish economy.</p>
	<p>As a student on our exciting degree programme you will be stimulated by the emphasis on laboratory work, computer applications and research. On a typical morning you might be analysing DNA on a gel and in the afternoon using a fermenter to produce commercial products. One day learning about how microbes can clean up pollution and on another day visiting a company that researches new anti-cancer drugs. Our students gain a wide range of laboratory-based skills and techniques. These skills plus associated research experience gained in the final year Honours project have enabled our biotechnology graduates to establish an excellent reputation in both industrial and research laboratories.</p>
	
	<a href="../../Courses/CDetails.cfm?RID=4&CID=228&Key=001.002.002" tabindex="15" title="BSc (Hons)  BioMedical Science">BSc (Hons)  BioMedical Science</a><br/>
	<p>This programme is based upon the application of biological sciences and contemporary biology to the solution of medical and medically related industrial, technological and environmental problems. BioMedical Science is a well-founded discipline in which study of the biology of disease, pharmacology, toxicology, medical biochemistry, human biology, physiology, medical microbiology, molecular biology and genetics leads to a deeper understanding of the relationship between humans and the maintenance of their health. This programme has a strong health service and research bias and is aimed at producing the next generation of practical biological scientists in these areas.</p>
	
	<a href="../../Courses/CDetails.cfm?RID=4&CID=207&Key=001.002.002" tabindex="16" title="BSc (Hons) Forensic Sciences">BSc (Hons) Forensic Sciences</a><br/>
	<p>Join the enthralling world of the Forensic Scientist! As crimes become more sophisticated and complex, so do the skills and ingenuity of the Forensic Scientist to help solve them. Forensic Science is the application of scientific knowledge and techniques in support of the legal process. As a Forensic Scientist you are responsible for gathering evidence, the scientific analysis of that evidence, its interpretation and its presentation in a court of law in a form that is impartial, convincing and understandable. The three main areas studied in this course are Forensic Science, Chemistry and Biology with the addition of supporting topics such as Law, Computing and Communication. At Abertay the Forensic Sciences programme covers the full range of topics you would expect; crime scene investigation, weapons, fibres, fingerprints, forgeries, toxicology, drug abuse, photography, poisons, nerve gases, tool marks, impressions and bloodstains. Although criminal law is most closely associated with forensic science our course will also prepare you to interact with the civil law process where there is a growing need for forensic evidence to be presented in a professional and persuasive manner. As our knowledge and understanding of the human genome grows new and fascinating areas of study are opened up to the Forensic Scientist including DNA profiling and the development of DNA databases.</p>
	
	<a href="../../Courses/CDetails.cfm?RID=4&CID=208&Key=001.002.002" tabindex="17" title="DipHE Forensic Studies">DipHE Forensic Studies</a><br/>
	<p>The content of the DipHE Forensic Sciences course shadows the BSc (Hons) Forensic Sciences programme very closely and it is intended that successful DipHE students will join the degree programme. The key difference between this programme and the first two years of the degree programmes is that the DipHE students receive additional, targeted study support in order to prepare them for degree-level studies. The DipHE programme encourages the development of study skills, written, graphical and verbal communication, and the effective use of information technology, in addition to the subject specific studies undertaken. Students choosing not to articulate into the degree programmes may leave with a Diploma in Higher Education.<br/>
	</p>
	<h1><a name="built" id="built" title="Division of the Built and Natural Environment anchor"></a>Division of the Built and Natural Environment</h1>
	<p>The Division of Built and Natural Environment covers the subject areas of civil engineering and environmental management and technology. Our courses are innovative and challenging, and draw on the professional and research expertise of our staff.  The relevance of the courses is ensured by our close links with industry, and the Division's Professional Training Tutor is committed to placing students in relevant paid and supervised work experience during the summer vacations.  The Division includes one of the University's leading research centres, the Urban Water Technology Centre.  UWTC focuses on knowledge transfer and applied research and provides a service to the environment, water and manufacturing industries.  UWTC and the Division have a formidable track record in combining academic skills with commercial expertise in its many projects carried out to date.  The cutting edge knowledge obtained from these activities enhances the resource management and water themes of the undergraduate programmes and 	UWTC operate the Division's Maters Programmes. </p>
	<p>All the courses make extensive use of the Division's well equipped laboratories, which provide practical experience of building science, environmental monitoring, water and environmental engineering, materials, soil mechanics and geology, structural engineering, transportation engineering.  In addition our state of the art surveying equipment, supported by our computer laboratories provide advanced resources for land surveying and modelling, and GIS applications.</p>
	
	<a href="../../Courses/CDetails.cfm?RID=4&CID=182&Key=001.002.002" tabindex="18" title="BSc (Hons) in Civil Engineering">BSc (Hons) in Civil Engineering</a><br/>
	<p>The civil engineer is the professional that provides and maintains the infrastructure that supports our modern industrial society; the roads, bridges, pipelines, and harbours plus the buildings and structures that we inhabit. Our course at Abertay will equip you to start a rewarding long-term career in a well respected and highly valued profession. </p>
	<p>You will find the combination of technical and management studies in the course delivers a dynamic and exciting study programme, with a robust hands-on approach and variety the dominant feature.  On a typical morning you might be using sophisticated electronic surveying equipment to establish the line of a new road and in the afternoon studying management systems associated with construction projects.  One day designing a bridge using specialist software and another using a spread sheet application to calculate the cost of a coffer dam. The course also includes regular site visits and further practical experience is gained through field courses.  Students are encouraged, and assisted, to obtain paid and supervised work experience in the vacations at the end of years two and 3 of the course.</p>
	<p>The course is accredited by the Institution of Civil Engineers as satisfying the academic requirements for progression to Membership of the Institution of Civil Engineers (MICE) and registration with the Engineering Council</p>
	
	<a href="../../Courses/CDetails.cfm?RID=4&CID=176&Key=001.002.002" tabindex="19" title="BSc (Hons) Natural Resources Management">BSc (Hons) Natural Resources Management</a><br/>
	<p>All of our activities influence the health of planet Earth for good or bad. In this course, which is unique in Scotland, you will learn to apply different disciplines to understand how and why we exploit the earth's resources. Everything we consume, apart from air and water, is either mined or grown and hence the management of the world's natural resources is essential for economic and political stability. This is the opportunity for a new generation of graduates with knowledge of contemporary sciences combined with analytical, management and communication skills to challenge existing attitudes to depletion of the earth's resources. Your future could involve evaluating, conserving and managing natural resources at local, national or global levels. You will acquire the knowledge, understanding and skills to help implement radical change based on sound scientific and economic principles. Can you make a difference to the future? There are already many existing career paths associated with these issues and more are developing all the time.<br/>
	</p>
	<h1><a name="health" id="health" title="Division of Health and Food Sciences anchor"></a>Division of Health and Food Sciences</h1>
	<p>Abertay is noted for its significant and continuing contribution to the life sciences. The two Life Sciences Divisions between them are driving forward developments in teaching, research and consultancy in applied aspects of biology, food science, chemistry and the environmental sciences. </p>

	<a href="../../Courses/CDetails.cfm?RID=4&CID=205&Key=001.002.002" tabindex="23" title="BSc (Hons) Food, Nutrition & Health">BSc (Hons) Food, Nutrition & Health</a><br/>
	<p>The ability to make informed choices about what we eat and drink is central to our health and wellbeing. With raised awareness of the relationship between diet, lifestyle choices and health, recent consumer concerns have included food safety, food quality, ethical food production and the importance of access to healthy food choices for all.   As a major contributor to the UK economy, the food and drink sector is a multi-billion pound industry operating in a highly competitive market and must work with the health sector to respond to the challenges of ever-higher consumer expectations. To do so, they need highly qualified graduates with a clear understanding of food, nutrition, health and their inter-relationships.</p>
	<p>We provide this multi-disciplinary approach and the content of first and second year is common to all three courses.. Our food courses are vocationally orientated and we place emphasis on development of practical skills as well as academic learning. Topics include the nature and function of food commodities, recipe analysis, applied nutrition, food presentation techniques, health and lifestyle issues, media and communication skills, health and food safety, food choice, organisational behaviour, marketing and consumer trends.</p>
	
	<a href="../../Courses/CDetails.cfm?RID=4&CID=203&Key=001.002.002" tabindex="24" title="DipHE Food & Consumer Studies">DipHE Food & Consumer Studies</a><br/>
	<p>The content of the DipHE Food & Consumer Studies course shadows the BSc (Hons) Food programmes very closely and successful DipHE students are eligible to join one of these programmes. The key difference between the streams is the additional study support given to DipHE students. The DipHE programme is designed to develop study skills, written, and verbal communication and effective use of information technology. Although students may leave the University with the named award, DipHE Food & Consumer Studies, the purpose of this access route is progression to a degree programme.</p>
<br/>
