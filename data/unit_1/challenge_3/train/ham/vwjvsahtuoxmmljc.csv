<H2>Dobson Room - detailed information about the Liquid Crystal Display
Projector</H2>

<center><img src="d0eqmt72.thm.jpg"></center>

<p>We have an Hitachi model CP-X958W/E LCD projector for displaying
computer output as well as video. The projector is normally stored elsewhere,
so needs to be set up when needed. No computer is provided, so users will need
to bring their own.

<p>The projector is relatively simple to use, and merely plugging in and switching
on generally produces an image provided that the required signal is present on
the VGA input cable. To date most problems have occurred with users never
having used their own computers to drive a separate projector, e.g. not
knowing how to enable the external VGA port, not knowing how to configure the
dual head display found on recent machines, leaving behind the port replicator
which carries the VGA socket on very compact machines.

<p>The following gives detailed instructions:


<p><h3>POSITIONING:</h3>

<p>Normally the best location is on the second row of tables, with the overhead
projector removed. At 5m distance from the screen the image size diagonal can
be adjusted from 2.6m to 3.5m.


<p><h3>POWERING ON:</h3>

<p>The projector can safely be turned on without any drivers attached, the power
switch is on the side and then to switch from standby to "on" use the remote
control or switch on top  - a default screen will be shown. Some menu options
will not work unless a driver (i.e. laptop, video etc.) is attached.


<p><h3>CONTROLS:</h3>

<p>Controls on top of the projector are duplicated on the remote control. The
remote control has the additional potential to control the mouse if the
appropriate connection between laptop and the projector USB port is linked up.


<p><h3>ATTACHING DRIVERS:</h3>

<p>Attach laptop to one of the RGB inputs and boot up. The system must be
configured to detect the projector, which is acting as a second terminal. This
is operating system dependent and appears to be straightforward on newer
machines but may be problematic on older laptops.


<p><h3>ADJUSTING TO FIT THE PROJECTION SCREEN:</h3>

<p>The "zoom" feature (under the sliding cover on the remote control, not to be
confused with "magnify") can adjust the overall size in the range described
above. To apply keystone correction to get a rectangular image use the "menu"
button. Use the arrow keys on the projector or the appropriate edge of the pad
on the remote control to move between items on the menu. Move to the image
menu, down to the keystone item and then shift left or right to increase or
decrease the adjustment. Press "reset" to return to default, or "menu" to
close the menu. (The menu options are only available when there is some input
device attached).


<p><h3>MAGNIFY OPTION:</h3>
 
<p>The magnify option on the remote control allows you to zoom in on a particular
part of the display. To move the displayed area press "position" and then use
the pad. "off" returns to the unmagnified display.


<p><h3>SWITCHING OFF:</h3>

<p>Put into standby mode, shutdown and disconnect laptop, turn power off, replace
lens cap.


<p><h3>SHOWING VIDEOS FROM THE VIDEO PLAYER:</h3>

<p>This is only worthwhile if the TV displays are inadequate because of the
setting-up time. An SVHS cable is available, and should be plugged into the
video player outlet, and the LCD projector S-Video In socket. The projector
should automatically switch to this input. If either or both of the RGB
sockets is/are connected as well, then you may need to select video using the
INPUT button on the keypad. The projector functions with PAL, NTSC and SECAM,
although the video player is believed to be limited to PAL and NTSC.
