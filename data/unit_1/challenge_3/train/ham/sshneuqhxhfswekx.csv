<h1>THE GLASGOW SCHOOL OF ART - A HOTHOUSE OF CREATIVITY</h1><p>Founded in 1845 as one of the first Government Schools of Design, The Glasgow School of Art has grown to become one of the UK's pre-eminent institutions for the study and advancement of fine art, design and architecture.</p><p>Located in the centre of Glasgow, Scotland's largest city, the GSA is one of the few remaining independent art schools in the UK.  We have an internationally community of over 1600, primarily undergraduate students, studying in 10 specialist fine art or design departments, or within the respected Mackintosh School of Architecture. </p><p>Our postgraduate population at master's level is focused on the internationally renowned multidisciplinary Master of Fine Art, the internationally renowned Digital Design Studio - a specialist research centre in 2D/3D motion graphics and the Masters of Design Practice - Textiles as Fashion.</p><p>Our postgraduate population is projected to grow to 25% of our total student community by 2010 with the introduction of new Master's courses and an increase in PhD students allied to specialist research centres.</p><p>For many people the GSA is about the drive and standing of our academic staff, past and present, who create the energetic and dynamic environment in which new ideas can flourish.  Academic staff such as Professor Paul Anderson, Director of the Digital Design Studio, undertaking work with Ford (USA) and QinetiQ, Professor Thomas Joshua Cooper, internationally renowned fine art photographer, who's work was recently selected to hang in the new Scottish Parliament Building, Jack Cunningham, jeweller, who has recently curated an exhibition of contemporary narrative European jewellery involving over 70 key jewellers from 20 European countries and Sally Stewart, architecture, working in the areas of accessible design and design for the elderly.</p><p>For many, the name of the GSA is synonymous with Charles Rennie Mackintosh, one of the most influential artist, designer, architects of the late 19th and early 20th century.  An alumnus of the School and architect of our main building, Mackintosh is one of a stream of intensely creative and innovative graduates, generations of successful and distinguished artists, designers and architects who have influenced and continue to influence world culture, creativity and design.</p><p>Today GSA graduates can be found worldwide, working for companies such as IBM, Apple, Dyson, Jaguar Cars, the Ford Motor Company, Foster Associates, Richard Rogers Architects, Nokia and Erricsson.  Others have joined the international design houses of Armani, Versace, Donna Karen and a large number a forging a name for themselves as today's creative industry entrepreneurs.  </p><p>Many choose to continue as practicing artists, adding to the growing list of GSA alumni who are making a major contribution to the world of contemporary fine art, winning international acclaim. </p><p>Our graduates include the new Glasgow Boys and Girls of the 1980s - Peter Howson, Ken Currie, Steven Campbell, Adrian Wiszniewski, Alison Watt, short listed for the Jerwood Painting Prize, Christine Borland and Jim Lambie - Turner Prize nominees, Jenny Saville, Turner Prizewinners Douglas Gordon and Simon Starling and Beck's Futures Winners (2000, 2002, 2003) Roderick Buchanan, Toby Paterson and Rosalind Nashashibi.</p><p>The GSA's position as Scotland's leading art school is reflected in the success of our graduates at a national level.  At the Venice Biennale 2007 five of the six artists chosen to represent Scotland were GSA graduates and 2005, all the artists chosen to represent Scotland were graduates of the GSA.  At the Biennale in 2003, 70% of the artists selected to represent Scotland were GSA including Claire Barclay, Simon Startling and Jim Lambie.  At the Milan International Design Fair in 2004, the worlds leading design fair, 60% of the designers chosen to represent Scotland were GSA graduates including Timorous Beasties, 6am Hoover and Slight; and Charlie Sutherland and Charlie Hussey, GSA graduates and tutors in the Mackintosh School of Architecture, won the RIAS Best Building in Scotland Award in 2003 for their Ferry Shelter in Tiree.</p>
