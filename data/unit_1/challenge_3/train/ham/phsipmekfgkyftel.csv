<p>Welcome to the Mackintosh School of Architecture, an international school rooted in Glasgow - Britain's only true Victorian gridiron city with 19th century buildings to rival Chicago.</p><p>Architecture has been taught at the GSA from the middle of the 19th century and the School boasts Charles Rennie Mackintosh and two of Glasgow's most notable modern architects, Andy MacMillan and Isi Metzstein of the postwar architectural practice Gillespie Kidd and Coia, amongst its most eminent alumni.  In a recent survey by the Architects' Journal (2006) the Mac was ranked by the profession as the best architecture school in Scotland and third in the UK.</p><p>Our approach to research and teaching is fundamentally simple - we care about how buildings and places are made and used and this deep concern is reflected in the design reputation of the School - for aesthetically and intellectually rigorous architecture set in a social and urban context.</p><p>At the Mackintosh School of Architecture, the emphasis is on student-centred active learning, which means being involved in a wide range of experiences and exercises. Students are encouraged to develop their own direction and solutions, imaginatively and creatively, through set studio design projects, supported by full-time studio tutors and leading practitioners.</p><p>Many schools of architecture claim to balance art with science - we do this by being part of a creative hothouse of artists, designers and architects that comprise the GSA. </p>
			<li>Architecture has been a part of the teaching at the GSA from the middle of the 19th century with the first professor of architecture Eugene Bourdon.  Trained at the Ecole des Beaux-Arts in Paris. Bourdons impact on Glasgow can be seen in the work of his pupils, the best of whom were sent to work in New York architectural offices.</li>
