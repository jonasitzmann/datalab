<P>Using this page you can search for places (settlements, features, attractions
or people) by stored statistics. You can select from a list of database
statistics and optionally enter a range of values (sensible values will be
provided if you don't enter anything). Each feature may include one or more
statistics. You can, for example, list all of the highest mountains, deepest
lochs or longest rivers in Scotland using this option. The population figures are from the 1991
Census. The values are always listed from the largest in descending order. 
<p>
Use the detailed instructions on the 'statistics' page to guide you through the
search procedure.
<P>
For settlements, features and attractions you can search either all of Scotland
or just one council area.  For searches involving famous people this option is
ignored by the system.  This is because famous people are less often associated
with a modern council area.  They are much more likely to be associated
with individual settlements or features.
<p>


   <HR SIZE="3" NOSHADE="noshade"><H4><A NAME="Overview">Council Area</A></H4>

   Since 1995, Scotland is divided into 32 local government divisions called 
   <i>Council Areas</i>.  In the Gazetteer for Scotland, we have used these
   contemporary geographical units as the principal division for settlements,
   features and attractions.  An entry has been written for each council area,
   which encompasses its character, geography, history and industry. Of the
   thirty-two, there are three island authorities (Orkney, Shetland and the
   Western Isles) and four city authorities (Aberdeen, Dundee, Edinburgh and
   Glasgow).  Each of these cities will have a 
'<A HREF="#TOverview">settlement</a>' entry in addition
   to the 'council area' entry. The former tend to be more specific and cover
   only the city itself and not surrounding settlements or districts which 
   might be included in the council area. A further important distinction between
   the 'council area' and 'settlement' entries for these four cities is that
   the '<A NAME="CMoreDetails">More Details</a>' 
<A href="#Tabs">tab</a> for council areas only gives information about
   other entities which must be contained within that particular council area.
   In contrast, settlement entries may include links to any other entity where
   some valid connection exists (eg. proximity, a mention in the text etc.).


   <H4><B>Overview</B></H4>
   <P>This page gives a brief overview of the Council Area, together with a

   <HR SIZE="3" NOSHADE="noshade"><H4><A NAME="TOverview">Settlements</a></H4>

   Settlements vary in size and composition from large cities, such as Glasgow,
   through to tiny hamlets which perhaps include only a few scattered houses.
   Note that for each of the four main Scottish cities, which are also 
   Council Areas, there are two gazetteer entries;
namely a 'settlement' entry and a '<a href="#Overview">council area</a>' entry. 
The former tend to be more specific and cover
   only the city itself and not surrounding settlements or districts which
   might be included in the council area.  A further important distinction
between
   the 'council area' and 'settlement' entries for these four cities is that
   the 'further details' tab for council areas only gives information about
   other entities which must be contained within that particular council area.
   In contrast, settlement entries may include links to any other entity where
   some valid connection exists (eg. proximity, a mention in the text etc.).

   <H4><B>Overview</B></H4>

<P>This page show you several additional pieces of information for the
Settlement.  First it provides a classification of the 'Settlement Type', 
primarily based on population, as follows:

<ul>
<li>City - the largest settlement, cities are legally-defined entities
<li>Town - a settlement with a population of more than 20,000 persons which is
not a city
<li>Small town - a settlement with a population between 6,000 - 20,000
<li>Village - a settlement with a population with up to 6,000 persons
<li>Hamlet - a small nucleated settlement without a defined population
(probably less than 50)
<li>Settlement - a very small, perhaps ill-defined settlement 
<li>Locality - a scattered collection of features, including some form of 
settlement, which share a name
<li>Suburb - part of a city or town, which grew from a distinctly separate
settlement ('new' suburbs are defined as geographical-features (above) of type
'urban district'
</ul>

This is followed by the population of the settlement from the 1991
Census. Below this any additional information on the Geography,
History and Industry for the Settlement is displayed.</P>

<P>This is followed by a list of publications for further reading.  Finally, at
the bottom of the page, you can see a list of all the related Features,
Families, Famous People and Attractions for this Settlement.  You can use this
list to move to any of the Places or People shown by simply clicking on the
name.</P>

   <HR SIZE=1 NOSHADE="noshade"><H4><A NAME="THistorical"><B>Historical Information</B></A></H4>
   <p>This page includes a historical perspective on the settlement, drawn from

   <HR SIZE=1 NOSHADE="noshade"><H4><A NAME="Latlon"><B>Latitude and Longitude</B></A></H4>

   Latitude and Longitude are an internationally-used method of locating
   places and positions on the surface of the earth.  This is one of two
   methods we use in the Gazetteer for Scotland to give you a location, the
   other being the <A HREF="#NGrid">British National Grid</a>. Latitude and
   Longitude have the advantage of being used in most atlases, although often
   the scale of the maps you will find there is not sufficiently detailed to
   prove useful within a small country like Scotland.
   <p>
   Latitude expresses the distance North or South of the equator, whereas
   longitude expresses the distance East or West of an arbitrary line drawn
   through Greenwich (near London). We have adopted the convention of giving
   these values as 'decimal degrees', for example:
   <blockquote>
           56.45&deg; N  or 3.25&deg; W
   </blockquote>
   <p>
   Latitude and longitude values displayed in the Gazetteer for Scotland may
   not be completely exact although we try to maintain an accuracy of better 
   than +/- 200m.  This is because latitute and longitude values are
   automatically calculated from British National Grid references, which 
   themselves are stored to an accuracy of 100m. 

   <HR SIZE=1 NOSHADE="noshade"><H4><A NAME="NGrid"><B>The National Grid</B></A></H4>

   The National Grid is the primary map referencing system used in Great
   Britain (ie. including Scotland, but excluding Northern Ireland, which uses
   an Irish Grid).  It was developed by the Ordnance Survey, Britain's 
   National Mapping Agency to allow places to be located on their mapping.
   <p>
   The Gazetteer for Scotland provides a <b>National Grid Reference</b> to
   tell you where places are, and allow them to be located on British maps,
   particularly the Ordnance Survey Landranger Series.
   <p>
   The National Grid divides the country up into 100km grid squares and
   assigns each a two-letter prefix (eg. the NT square includes Edinburgh).
   Numbers are then added to give an exact location. Usually six numbers are
   used, giving a location down to 100m on the ground. The first three numbers
   give the East-West location (the 'x' dimension or easting) and the last
   three numbers give the North-South location (the 'y' dimension or northing).
   <p>
   Thus the National Grid Reference for Edinburgh Castle is:
   <blockquote>
   <a href="http://www.streetmap.co.uk/newsearch.srf?X=325150&Y=673550&z=3&ar=Y&dn=526">
   NT 251 735</a>
   </blockquote>
   <p>This means that it is in the 100km square 'NT' and is 25.1km east 
   and 73.7km north from the bottom-left corner of that square. You can click
   on the above reference to see the location on a example of an Ordnance
   Survey Landranger map (thanks to streetmap.co.uk)
   <p>
   The grid is overprinted on all Landranger maps as 1km squares to allow easy
   location of places. Further information is available on the Ordnance Survey Web Site,
