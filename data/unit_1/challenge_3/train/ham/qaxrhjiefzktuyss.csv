<p>The School of Fine Art at the GSA, is a hive of creative activity where students and staff encourage a wide range of art related activities within an atmosphere of trust and support that allows the development of artistic identities with a critical sense that fosters innovation and critical thinking.</p><p>Within Fine Art, students are encouraged to formulate an individual vision of the world, whether intuitive or historical and theoretically conscious and through a common visual language share this with others.  It is an imaginative exploration and mediation of creative ideas and concepts, resolved in the production of contemporary art.</p><p>We have three strong departments, each with the ambition to develop a room in the grand "House of the Art" and within the departments of Painting & Printmaking, Photography and Sculpture & Environmental Art, you will find an international community of emergent artists, working with and supported by staff and tutors who are artists as well as academics.  </p><p>Fine Art at Glasgow is flexible and alert to the changes in our social, economical and cultural surrounding and the intertwined relationship between learning, teaching, practice and research is constantly scrutinised, reflected and enhanced to release its inert power.  The result is a School that is creative, dynamic, relevant and definitely not standing still - welcome to the School of Fine Art. </p>
