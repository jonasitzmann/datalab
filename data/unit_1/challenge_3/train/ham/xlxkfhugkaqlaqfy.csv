The Society has extensive photographic collections, comprising mainly 35mm mounted slides, but also including an important collection of over 8,000 lantern slides, and a smaller collection of prints and negatives.
<p align=justify>
The <b>35mm slides</b> are not yet catalogued, although some parts of the collection are stored in subject or geographical area order, which makes a limited degree of logical retrieval possible. &nbsp; Major donations incorporated in the collection include those of Professor Terry Coppock (Ogilvie Professor of Geography at the University of Edinburgh), Glasgow University Geography Department, and Isobel Wylie Hutchison.
</p>
<p align=justify>
The <b>lantern slides</b> incorporate the collections of various organisations such as the Scottish Oceanographical Institute, Glasgow University Geography Department, and Marlborough College. &nbsp; The important personal collections of individuals such as Dr. D.A. Allan, Dr. William Bruce, W.G. Burn-Murdoch, Ella Christie, Isobel Wylie Hutchison, and G.W. Wight (among others) have also greatly enriched the Society's collections. &nbsp; These slides have recently been the subject of several special projects, such as one supported by <a href="http://www.scran.ac.uk/">SCRAN</a> (Scottish Cultural Resources Access Network), and another under the auspices of the <a href="http://gdl.cdlr.strath.ac.uk/">Glasgow Digital Library</a>, both of which have greatly improved the access to this nationally-important body of material. &nbsp; It is hoped in due course to make a further selection of scanned images available on our own web-pages.
</p>
<p align=justify>
The <b>prints</b> consist mainly of a working collection used as source material for illustrations in RSGS publications, and as a photographic record of Society activities, but also include a collection of historic photographs of past officers of the Society. &nbsp; Some examples of the latter category have been framed, and now decorate the walls of the headquarters.
</p>
<p align=justify>
A substantial number of glass and film <b>negatives</b> is to be found in the collection, but these are mostly as yet uncatalogued.
</p>
<p align=justify>
A few 35mm <b>film-strips</b> and 16mm and 8mm motion <b>films</b> are also included in our holdings.

Items from these collections may be inspected by prior arrangement with the <a href="http://personal.strath.ac.uk/kerr.jamieson/">Curator</a>, but potential clients should bear in mind that our viewing facilities are limited, especially in the case of lantern slides and motion films. &nbsp; It may be possible in some instances for reproductions (within the terms of the current copyright legislation) to be made at the client's expense, and details of <a href="collecti.htm#Charges">charges</a> for this service can be found on our general <a href="collecti.htm">Research Collections</a> page. &nbsp; Some paper-copy reproduction can be undertaken in-house, but for other formats it will be necessary to enlist the services of a professional photographer. &nbsp; Only in exceptional circumstances may any items be borrowed, entirely at the discretion of the <a href="OfficeBe/director.htm">Director</a>.
