Welcome to the IWGPVFV Home Page!
<H3>About the IWGPVFV</H3>
The IWGPVFV exists to encourage research, contacts and communication amongst anyone who is interested in plant viruses transmitted by fungi and/or the fungal vectors. Members of the group have a wide range of research interests, covering both applied and fundamental studies. This includes control of viruses and vectors, epidemiology, biology and taxonomy of the vectors (<I>Olpidium, Polymyxa, Spongospora</I> spp.) and the molecular biology of the viruses.<P>
The IWGPVFV was officially launched at the 5th International Congress of Plant Pathology in Kyoto, Japan, in 1988 following an initiative by Professor C Hiruki. The group produces a <A HREF = "register.html">Register of Research Interests</A> and organises workshops at intervals of approximately 3 years. Membership is free of charge and open to all who are actively engaged in any aspect of  research work on these viruses or their fungal vectors.
