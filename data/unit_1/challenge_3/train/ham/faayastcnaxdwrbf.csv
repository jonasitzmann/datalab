<strong>ARDEN SHAKESPEARE SITE (ArdenNet)</strong><br>
With the 3rd series of editions in progress and an excellent CD-ROM, the
people at Arden Shakespeare are striving to monopolise academic
Shakespeare. The Internet's possibilities could one day make a bit of a
mockery of print dominance, so they've made a bold attempt to get into the
action in this arena as well.
<p>
Head for the Arden Shakespeare website at: <a href=http://www.ardenshakespeare.com/main/welcome.html>http://www.ardenshakespeare.com/main/welcome.html</a>.
<p>
There's a lot here - or rather, there's a framework for a lot here. This
site depends on enthusiastic input from an imagined constituency of
electronic scholars. The fact that this constituency has not been proved to
exist anywhere else yet (although the FICINO list and its kind come close)
is the problem: and the question facing us is, as CERES has trumpeted
before, whether to be part of the problem, or part of the solution.
<p>
To get started you'll need to surrender some not very intimate information
and think up a password. By the way, some would say that it would be a good
idea not to use the same password for everything.
<p>
The site is organised under headings which cover a wide range of content.
You should know that the following chirpy-sounding list mainly uses the
ArdenNet's own wording:
<dl>
<dt><strong>Professional</strong></dt>
<dd>This section provides those involved in Shakespeare studies with the
everyday information they need in their work. Currently, it provides: a
listing of Shakespeare organisations; a calendar of Shakespeare
conferences; the opportunity for institutions to post employment vacancies
in the Shakespearean world.</dd>
<dt><strong>Internet</strong></dt>
<dd>This section groups together those essays and resources in ArdenNet which
relate to the wider Internet. Currently available are a review of sites
useful for Shakespeare research on the Internet by Gabriel Egan, and all
the links from this and other articles in ArdenNet.</dd>
<dt><strong>Scholarship</strong></dt>
<dd>The Scholarship section is the heart of ArdenNet - and members are invited
to participate. Its purpose is to exploit the potential of the World Wide
Web by providing a space for shorter pieces, 'work in progress' towards
academic papers, articles or books, or for discussion papers, ideas and
thoughts which are either too short or inappropriate for publication via
the currently available channels. Already available are an essay on
Shakespeare in the Electronic Age by Peter S. Donaldson and the transcript
of an interview with the RSC actor John Voss.</dd>
<dt><strong>News & Reviews</strong></dt>
<dd>The News and Reviews section is where to go for listings and comment about
Shakespeare books, multimedia and performances (on both stage and screen).
Highlights include theatre listings and reviews, and 'my favourite book'
and 'my favourite performance' selections from ArdenNet members. 'My
favourite' selections available include an account of Shakespeare on stage
in Nigeria from Martin Banham and Olwen Terris' account of an influential
set of Rossiter lectures in print.</dd>
<dt><strong>Teaching</strong></dt>
<dd>This area of ArdenNet is devoted to the discussion of teaching Shakespeare
- from high school to postgraduate level. It is intended to be an organic
resource which grows as ArdenNet members contribute their own thoughts and
experiences as short articles or multimedia pieces. Currently available are
essays from David Scott Kastan (on teaching textual Shakespeare) and
Rebecca Bushnell (on teaching Shakespeare using the Internet).</dd>
<dt><strong>Discussion</strong></dt>
<dd>Join the debates... ArdenNet invites members to join the community's
discussions of the issues raised by its resources.</dd>
</dl>
<p>
CERES offers its two-penn'orth: as was hinted above, it's easy to summarise
the state of play: the system is there, and the space available, to create
a really substantial forum for electronic discussion. Whether we are yet at
the technological watershed which will suddenly make this work well is
unclear. Hope springs eternal, and Arden has many influential friends, so
keep an eye on ArdenNet.

<strong>CULTURAL READINGS: COLONIZATION AND PRINT IN THE AMERICAS<br>
NEW ON LINE EXHIBITION</strong><br>
This collaborative web site presents and interprets a wide variety of texts
- books, manuscripts, illustrations, maps, and artifacts - generated by
Europe's colonization of the Americas. Comparative and broad in scope, the
exhibition investigates Spanish, French, English, and Dutch 'readings' of
the New World and the 'readings' of Europeans made by many Native cultures.
Topics covered include the literature of colonial promotion; printed images
of Natives; Native responses to print; missionary activities; Indian
languages; the geographies of the New World; and captivity narratives. The
web site also contains essays by Louise Burkhart, Sabine MacCormack,
Michael Ryan, Daniel Slive, and Karim Tiro; bibliography; and web links.
Materials shown in 'Cultural Readings' are drawn from the collections of
the Jay I. Kislak Foundation; the Rosenbach Museum & Library; the
University of Pennsylvania's Department of Special Collections; and the
University of Pennsylvania Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology. Find it at <a href=http://www.library.upenn.edu/special/gallery/kislak/index/cultural.html>http://www.library.upenn.edu/special/gallery/kislak/index/cultural.html</a>.

<strong>THE ARTIST IN AN AGE OF IMPERIAL CULTURE:<br>
CAREERS IN THE EARLY MODERN PERIOD</strong><br>
June 1-24, 1998, University Park, Pennsylvania. 'The Artist in an Age of Imperial Culture: Careers in the Early Modern Period' will offer an introduction to this neglected topic in English and European humanities curricula, focusing primarily on literary careers and secondarily on the careers of visual artists. By highlighting the figure of the artist shaping a career amid the constraints of imperial culture, the
institute will form the first attempt to establish a baseline on which
future work may proceed.
<p>
The institute will be open to fifteen qualified participants. Each
participant must be either a faculty member at an accredited college or
university, or a graduate student from an accredited college or university
attending the institute with a faculty mentor. All participants must hold
at least a master of arts degree or its equivalent.
<p>
The institute seeks to attract a wide audience, including (1) teachers and
scholars of the early modern period who want to learn of current trends and
research possibilities in this area; (2) specialists in classics, art
history, history, Italian, French, Spanish, and English, as well as other
languages, who wish to study texts from their respective disciplines and
who then wish to broaden their study through a comparative and
interdisciplinary framework; (3) teachers of the humanities who wish to
incorporate the topic of English and European careers in their courses; (4)
teachers in other periods-such as medieval or eighteenth-century-who wish
to understand the historical tradition that the institute will examine. For
complete details and up-to-date information, please visit the web site:

<strong>THE URBAN ROGUE IN 17TH CENTURY LONDON</strong><br>
CFP for a session at the Central New York Conference on Language and
Literature, SUNY Cortland, Cortland, NY October 18-20, 1998. As London grew
from a medieval village to a seventeenth-century metropolis, the urban
rogue and trickster, sometimes a con man, sometimes a thief, sometimes a
self-portrait of a writer, became increasingly important to English
literature.  This panel focuses on how different literary versions of the
urban rogue reflect changes in the culture of early modern England.  Papers
considering the transmission of the Spanish picaro into English letters are
also welcome.  Send 250-word abstracts by June 15.
