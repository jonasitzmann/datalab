		<h2>UNDERGRADUATE STUDY AT THE GSA</h2><p>At the GSA we give you freedom and independence within an intellectually challenging and stimulating environment, to explore ideas and realise your potential.</p><p>We offer a practice-led, project driven, studio-based learning experience that will challenge your creative powers, develop your talents, and ultimately give your work a professional edge - a highly charged creative environment which will impact on your work.</p><p>Join us for a journey that will take you on a learning experience that will last you a lifetime. </p><h2>MACKINTOSH SCHOOL OF ARCHITECTURE</h2><p>Architecture is an art form that everyone participates in. We see it and we touch it. It inspires and provokes. And it transforms lives and communities. Architecture is a truly democratic art - and that's why it's so vital to our future.</p><p>The Mackintosh School of Architecture has always been a proving ground for progressive thought. Part of the learning experience at the GSA since the middle of the 19th century, the 'Mac' has a reputation for aesthetically and intellectually rigourous architecture, set in an urban and social context. </p><p>The city itself provides a powerful stimulus for study. From its legacy as Britain's only true Victorian gridiron city and its subsequent economic decline, to its transformation as a pioneering post-industrial city, there could hardly be a more stimulating environment in which to study architecture.  </p><p>Our ever-growing network of leading international visiting professors, lecturers and guest teachers, provides a vibrant complement to our academic staff, many of whom are practising architects, such as the Stirling prize-shortlisted Charlie Sutherland and Charlie Hussey. <br />Our visiting professors include Dickon Robinson of the Peabody Trust, an expert in urban regeneration, and C J Lim of Studio 8 Architects in London. </p><p>Glasgow is a city located geographically and historically between the cities of northern Europe and those of the new world. This internationalism has always influenced our students, our essentially urban setting sparking new thoughts on the city and the role that architecture can play to enhance our daily lives. </p><p>To study architecture at the GSA is to study life itself. We invite you to live yours to the full.</p><p>Professor David Porter <br />BSc (Hons) DipArch FRIAS RIBA <br />Head of Mackintosh School of Architecture</p><h2>HONORARY PROFESSORS</h2><p>Professor John Gibbons <br />Chief Architect Scottish Executive, Edinburgh <br />Professor C J Lim <br />Studio 8 Architects, London Director, Bartlett Architecture Lab, University <br />College, London <br />Professor Dickon Robinson<br />Peabody Trust, London <br />Professor Wim Van Den Bergh<br />Architect, Maastricht, The Netherlands Professor Of Housing, RWTH Aachen, Germany <br />Professor Dean Hawkes<br />Leverhulme Emeritus Research Fellow </p><h2>EMERITUS PROFESSOR</h2><p>Professor Andy Macmillan, OBE</p><h2>SENIOR RESEARCH FELLOW</h2><p>Professor Colin Porteous </p><ul><li><b>Living and learning in Glasgow provides an intoxicating blend of academic and practical understanding. </b>Siddarth Money MArch</li></ul><h2>TEACHING + LEARNING + ASSESSMENT</h2><p>At the Mackintosh School of Architecture the emphasis is on student-centred active learning, which means involving students in a wide range or learning experiences and exercises, where the individual is encouraged to develop their own direction and solutions.</p><p>The programmes of studies (BArch and DipArch) are organised over five years, delivered through two academic programmes. The syllabus includes design, construction, structures, environmental science, history, sociology, economics, law and management, as well as skills in hand drawing, computer-aided drawing, three-dimensional visualisation, model-making and workshop techniques, photography, audiovisual and verbal presentation, and core skills including problem solving and working with other people. </p><p>The study of Architecture at the MSA is wide ranging to develop students to have the aptitude, enthusiasm and commitment for the demands of professional practice in the contemporary world. </p><p>In addition to studio-based work, there are lectures, seminars and practical courses taught by both full-time and visiting lecturers. The School attracts the foremost international architects and designers. Students may also become involved in live projects, field study visits, research and competitions. Recent study visits include Amsterdam, Barcelona, Berlin, Paris and New York. </p><p>We have an international group of guest teachers who contribute to the programmes. This group has recently included Simon Allford of AHMM in London; Jan Peter Wingender, Head of Architecture at the Amsterdam Academy; Rachel Chidlow of UCD, Dublin; Yushi Uehara from Amsterdam; Sarah Hare of Hare Architects, London; Richard Lavington of MacCreanor Lavington London/Rotterdam; Walter Unterrainer from the Fachhochule Liechtenstein; Chris Thurlbourne and Steven Willacy of the Architecture School of Aarhus, Denmark and Jane Wernick of Wernick Associates. </p><p>Recent visiting lecturers have included Benedette Taigilabue of EMBT architects, Barcelona; Lord Richard Rogers; David Chipperfield; Peter St John of Caruso St John; Jon Rouse of CABE; Gordon Benson of Benson Forsyth; Jonathan Sergison of Sergison Bates; Peter Ahrends of ABK; Ricardo Flores &amp; Eva Prats, Barcelona; Steve Marshall of Munkenbeck and Marshall; Max Fordham; Peter Blundell Jones and Caroline Bos of UN Studio. </p><ul><li>The School is based in the Bourdon Building, facilities include a high-specification super-computer suite and a HyDRA video conferencing system that links the Mac to the Digital Design Studio.</li></ul><h2>CAREERS + ALUMNI</h2><p>Architecture is the most visible of all forms.

Students undertaking this mode of study must be employed in an approved architects office. </p><p>Applications for the DipArch should be made directly to the School. For information on Master of Architecture by Conversion, see page 127.</p><h2>MASTER OF ARCHITECTURE BY CONVERSION</h2><h2>MARCH</h2><p>Students who achieve a sufficiently high standard in the final design thesis of the Diploma course may be eligible to proceed to a programme leading to the award of a Masters degree, MArch (by Conversion), where there is an opportunity to develop an aspect of the thesis design in greater depth. Students progressing on to the MArch (by Conversion) prepare a special piece of work relating to their final design thesis supervised by the Professor of Architecture.</p><p>The MArch (by Conversion) programme takes a further term of full-time study or by agreement with the Head of School, three terms part-time. During this time, students develop ideas stemming from their previous years work, which are <br />of particular interest to them. They develop fluency in the discussion of contemporary issues, which encourages them to place their own work in the wider context of present day architecture and society.</p><p>The exhibition at the end of the course is seen as a valuable demonstration of the highest level of student aspiration and achievement and an important teaching tool for the School. Students are encouraged to devise and organize a public exhibition of their work - in 2002 at Glasgow's Centre for Contemporary Art and in 2003 at the Fruitmarket Gallery in the Merchant City area of Glasgow.</p>
