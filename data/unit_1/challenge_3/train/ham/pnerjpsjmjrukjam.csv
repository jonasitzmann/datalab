Welcome to the Training Planner, which draws together all in-house training available to teaching and support staff in Brighton & Hove's schools.
<p></p>
This information complements the Children, Families and Schoolsâ training and development course information Brochure already 
in schools (sent via your staff development co-ordinator).
<p></p>
This site enables you to search by date course title and provider. There are three providers the main one being the School 
Adviser/Consultant team who deliver the vast majority of training development for school staff including Teaching Assistants 
and support staff. Additionally ICT and Governors provide training which is relevant to school based staff.
<p></p>
<strong>Applications</strong> for courses should be made on Application Form TR/5 (a hard copy is available in the school 
Training & Development Brochure or you can save the form electronically from this site) quoting the course code and title and 
then sent via post fax or e-mailed to the relevant team as found on the course flyer. Donât forget you need authorisation from 
your Headteacher before you send your application. If sending via e-mail please confirm, you have your headteachers permission 
to attend. The closing date* for applications is <strong>three weeks (15 working days)</strong> prior to the course start date.
<p></p>
<strong>Cancellations</strong> made prior to the closing date* incur no charges â however once we are committed to running 
a course we incur costs. Therefore all cancellations made after the closing date and / or non-attendance will be charged 
either the full course fee or an administration charge of Â£15.00 (to cover lunch and administration costs for courses that 
are centrally funded). Schools are welcome to allocate a booking to another staff member. If you do, please ensure that we 
are informed immediately.

<p></p>
In addition to the Training Planner, the corporate Learning & Development Team produce Learning & Development 
Guides for staff in Children, Families and Schools and all council staff.  Some courses within these guides may 
be appropriate for school staff, eg. food hygiene, manual handling, first-aid, skills for life, equalities, 
health & safety, ICT (general software), management skills and other general skills such as assertiveness, 
communication and touch-typing.  Click on the links below to access the guides:

Following your schoolâs performance management cycle, if you have any requests/suggestions for staff development 
which we don't currently offer, please complete the attached form and return to the Schools' Training Team 
(contact details attached).  All requests will be considered and, where possible, identified needs will be met.
