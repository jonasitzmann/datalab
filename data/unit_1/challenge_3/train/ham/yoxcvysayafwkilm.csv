<h2 align=center>Online Texts</h2>
<p>
<strong>OCTAVO</strong><br>
<cite>A few words from our top Gizmo Correspondent, Colin Burrow</cite>
<p>
The American publishers Octavo have begun a series of electronic
reproductions of early modern books, which combine the pleasures and detail
of a photographic facsimile with the convenience - say it, pastability - of
e-texts. So far they offer Hooke's <cite>Micrographia</cite>, Newton's <cite>Opticks</cite>,
Shakespeare's <cite>Poems (1640)</cite>, with a variety of goodies planned for future
publication, including Johnson's <cite>Dictionary</cite>, Harvey on the circulation of
the blood and Vesalius's <cite>De Humani Corporis Fabrica</cite>. The focus is on texts with a large visual component, but they are also promising some more texty
texts such as <cite>Areopagitica</cite> in the near future.
<p>
What do you get? Well, the great thing about the series is that the texts
come as PDF files which can be viewed with an Adobe Acrobat viewer. This is
free, small, quite fast, and many people will have it anyway installed on
their systems. It enables you to view the volumes in near-photographic
quality (you can see things like show through from the previous page,
splodges of ink, torn corners, even the indentations made by individual
pieces of type -- although real bibliographers might grouse at the lack of
good shots of watermarks). You can also zoom in, scroll down, and navigate
through the volume by means of hyperlinks. Rudimentary keyword searches are
possible as well as more sophisticated proximity searches. And you can
paste text from what appears to be a photograph into a word-processor.
Pages can be viewed in three levels of detail: Print (which is black and
white and works fast), Browse (which is in decent colour, but which
disables text copying), Read (which is in good colour quality and which
enables copying text) and Examine (which is extremely high detail, with
pixels only becoming visible at 800x magnification). Examine mode is
slowish on a Pentium 166, but Read mode lets you, well, read. And Octavo
have cleverly made it look as though you are turning the pages as you move
through the volume.
<p>
The limitations are mostly those of the Adobe Acrobat Viewer. Copying text
works quite well, except that if you copy the bottom half of one page on an
opening you also as far as I could tell have to copy the text at the bottom
of the facing page. Sometimes text pasted from the 1640 Shakespeare's poems
lost its line-endings. But one can live with this once one knows it's a
problem. There are nice touches: a problem with the 1640 volume is finding
which of Benson's combined and retitled sonnets correspond to the numbers
in Thorpe's Quarto. Octavo get round this by having a side bar which lets
you hop to the poems in their 1609 numberings.
<p>
This is good stuff. And it is cheap: the Shakespeare volume is 25 US
dollars plus 3 dollars postage. Now think of a wish list (Milton's Poems
1645, the Jonson Folio, Herrick's Hesperides ...). Me, I'm waiting for the
Vesalius: can't wait to see all those bodies pulling their flesh off, and
all for 75 US dollars...

Spenserians and others may be interested in testing and commenting on the Search Engine for <cite>The Faerie Queene</cite> created by Matt Kozusko at the University of Georgia: <a href=http://virtual.park.uga.edu/~mkozusko/spenser/fqsearch.html>http://virtual.park.uga.edu/~mkozusko/spenser/fqsearch.html</a>. 
<p>
<strong>MIDDLETON ON-LINE</strong><br>
Surely one of the best electronic texts on offer. Chris Cleary
maintains this site based at the U of Virginia, and has so far
produced electronic editions of three-quarters of Middleton's
work (ranging from plays certainly written by Middleton alone to
dubious collaborations). This is an attractive set of pages and
the texts are clear and intelligently annotated; each play's
notes starts with a brief but sensible introduction. One of the
best features is that interesting points of vocabulary are not
only glossed but also linked, hypertextually, to other instances
in Middleton. Some of the notes are more extended and also make
use of links. Coming soon: the rest of the plays, and full
textual apparatus. As Cleary notes, these editions are not
refereed, but they have been undertaken carefully. Head for
<a href=http://dayhoff.med.virginia.edu/~ecc4g/middhome.html>http://dayhoff.med.virginia.edu/~ecc4g/middhome.html</a>.
<p>
<strong>ABRAHAM COWLEY ON-LINE ARCHIVE</strong><br>
New images are being added all the time at <a href=http://etext.virginia.edu/kinney/>http://etext.virginia.edu/kinney/</a>.
<p>
At present this site, maintained by Daniel Kinney, has two texts by Cowley
- <cite>The Third Part of the Works of Mr. Abraham Cowley Being his Six Books of
Plants</cite> (1689), and <cite>Translation of the Sixth Book of Mr. Cowley's Plantarum</cite> (1680) - which can be read and searched. It also has many pictures of Cowley, his works, and of many related sources.
<p>
As one would expect given its affiliation to the Electronic Text Center at
Virginia, this site is sensibly organised and the reproductions are very
good. The archive is introduced at <a href=http://etext.virginia.edu/kinney/about.html> http://etext.virginia.edu/kinney/about.html</a>.
<p>
<strong>DIGITISED BOOKS</strong><br>
For some interesting examples of whole books online, see the initiative at
the University of Mannheim, whose 'MATEO' (Mannheim Texts Online) presents
a rich selection of images of early prints and manuscripts:
<a href=http://www.uni-mannheim.de/mateo/epo.html>http://www.uni-mannheim.de/mateo/epo.html</a>.
More to the point, and in English, is the University of Pennsylvania's CETI
site: <a href=http://www.library.upenn.edu/etext/>http://www.library.upenn.edu/etext/</a>.
The major project there is 'Shakespeare and the English Renaissance', aimed
at producing a 'major archive of virtual Shakespeareana'. You can also read
about Penn's work on digitising STC and Wing prints for UMI. A whole slew
of digital texts are listed at
<a href=http://www.library.upenn.edu/etext/working/brett/index5.html>http://www.library.upenn.edu/etext/working/brett/index5.html</a>.
Beautifully indexed and presented, with generous picture quality, this
major archive already includes Daniel's Civil Wars (1609), works by Gosson,
Erasmus, Hariot, Heywood, much Shakespeare (including comparative sets of
prints of Lear, R&J, Merchant, Hamlet), and a huge amount of Holinshed. A
glimpse of the future.
<p>
<strong>ETEXT OF GASCOIGNE'S POSIES (1575)</strong><br>
<a href=http://leeharrison.simplenet.com/bwp/gg/index.html>http://leeharrison.simplenet.com/bwp/gg/index.html</a>
A decent looking etext of the 1907 CUP edition. This of course includes the
Adventures of Master F.I. in his Italian guise and Gascoigne's important
'Notes of instruction concerning the making of verse'. The pages are part
of Lee Harrison's 'Big Wind Press', which has also produced an etext of
Dekker's Gull's Hornbook (based on McKerrow) and other non-Renaissance
goodies: <a href=http://leeharrison.simplenet.com/bwp/>http://leeharrison.simplenet.com/bwp/</a>.
<p>
<strong>GLASGOW UNIVERSITY EMBLEMS WEBSITE</strong><br>
This site specialises in French emblematic texts, and includes a digitised
version of a French Alciato of 1536, as well as a short title catalogue of
the Stirling Maxwell Collection of Emblem Books, and info and links:
<a href=http://www.gla.ac.uk/Library/Emblems/>http://www.gla.ac.uk/Library/Emblems/</a>
<p>
<strong>EARLY MODERN ENGLISH DICTIONARIES DATABASE</strong><br>
When complete, this could turn out to be outstandingly useful. As
it stands, it is already a considerable resource. The principle
behind this project, edited by Ian Lancashire, is to collect
early dictionary materials and make them searchable. Head for the
start page at <a href=http://www.chass.utoronto.ca:8080/english/emed/emedd.html>http://www.chass.utoronto.ca:8080/english/emed/emedd.html</a>.
Here you'll find a useful introduction to EMEDD, including a
history of the project, and reflections on the nature of
renaissance word-meanings etc.
<p>
The present EMEDD includes 18 works at various stages of
completion:
<ul>
<li>six bilingual dictionaries - John Palsgrave (1530;
English-French), Sir Thomas Elyot (1538; Latin- English), William
Thomas (1550; Italian-English), Thomas Thomas (1587;
Latin-English), John Florio (1598; Italian-English), and Randle
Cotgrave (1611; French-English) - these give pairs of French,
Italian, and Latin dictionaries, each pair separated by 50-80
years.
<li>four English hard-word dictionaries - Edmund Coote (1596), Robert
Cawdrey (1604; courtesy of Raymond Siemens), John Bullokar (1616),
and Henry Cockeram (1623) - and one English word-list by Richard
Mulcaster (1582).
<li>the first full English-only dictionary - Thomas Blount (1656).
<li>three specialized lexicons - William Turner on herbal names
(1548), Henry Mainwearing on maritime words (1644), and John
Garfield on scientific terms (1657).
<li>four treatises with substantial glossing - Pierre Valence on
French grammar (1528), Richard Sherry on schemes (1550) and on
figures (1555), and George Puttenham on the English poetics
(1589).
</ul>
<p>
The 11 of these which are currently in presentable form can be
searched using 'Patterweb', a search device created by Mark Catt.
This allows intelligent and flexible searching, e.g. with
combination searches, searching through dictionaries individually
or as a group. It is possible to search for words near each other
(e.g. pawn near chess) or NOT near each other (pawn not near
chess) which is a clever idea. The search page is
<a href=http://www.chass.utoronto.ca/english/emed/patterweb.html>http://www.chass.utoronto.ca/english/emed/patterweb.html</a>. Available: Palsgrave, William Thomas, Mulcaster, Thomas Thomas, Coote, Minsheu, Cawdrey, Bullokar, Cockeram, Blount, Garfield.
<p>
EMEDD is part of the older and larger Edicta project which
incorporates similar projects relating to French and Latin. Find
out more, and use the links, at
<a href=http://www.chass.utoronto.ca:8080/~wulfric/edicta/intro.htm>http://www.chass.utoronto.ca:8080/~wulfric/edicta/intro.htm</a>.
<p>
Interestingly and conveniently a recent Special Issue of the
on-line journal EMLS features uses of the dictionary database
mainly relating to Shakespeare. Seek inspiration at
<a href=http://www.humanities.ualberta.ca/emls/si-01/si-01toc.html>http://www.humanities.ualberta.ca/emls/si-01/si-01toc.html</a>
Most of these essays grew out of Ian Lancashire's graduate course
on Shakespeare's language offered at the University of Toronto in
1995-96.
<p>
<strong>SHAKE-SPEARES SONNETS (1609)</strong><br>
The Web Development Group of the University of Toronto Library has just
published an edition of SHAKE-SPEARES SONNETS (1609) edited by Hardy M. Cook
and Ian Lancashire as part of Renaissance Electronic Texts (RET 3.1).
Renaissance Electronic Texts is a "series of old-spelling, SGML- encoded
editions of early individual copies of English Renaissance books and
manuscripts, and of plain transcriptions of such works, published on the
World Wide Web as a free resource for students of the period", under the
general editorship of Ian Lancashire. The edition is at:
<a href=http://www.library.utoronto.ca/www/utel/ret/ret.html>http://www.library.utoronto.ca/www/utel/ret/ret.html</a>.
<p>
<strong>MONTPELLIER EARLY MODERN ENGLISH DOCUMENTS (MEMED)</strong><br> 
...is at <a href=http://alor.univ-montp3.fr/MEMED/>http://alor.univ-montp3.fr/MEMED/</a>.
<p>
Currently this service is offering <cite>A Declaration of the Sentence and
Deposition of Elizabeth, the usurper and pretensed Queen of England</cite> (1588),
<cite>The Pater Noster, the Creed, and the commandments of God in English, with
many other godly lessons, right necessary for youth and all other to learn
and to know, according to the commandment and injunctions given by the
authority of the king's highness through this his realm</cite> (1538), and William
Elderton's <cite>A New Ballad declaring the dangerous shooting of the gun at court</cite> (1579).
<p>
All of these are in HTML format although it is planned that all documents
will eventually be offered in RTF format as well (RTF will be more easily
accommodated by your word-processing software). More transcriptions are
underway.
<p>
Also now based at the University of Montpellier is the home-page of the
Societe Francaise Shakespeare: <a href=http://alor.univ-montp3.fr/serinf/SFS/>http://alor.univ-montp3.fr/serinf/SFS/</a>. This has details of the Society, and details of its activities and congresses since 1979.
<p>
The Centre d'Etudes et de Recherches sur la Renaissance Anglaise has a
large collection of Shakespearean videos which have been catalogued at
<a href=http://alor.univ-montp3.fr/serinf/CERRA/Shakespeare_Multimedia/>http://alor.univ-montp3.fr/serinf/CERRA/Shakespeare_Multimedia/
</a>.  The list gives a lot of information about each film and could help solve
those 'who was that guy who played Macduff in that weird version which was
all dark' questions.
<p>
<strong>AENEID BOOK 13 ONLINE</strong><br>
Maffeo Vegio's addition of a thirteenth book to the Aeneid has never much
impressed modern readers but it was a common and significant accompaniment
to Virgil's epic in the Renaissance. Web hero David Wilson-Okamura has put
the text online, made it searchable, and included Twyne's translation. Good
work!  
<ul>
<li>Latin text (from the editio princeps, 1471)
<a href=http://www.virgil.org/supplementa/vegio-latin.htm>http://www.virgil.org/supplementa/vegio-latin.htm</a>
<li>English translation (by Thomas Twyne, 1584) <a href=http://www.virgil.org/supplementa/vegio-twyne.htm>http://www.virgil.org/supplementa/vegio-twyne.htm</a>
<li>Search Vegio's text <a href=http://www.virgil.org/texts>http://www.virgil.org/texts</a>
</ul>
To try the search engine, first select 'Vegio's Supplementum' from the
'Query scope' pull-down menu. Or, to compare Vegio's usage with Virgil's,
select 'Vegio's Supplement & Virgil's works.'

<strong>LITERATURE ONLINE LATEST</strong><br>
Apart from some rather nasty things like a free database of love poems
called Lionheart, LION has added much of value in the last year. Many of our
gripes about its software have not been addressed, and the site continues to
purr sporadically under the latest version of Netscape and hiss rather too
ofen under Internet Explorer. Java back/forward links seem still not to work
with any consistency, but we must learn to be patient and not expect to get
what we pay for. So this is just a report on the addition of various new
databases. Under the less useful reference section we now find the Cambridge
Encyclopedia and Biographical Encyclopedia. The Literary Databases, which is
where the real action is, now include Chadwyck-Healey's Editions and
Adaptations of Shakespeare (as reviewed in CD-ROM form by Colin Burrow in
<a href=digest1.htm#eascdrom>Harvest, series 1</a>). Although not new, we should also mention the
Eighteenth-Century Fiction collection (Swift, Richardson, Fielding all
covered, and Tristram Shandy (1760 London edition) has EVERY SINGLE PAGE,
squiggles, blank, black, and marble pages, reproduced photographically, so
hurrah for C-H's good taste). Works in progress and already available in
part include Nineteenth-Century Fiction and Twentieth-Century American
Poetry. And of course, many of the pre-existent databases continue to grow
and improve. So we still love LION: <a href=http://lion.chadwyck.co.uk/>http://lion.chadwyck.co.uk/</a>

<cite>LION was first reviewed in Harvest Series II, now available in the Digest <a href=digest2.htm#lion>here</a>.</cite><p>
<strong>OXFORD TEXT ARCHIVE</strong><br>
OTA has redesigned its site to improve its functionality and navigation, and
to make use of the SGML metadata already encoded with their texts, so that
what you see is now what you get. The old address has a link to the new
site, which is at: <a href=http://firth.natcorp.ox.ac.uk/ota/public/index.shtml>http://firth.natcorp.ox.ac.uk/ota/public/index.shtml</a>.  OTA is in the process of putting free texts (remember, some are free, some
are free if you ask nicely, some cost, and some are very restricted indeed)
online, so rather than having, as before, to get by ftp a marked-up text
which you could not view, in future, we assume, you will be able to view it
in its glory within your browser, and then save it as html or plain text.
OTA is also in the process of making online texts searchable, that is,
Oxford is aiming to be the poor man's LION. We couldn't find anything that
was yet online, but the site is all there and ready for that day, and seems
well designed (links embedded within text are not always visible because of
the colour scheme, so just keep clicking at things).
<p>
<cite>The OTA was first reviewed in Harvest Series I, now available in the Digest <a href=digest1.htm#electexts>here</a>.</cite><p>
<strong>OCLC NOW HAS MLA BIBLIOGRAPHY!</strong><br>
Well, that says it all. The excellent, if rather over journalled and
under-bookish, MLA bibliography, previously available online to the lucky
few and to the rest of us on CD-ROM, is now to be had at OCLC FirstSearch.
There are various different URLs for either side of the big pond, but the
simplest to the basic homepage (follow links to FirstSearch) is
<a href=http://www.ref.oclc.org:2000/>http://www.ref.oclc.org:2000/</a> or
<a href=http://www.ref.uk.oclc.org:3000/>http://www.ref.uk.oclc.org:3000/</a> (for the U.K.).
You still need a password, so if you know what you're doing, go direct to,
for example <a href=http://jake.prod.oclc.org:3057/html/fs_homepage.htm>http://jake.prod.oclc.org:3057/html/fs_homepage.htm</a>.
Enter your authorisation and password, follow links to the Arts and
Humanities Database area, and try out MLA online. Search criteria will be
familiar to users of the CD-ROM/telnet versions, but the web version is so
much better: records can be tagged and emailed, you can search for entries
under one heading and then follow links to other entries for particular
authors you approve of. Records seem to be displayed in reverse order of
addition, so you get the newest first and you can follow them down until you
recognise what you came up with last time you looked. Perfection, basically.

<strong>ENGLISH SHORT TITLE CATALOGUE ON THE WEB</strong><br>
Which, as Richard Serjeantson observed in his review of the telnet version
(<a href=digest1.htm#stcol>Harvest, series 1</a>), should be English Long Title Catalogue. We have finally
got into the 'Eureka' web version, and can confirm that, alongside LION, it
is the best, most useful, and most seriously hardcore service yet available
to our kind of folk. And remember, it amalgamates STC, Wing, and the C18
STC, so you are no longer forced to pursue careers across the period
divides. As usual there are different addresses for different customers. Go
to <a href=http://eureka.thames.rlg.org/web/>http://eureka.thames.rlg.org/web/</a>
and they will ask for your password. Go to your subscribing institution
(library homepage for example) from within its domain (xxx.edu or xxx.ac.uk,
etc.) and you may be able to pick up a link direct to a page which bypasses
security. The first thing to do is 'select a file', if you don't want to
search the RLIN Bibliographic File to which Eureka defaults. There are so
many to choose from (anthropology, architecture, art) it's like a sweetshop
for librarians. But choose ESTC, and when you get there, it's best to go
straight on to the advanced search screen.
<p>
Here you can do wonderful things, and all we can really do is tantalise you
with a few hints. You can search by keyword, author, author word, title,
title word, subject, subject word, imprint, imprint word, imprint year,
imprint place, publication year, record ID, country of publication, genre,
language, words from general notes, exact citation, words from citation,
location words, and shelfmark. You can combine two criteria straightaway
with 'and', 'or', 'and not', and when you press 'send' it will display a
list in brief format of possible results (typically authors with the same
surname either side of the one you were looking for). You then tick the one
you want and 'send' again for another brief list of results. Tick any or all
and you get the wonderfully rich ESTC entries with all their accumulated
information about contents and individual copies. If you conduct a new
search you can click on 'review' for a list of the searches you've done, and
then merge them to get only those entries by author X published between 1640
and 1660 with a certain bookseller's name on the title page, or whatever.
<p>
Once you've got to the full record display you will see things highlighted
which can lead to serious serendipity doodah. Click on the imprint line for
a list of similar imprints, from the same printer AND stationer to their
collaborations with others. Click on the author for the obvious, on the
title for similar titles, on other names, or initials, involved for lists of
their other entries, and on the generic descriptions for lists of similar
works; some of the 'subject' headings seem bizarre or random, but if this is
allowed for you will find yourself on a fruitful browse through the
literature of vernacular prophecy or anti-catholic polemic. And at this
stage the long titles are a great advantage as you stand a chance of
understanding something of the contents from them, especially when they are
supplemented by statements of what sort of a work this is, and what it
contains. And keep browsing, for you will find much tucked away in the notes
from reporting libraries, the sort of 'This is Love's Labour's Won reissued
with a different title page' thing which librarians like to keep to
themselves. You can 'export' full entries to yourself in various formats,
but as none of these will look quite as nice as the screen in front of you,
the best thing is to print the current file as well.
<p>
There are a few odd glitches which will sometimes not take you to a work you
know exists when you enter its exact title, but more general searches
(author plus title word) will get you there in more roundabout fashion. ESTC
on the web makes possible all sorts of sophisticated searches in minutes
which used to demand days of poring over, cross- referencing, and copying
from, STC or Wing. And remember that the entries list the UMI call number,
so you can go straight to the microfilm if (heaven forfend) you actually
want to read the text. Wondrous.
<p>
<cite>NB Netscape 2.x, 3.x, or 4.x, or Microsoft Internet Explorer 4.0 needed to
access Eureka.</cite>
<p>
<strong>ESTC TIP OF THE YEAR</strong><br>
We had not before worked out the obvious - how to search ESTC (the
amalgamated online STC, Wing, and C18 STC) by, say, STC number. The answer:
on 'Advanced Search', select 'Words from Citations' and type 'STC 18153',
or whatever. This will also search for references to other standard
bibliographies, so sometimes you will get two records because one has your
STC number as its Steele number, for example. But it seems to work pretty
well.

<strong>ARDEN SHAKESPEARE SITE (ArdenNet)</strong><br>
With the 3rd series of editions in progress and an excellent CD-ROM, the
people at Arden Shakespeare are striving to monopolise academic
Shakespeare. The Internet's possibilities could one day make a bit of a
mockery of print dominance, so they've made a bold attempt to get into the
action in this arena as well.
<p>
Head for the Arden Shakespeare website at: <a href=http://www.ardenshakespeare.com/main/welcome.html>http://www.ardenshakespeare.com/main/welcome.html</a>.
<p>
There's a lot here - or rather, there's a framework for a lot here. This
site depends on enthusiastic input from an imagined constituency of
electronic scholars. The fact that this constituency has not been proved to
exist anywhere else yet (although the FICINO list and its kind come close)
is the problem: and the question facing us is, as CERES has trumpeted
before, whether to be part of the problem, or part of the solution.
<p>
To get started you'll need to surrender some not very intimate information
and think up a password. By the way, some would say that it would be a good
idea not to use the same password for everything.
<p>
The site is organised under headings which cover a wide range of content.
You should know that the following chirpy-sounding list mainly uses the
ArdenNet's own wording:
<dl>
<dt><strong>Professional</strong></dt>
<dd>This section provides those involved in Shakespeare studies with the
everyday information they need in their work. Currently, it provides: a
listing of Shakespeare organisations; a calendar of Shakespeare
conferences; the opportunity for institutions to post employment vacancies
in the Shakespearean world.</dd>
<dt><strong>Internet</strong></dt>
<dd>This section groups together those essays and resources in ArdenNet which
relate to the wider Internet. Currently available are a review of sites
useful for Shakespeare research on the Internet by Gabriel Egan, and all
the links from this and other articles in ArdenNet.</dd>
<dt><strong>Scholarship</strong></dt>
<dd>The Scholarship section is the heart of ArdenNet - and members are invited
to participate. Its purpose is to exploit the potential of the World Wide
Web by providing a space for shorter pieces, 'work in progress' towards
academic papers, articles or books, or for discussion papers, ideas and
thoughts which are either too short or inappropriate for publication via
the currently available channels. Already available are an essay on
Shakespeare in the Electronic Age by Peter S. Donaldson and the transcript
of an interview with the RSC actor John Voss.</dd>
<dt><strong>News & Reviews</strong></dt>
<dd>The News and Reviews section is where to go for listings and comment about
Shakespeare books, multimedia and performances (on both stage and screen).
Highlights include theatre listings and reviews, and 'my favourite book'
and 'my favourite performance' selections from ArdenNet members. 'My
favourite' selections available include an account of Shakespeare on stage
in Nigeria from Martin Banham and Olwen Terris' account of an influential
set of Rossiter lectures in print.</dd>
<dt><strong>Teaching</strong></dt>
<dd>This area of ArdenNet is devoted to the discussion of teaching Shakespeare
- from high school to postgraduate level. It is intended to be an organic
resource which grows as ArdenNet members contribute their own thoughts and
experiences as short articles or multimedia pieces. Currently available are
essays from David Scott Kastan (on teaching textual Shakespeare) and
Rebecca Bushnell (on teaching Shakespeare using the Internet).</dd>
<dt><strong>Discussion</strong></dt>
<dd>Join the debates... ArdenNet invites members to join the community's
discussions of the issues raised by its resources.</dd>
</dl>
<p>
CERES offers its two-penn'orth: as was hinted above, it's easy to summarise
the state of play: the system is there, and the space available, to create
a really substantial forum for electronic discussion. Whether we are yet at
the technological watershed which will suddenly make this work well is
unclear. Hope springs eternal, and Arden has many influential friends, so
keep an eye on ArdenNet.
<p>
<strong>ARDENNET UPDATE</strong><br>
New: the publication, exclusive to ArdenNet, of research from
Eric Rasmussen and a team of graduate students purporting to shed new light
on the manuscript used to typeset and print the second quarto of Hamlet and
challenging the conventional belief that it was set from "foul papers".
Visit the Scholarship section for the full text of the paper. Additionally,
as usual, full listings of performances and recently released Shakespeare
books are available through the News and Reviews pages. Also included are
full details of Shakespeare Festivals throughout the United States and the
London Shakespeare's Globe Theatre season. ArdenNet is at
<a href=http://www.ardenshakespeare.com/ardennet/>http://www.ardenshakespeare.com/ardennet/</a>
<p>
<strong>DISSERTATION ABSTRACTS ONLINE</strong><br>
MLA continues to include citations for Dissertation Abstracts International
entries, but you may wish to go straight to the horse's mouth (providing
your institution subscribes): <a href=http://wwwlib.umi.com/dissertations/>http://wwwlib.umi.com/dissertations/</a> 
Clearly UMI just don't care any more. Not only are they thinking the
unthinkable and preparing to digitise the 20,000+ microfilmed STC volumes,
but they are also doing the same with doctoral dissertations. You will be
shocked to discover that not only can you read and print off dissertation
abstracts, but for the most recent entries (and the most recent are
displayed first), you can add the dissertation to your shopping basket (just
as at any of the online bookshops, such as <a href=http://www.amazon.com>www.amazon.com</a> or
<a href=http://www.bookshop.co.uk>www.bookshop.co.uk</a>), go to the checkout, and for an even 50 dollars acquire
the right to download 15MB or so of digitised dissertation. You can then
print off a camera-ready, or perhaps oven-ready, text of the latest madcap
modern claptrap or promising scholarship. Extraordinary. You need a PDF
reader, but they tell you what that is and how to get it.
<p>
DAI leaves the UK well alone, and who can blame it? Fortunately, searchers
for British dissertations are now almost equally well served by the Index to
Theses website: <a href=http://www.theses.com/>http://www.theses.com/</a>.  
Entries are displayed in no particular order, but as there are fewer, this
is not yet a problem. A particularly silly feature is the fourfold
discrimination 'quick search', 'simple search', 'standard search', 'advanced
search' (the latter is encoded with such complicated logic that you need a
Ph.D. in information analysis just to use it - very British), but the
'simple' and 'standard' do allow you to do interesting and useful things
like searching by University and by title keywords using and/or.
<p>
And, a reminder that musicological theses are abstracted at:
<a href=http://www.music.indiana.edu/ddm/>http://www.music.indiana.edu/ddm/</a>.
<p>
<strong>ARTS AND HUMANITIES DATA SERVICE</strong><br>
The Joint Information Systems Committee of the United Kingdom's Higher
Education Funding Councils (or rather, the JISC of the UK's HEFCs) fund
this attempt to collect and catalogue and offer good quality electronic
resources on-line. Those who are in love with the Internet's fragmented
side and who enjoy picking up a text of Milton in Perth and then a text of
Marvell in the other Perth won't see the point of it, but there is
something to be said for a body which considers the best ways of creating
publicity, access, and protocols for serious research resources which have
often taken a lot of effort to produce. Also, the one thing education
systems need is lots of committees, as any member of the NAFH working group
of the PTTP committee of CERES can tell you.
<p>
So far the literary material is basically the Oxford Text Archive and the
link from AHDS sends you straight there. We already have a link to OTA on
our web page so that's not a great advance. The History materials are more
impressive although AHDS again acts as a central linking hub. One of CERES'
most oft-repeated sententiae is that there is a lot of potential here and
it could become a wonderful resource (particularly in this case for its
interdisciplinary possibilities) BUT that depends on the contributions made
by people like us. At this stage the food for thought here is mainly for
those who are thinking of putting resources on-line themselves. Find the
AHDS at <a href=http://ahds.ac.uk>http://ahds.ac.uk</a>.
<p>
<strong>INTERNET PUBLIC LIBRARY: ONLINE LITERARY CRITICISM COLLECTION</strong><br>
The Online Literary Criticism Collection contains links to 1180 critical and
biographical websites about authors and their works that can be browsed by
author, by title, or by literary period. The Renaissance list is at:
<a href=http://www.ipl.org/cgi-bin/ref/litcrit/litcrit.out.pl?pd=British:+1500-1700>http://www.ipl.org/cgi-bin/ref/litcrit/litcrit.out.pl?pd=British:+1500-1700</a>.
It includes mention of familiar names like EMLS and Renaissance Forum and a
few self-contained articles on the web. A list of authors at the bottom
leads to a page of links to discussions of the author, and his or her works
are then cross-referenced separately. All structure and little content as
yet, but with time this could become a useful bookmark.
<p>
<strong>EUROPEAN OPACS</strong><br>
A smattering of useful online union catalogues. For Italy:
<a href=http://opac.sbn.it/>http://opac.sbn.it/</a>. 
For Germany: <a href=http://dbix01.dbi-berlin.de:6100/DBI/login.html>http://dbix01.dbi-berlin.de:6100/DBI/login.html</a>.  
Also worth investigating is the Karlsruher Virtueller Katalog (KVK), which
marshals a number of opac resources:
<a href=http://www.ubka.uni-karlsruhe.de/kvk.html>http://www.ubka.uni-karlsruhe.de/kvk.html</a>.
Still no sign of a web based catalogue at the Bibliotheque Nationale, but
the site is so pretty in other respects that we'll give the URL anyway:
<a href=http://www.bnf.fr/index.htm>http://www.bnf.fr/index.htm</a>.
<p>
<strong>MANUSCRIPTS AND ARCHIVES</strong><br>
NUCMC, or the National Union Catalog of Manuscript Collections, is a
free-of-charge cooperative cataloging program operated by the Library of
Congress at <a href=http://lcweb.loc.gov/coll/nucmc/>http://lcweb.loc.gov/coll/nucmc/</a>.
Searchable, though a bit of a blunt instrument at present. Relatedly, the
UK's National Register of Archives is now available in a web version:
<a href=http://www.hmc.gov.uk/nra/overnra.htm>http://www.hmc.gov.uk/nra/overnra.htm</a>.
<p>
<strong>CENTRE FOR THE HISTORY OF THE BOOK</strong><br>
The CHB at Edinburgh is an international and interdisciplinary centre for
advanced research into all aspects of the material culture of the text -
its production, circulation, and reception from manuscript to the
electronic text. The website includes information about such projects as
the History of the Book in Scotland: <a href=http://www.ed.ac.uk/englit/research/chb/>http://www.ed.ac.uk/englit/research/chb/</a>.
<p>
<strong>ITALNET</strong><br>
ItalNet is an international consortium whose mission is to make available
scholarly Internet resources of literary and historical materials relating
to Italian studies: <a href=http://www.italnet.nd.edu/>http://www.italnet.nd.edu/</a>
Especially noteworthy is the Opera del Vocabolario Italiano (OVI) textual
database. The database contains 1,369 vernacular texts (16.4 million words)
dated prior to 1375, the year of Boccaccio's death. The verse and prose
works include early masters of Italian literature like Dante, Petrarch, and
Boccaccio, as well as lesser-known and obscure texts by poets, merchants,
and medieval chroniclers. The OVI database was created to aid in the
compilation of an historical dictionary of the Italian language, the Tesoro
della lingua italiana delle origini, portions of which are now available
on-line from the OVI website (follow the links). Registration is currently
free: <a href=http://ovisun199.csovi.fi.cnr.it/italnet/OVI/index_en.html>http://ovisun199.csovi.fi.cnr.it/italnet/OVI/index_en.html</a>.
<p>
<strong>THE MEDICI ARCHIVE</strong><br>
The Medici Archive Project, based at Johns Hopkins, was founded in 1995 in
order to realise the undeveloped potential of the Medici Granducal Archive,
housed in the Archivio di Stato in Florence. There are 3 areas of activity:
Documentary Sources for the Arts and Humanities, 1537-1743; Jewish History,
Religion and Culture in the Medici Granducal Archive, 1537-1743; and
History of Costume and Textiles in the Medici Granducal Archive. A guided
tour will tell you all about the enormous archive, and this effort to bring
its resources online: <a href=http://www.jhu.edu/~medici/>http://www.jhu.edu/~medici/</a>
<p>
<strong>SHAKESPEARE ELECTRONIC ARCHIVE AT THE FOLGER</strong><br>
The Shakespeare Electronic Archive is now available to readers at the
Folger Shakespeare Library. This is a collection of electronic resources,
including The Oxford Electronic Edition, based on the Wells and Taylor
Complete Works, and numerous electronic transcriptions and images. And it
all sounds like it's linked together in interesting ways. More to follow as
well.
<p>
Unless you actually go to the Folger you can't get at it but there is a
public website, 'Hamlet on the Ramparts', containing a wide range of
materials relevant to Hamlet 1.4 and 1.5, under construction. You can link
to the Folger website from the <a href=links.htm>CERES links page</a>.
<p>
SRASP!...
...stands for Shakespeare and Renaissance Association [of West Virginia]:
Selected Papers. This new annual electronic journal publishes the best
papers from the yearly West Virginia Shakespeare and Renaissance
Conference. Volumes 20 (1997) and 21 (1998) can now be accessed through the
WWW: <a href=http://www.marshall.edu/engsr/indexsr.html>http://www.marshall.edu/engsr/indexsr.html</a>

<strong>OXFORD EARLY PRINTED BOOKS PROJECT</strong><br>
Head for the website at <a href=http://saturn.las.ox.ac.uk/icc/resource.html>http://saturn.las.ox.ac.uk/icc/resource.html</a>.
This is a project intended to catalogue books in Oxford libraries outside
the Bodleian but it also has a very good survey of resources for
bibliographers web-wide.
<p>
<strong>SWEET 'N' LOW</strong><br>
The Shakespeare Society of the Low Countries has just opened its home- page
at <a href=http://shakespeare.let.ruu.nl/>http://shakespeare.let.ruu.nl/</a>  
The page is bilingual, Dutch and English, and includes tables of contents
for past issues of the Society's journal, Folio, and some Shakespearian
links. In the years to come, they are hoping to extend the site into a
useful resource for all scholars who are interested in Shakespeare studies
in general, and in Dutch and Flemish contributions to Shakespeare
scholarship, translations, performances and so on, in particular. Any
suggestions are welcome.

<strong>ELECTRONIC SIXTEENTH CENTURY JOURNAL</strong><br>

underpublicised. So we are publicising it again: <a href=http://www.truman.edu/escj/home.html>http://www.truman.edu/escj/home.html</a>. Like many journal websites it has a nice logo but is a little thin
on content. One or two features do have the potential to save shoe

Sixteenth Century Journal, and the list, in full and brief formats
and with an index, of books in the Sixteenth Century Essays and

<strong>ELIZABETHAN REVIEW</strong><br>
This is an on-line journal of less standing than some and, I am
afraid to report, takes an unhealthy interest in the question of
whether the Earl of Oxford wrote Shakespeare's plays. Still, some
of its output is on-line and there may be things of interest. You

<strong>RENAISSANCE NEWS AND NOTES</strong><br>
The latest issue of Renaissance News and Notes, including information and
registration forms for the 1999 RSA conference, has just been put on the
RSA website  (<a href=http://www.r-s-a.org>http://www.r-s-a.org</a>).
<p>
<strong>EXPLORATIONS IN RENAISSANCE CULTURE</strong><br>
Another nice journal website, with information and tables of contents. URL: <a href=http://www.smsu.edu/English/eirc/eirc.html>http://www.smsu.edu/English/eirc/eirc.html</a>.
<p>
<strong>BIDS AUTOJOURNALS</strong><br>
Find out about this service at <a href=http://www.bids.ac.uk/news/autojnls.html>http://www.bids.ac.uk/news/autojnls.html</a>. The deal is that BIDS will e-mail the Contents Pages of journals when they
are catalogued at BIDS - which is very frequently. If you love browsing the
periodicals shelves then this will spoil your fun, but do you really catch
everything of interest? Really?
<p>
One wonderful feature is that you can customize your own list of journals
from the huge list at BIDS. Although it can take quite a while to trawl
through and choose the ones you want, this can be very useful as it points
to which periodicals aren't there. BIDS is great, but it is not perfect.
Then again, the MLA Bibliography doesn't do this (or we don't think it does
anyway). If your institution is with the programme, enjoy!
<p>
<strong>SIDNEY-L ARCHIVED</strong><br>
Archives of the Sidney-L e-mail discussion list are now available for
viewing and searching at <a href=http://info.uoguelph.ca/archives/sidney-l.html>http://info.uoguelph.ca/archives/sidney-l.html</a>. 
A reminder that the Sidney Journal website is just next door at
<a href=http://www.uoguelph.ca/englit/sidney>http://www.uoguelph.ca/englit/sidney</a>
<p>
<strong>H-HISTBIBL</strong><br>
A list devoted to 'the study and practice of History librarianship',
H-HistBibl is an international network for librarians, archivists,
curators, and scholars interested in the practice and study of
bibliographic and library services in support of historical study and
teaching. Further info at the H-Net site: <a href=http://www.h-net.msu.edu/>http://www.h-net.msu.edu/</a>
<p>
<strong>SHAKSPER ARCHIVE</strong><br>
The web-based archive of the SHAKSPER discussion list maintained by
Interactive Early Modern Literary Studies (iEMLS) has just been updated and
now includes everything up to the end of 1998. All the materials are now
available directly from the LISTSERV, and there have been various helpful
reorganisations: the biographies of subscribers have been combined into an
A-Z listing and the full-text logs of the discussions have been 'bound'
into yearly volumes. The URL of the archive is
<a href=http://www.humanities.ualberta.ca/emls/iemls/shaksper/shak-L.html>http://www.humanities.ualberta.ca/emls/iemls/shaksper/shak-L.html</a>.

<h2 align=center>CERES Specials</h2>
<strong>ONLINE GLORIANA: SIMPLY THE BESS!</strong><br>
CERES headed off around the internet to see what sort of presence Queen
Elizabeth I could boast. Not surprisingly the most pleasing discoveries
were reproductions of pictures, especially portraits, but there were other
things of value. Disappointingly only one communication from the spirit
world was turned up, and CERES fears that the medium involved may be a bit
of a crank. No, really.
<p>
<cite><big>portraits</big></cite><br>
There is a general Elizabethan site at <a href=http://tudor.simplenet.com/>http://tudor.simplenet.com/</a>.  
This is good stuff: the enthusiastic owner tells stories and puts down the
facts. There are also plenty of pics of the main players in the Tudor
period. The site also includes material on Tudor architecture, including a few
examples not in the CERES list of renaissance buildings on the web.  The best yield from this site is probably a nice row of Elizabeth portraits at <a href=http://tudor.simplenet.com/elizabeth/gallery.html>http://tudor.simplenet.com/elizabeth/gallery.html</a>.
<p>
There is typically gorgeous stuff from Luminarium at
<a href=http://www.luminarium.org/renlit/elizface.htm>http://www.luminarium.org/renlit/elizface.htm</a>.  
Lots of portraits, beautifully presented, although with (hem hem) an
ungainly use of terminal long 's'.  Luminarium's list of links is very good, connecting to genealogies,
biographies, etc. Don't get excited by the thought of an Elizabeth I Barbie
Doll. That link does not work: outrageous! Plenty of other good things at
<a href=http://www.luminarium.org/renlit/elizlink.htm>http://www.luminarium.org/renlit/elizlink.htm</a>.
<p>
<cite><big>elizabethan bacon?</big></cite><br>
Permit yourselves a small chuckle at the description of a Hilliard painting
as 'Elizabeth and her Son' at <a href=http://www.sirbacon.org/gallery/liz2.html>http://www.sirbacon.org/gallery/liz2.html</a>.  In fact the Baconians who run this site have a very good explanation for
all this: Elizabeth's two sons were Essex (of course!) and Francis Bacon.
To find out exactly what was going on here I had to pass through the main
page of the site (<a href=http://www.sirbacon.org>http://www.sirbacon.org</a>) which features Bacon riding a
motorbike decorated with the words 'Francis Bacon Is Shakespeare'. The next
page I reached said that Bacon's plays have been attributed to 'William
Shakespeare, an illiterate peasant'. At this point I came over all
intolerant and set fire to my computer. I did not find out exactly what was
going on.  But I did see a very attractive page with the astrological charts of the
Queen and her (gulp) son, Francis Tudor Bacon (double gulp). It looks
lovely at <a href=http://www.sirbacon.org/links/charts.htm>http://www.sirbacon.org/links/charts.htm</a>, but it means, er, whatever you decide, dear reader.
<p>
<cite><big>works</big></cite><br>
For Elizabeth's works (poems, speeches, letters) head for Luminarium again.
You can link to online versions of her works from here, some of which are
held at Luminarium itself. Others are at Toronto (head for
<a href=http://library.utoronto.ca/www/utel/rp/indexauthors.html>http://library.utoronto.ca/www/utel/rp/indexauthors.html</a>).
<p>
The Brown Women Writers Project, which has featured in our pages many times before, is due ever more respect for its contribution to the Elizabeth trawl.  There are various collections at
<a href=http://swansong.stg.brown.edu:1081/dynaweb/>http://swansong.stg.brown.edu:1081/dynaweb/</a>. Two are particularly relevant to CERES, one being 'In Her Own Words: Elizabeth I Onstage and Online'. This has some detailed contextual material and texts of the surviving speeches. It is a high-level resource and the
software does a decent job.  The other thing to check out here is 'Renaissance Women Online', with its
many texts, contextual materials, and more general essays. This is another
example of how those working on women's writing are making particularly
good use of the opportunities offered by electronic media.
<p>
DynaWeb's strategy of using multiple windows makes it very clear where you are in the database.  In the end, this adds an enormous amount to these materials, outweighing the disadvantage of the smaller
window size.  If you prefer a more conventional approach, you can get to the Elizabeth materials (and find out that 'In
Her Own Words' is also a series of performances) in a more run-of-the-mill
format via <a href=http://www.wwp.brown.edu/rich/QEIhome.html>http://www.wwp.brown.edu/rich/QEIhome.html</a>.  For more information on DynaWeb software, see <a href=http://www.inso.com/>http://www.inso.com/</a>.
<p>
<cite><big>handwriting</big></cite><br>
Samples of Elizabeth's handwriting abound.  There's a copy of the queen's signature at
<a href=http://www.handwriting.org/images/samples/qelizab1.htm>http://www.handwriting.org/images/samples/qelizab1.htm</a>.  You can find Henry VIII's scribble at the same site, and between the two
English monarchs in the index of 'Political Leaders' is Ross Perot.
Bizarre. They have several samples of Bill Clinton, all (fortunately) in
ink.  Other versions of the signature include <a href=http://www.mala.bc.ca/~Lepage/Eliza.htm>http://www.mala.bc.ca/~Lepage/Eliza.htm</a> and <a href=http://tudor.simplenet.com/elizabeth/signature.gif>http://tudor.simplenet.com/elizabeth/signature.gif</a>(too clear to be true?).  As far as more prosey autographs go, there is a nice image of a document in which Elizabeth grants lottery cash to the Free Grammar School in Bury St Edmunds, available at <a href=http://www.suffolkcc.gov.uk/libraries_and_heritage/sro/e5_9_102.html>http://www.suffolkcc.gov.uk/libraries_and_heritage/sro/e5_9_102.html</a>.
<p>
<cite><big>elizabeth's sayings</big></cite><br>
In an unusual perspective, five of Elizabeth I's most famous sayings are connected to five different
kinds of creativity by the good people at bemorecreative.com. Now CERES
didn't find itself very inspired by this, but you may feel that cynicism is
our biggest problem.  Think creatively by starting at <a href=http://www.bemorecreative.com/one/612.htm>http://www.bemorecreative.com/one/612.htm</a>.
<p>
<cite><big>elizabethan costume</big></cite><br>
If you're interested in Elizabethan costume, your best bet is to find your own path through the shimmering depths of  
<a href=http://www.dnaco.net/~aleed/corsets/general.html>http://www.dnaco.net/~aleed/corsets/general.html</a>.
This site has everything from the history of the Elizabethan corset to
instructions on how to make a genuine Elizabethan bumroll. Much of the site
is made up of instructions on how to make your own garments, but there is also
general historical material. You can even search the wardrobe accounts of  Mary Tudor and Edward IV, an excellent feature which, sadly, wasn't working
when CERES had a go. Still, if anyone finds out how many black lace
petticoats Edward IV had, you know who wants to know. There are links to
pictures of Elizabethan costume all over this site, and there is a good
annotated bibliography from which you can leap to Amazon.com to order the
books in question.  If CERES gave out some kind of award, this site would get two; Drea Leed, creator of this site, we salute you!
<p>
<strong>JAMESTOWN REDISCOVERY</strong><br>
The Association for the Preservation of Virginia Antiquities keeps a website
at <a href=http://www.apva.org/>http://www.apva.org/</a>.  Excavations and discoveries continue on the site of James I's settlement in
Virginia. This site offers historical background, description of recent
discoveries, plans for the future, and information about visiting. Some of
the pages use a fairly basic question and answer format, but the information
and presentation are usually interesting.
<p>
Williamsburg Online also has Jamestown pages, which are aimed at potential
visitors and have background information. Find out what's available at
<a href=http://www.williamsburg.com/james/james.html>http://www.williamsburg.com/james/james.html</a>.
The main site at <a href=http://www.williamsburg.com>http://www.williamsburg.com</a> is a feast of colonial
American fun.
<p>
<strong>AND ROANOKE TOO</strong><br>
Lots of recent archaeology in Roanoke too, some of which is described on the Web.
A good starting point is <a href=http://scrtec.org/track/tracks/t00428.html>http://scrtec.org/track/tracks/t00428.html</a>.
This is a kind of public service thingummy called Trackstar, featuring lists of resources aimed at education. From here you can reach various resources related to discoveries about the mysterious lost colony.
The most interesting link is to news of a discovery in 1996 of a possible
Croatan Indian site, at <a href=http://www.nando.net/newsroom/nao/nc/030696/nct_1686.html>http://www.nando.net/newsroom/nao/nc/030696/nct_1686.html</a>.
<p>
One potentially very useful resource is run by Tom Langford of the
International Internet Genealogical Society. For CERES purposes what is
offered here is information (numbers and names) about settlers heading for
colonies in the Americas. It has information about individual ships and
about settlements, so you can get a list of the Roanoke settlers. It is not
exhaustive or complete, but it is substantial. Start from <a href=http://www.primenet.com/~langford/>http://www.primenet.com/~langford/</a>.
<p>
Curiously enough, you can get Ralph Lane's account of the first Roanoke
colony, and John Smith's account of Jamestown, via the list of Historical
Documents put online by the National Center for Public Policy Research,
URL: <a href=http://www.nationalcenter.org/HistoricalDocuments.html>http://www.nationalcenter.org/HistoricalDocuments.html</a>. The NCPPR's list of documents, set out in chronological order, is
presumably designed to convert anyone who reads too many of them to
'Conservative' views, so CERES urges <strong>considerable caution</strong> in the use of
this site.  For an alternative view, head for the relevant section of Hakim Bey's 'The
Temporary Autonomous Zone' at <a href=http://www.notam.uio.no/~mariusw/bey/taz/taz.html#labelGoneToCroatan>http://www.notam.uio.no/~mariusw/bey/taz/taz.html#labelGoneToCroatan</a>.
<p>
There are links to various sources of online information about the Lost
Colony from <a href=http://www.kidinfo.com/American_History/Colonization_Roanoke.html>http://www.kidinfo.com/American_History/Colonization_Roanoke.html</a>.  However, it is possible that many CERES members are well-informed and/or
self-conscious enough not to want to visit any site called Kid Info.
<p>
Some of John White's engravings made during his time in the Roanoke colony can be
seen at <a href=http://www.philaprintshop.com/debry.html>http://www.philaprintshop.com/debry.html</a> as part of their De Bry
series. The Philadelphia Print Shop is actually trying to sell you things
at this site, but CERES emerged with wallet unscathed, although the
pictures are great.

<h2 align=center>The Weird and the Wonderful</h2>
<strong>MEDIEVAL AND RENAISSANCE GAMES</strong><br>
This meticulously-prepared page features a huge variety of games
from many periods and cultures. Rules, pictures, documents, and
discussions are all available, many of them on this site, and
others via links. It is aimed at the player rather than at the
scholar, which makes it quite a refreshing read, but it could
well be a highly useful and informative aid to those who wonder
about the rules of obscure games that crop up in their reading.
Get your dice and cards ready, and head for <a href=http://www.inmet.com/~justin/game-hist.html>http://www.inmet.com/~justin/game-hist.html</a>.
<p>
<strong>FLORIMENE ON THE WEB</strong><br>
This project is at heart a teaching resource, using electronic
media to guide students through 17th century staging via the
example of Florimene. Started in 1988, it has (not surprisingly)
changed its method considerably and the genesis of the current
WWW format takes up some space on the site, but it is
interesting. The material on staging is impressively technical
and represented in wonderfully bilious colours which recall the
great days of 1980s computing. For content and for its
demonstration of what can be done, this is worth a visit:
<a href=http://artsci.washington.edu/drama/flori1.html>http://artsci.washington.edu/drama/flori1.html</a>.
<p>
<strong>TYBURN TREE</strong><br>
A website devoted to public execution in early modern England,
including texts (a couple of homilies), selections from other
contemporary documents (Kyd, Pepys, Boswell, Newgate Calendar), a
few dying speeches, images, bibliography, and links. The site is
unfinished and apologises for this; its current sponsor clearly
wants to hand it over to someone else. Nevertheless, some stuff...
<a href=http://www.wantree.com.au/~halligan/tyburn.htm>http://www.wantree.com.au/~halligan/tyburn.htm</a>.
<p>
<strong>CULTURAL READINGS: COLONIZATION AND PRINT IN THE AMERICAS<br>
NEW ON LINE EXHIBITION</strong><br>
This collaborative web site presents and interprets a wide variety of texts
- books, manuscripts, illustrations, maps, and artifacts - generated by
Europe's colonization of the Americas. Comparative and broad in scope, the
exhibition investigates Spanish, French, English, and Dutch 'readings' of
the New World and the 'readings' of Europeans made by many Native cultures.
Topics covered include the literature of colonial promotion; printed images
of Natives; Native responses to print; missionary activities; Indian
languages; the geographies of the New World; and captivity narratives. The
web site also contains essays by Louise Burkhart, Sabine MacCormack,
Michael Ryan, Daniel Slive, and Karim Tiro; bibliography; and web links.
Materials shown in 'Cultural Readings' are drawn from the collections of
the Jay I. Kislak Foundation; the Rosenbach Museum & Library; the
University of Pennsylvania's Department of Special Collections; and the
University of Pennsylvania Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology. Find it at <a href=http://www.library.upenn.edu/special/gallery/kislak/index/cultural.html>http://www.library.upenn.edu/special/gallery/kislak/index/cultural.html</a>.
<p>
<strong>NICE LINKS</strong><br>
Carlo Bajetta has been busy surfing and has come up with a long and cultured
list of links to all sorts of necessary (and a few sorts of unnecessary)
places, some of which may be new to you. So if you don't trust us to tell
you what you need to know, have a look at:
<a href=http://www.unicatt.it/library/milano/BancheDati/surf2.htm>http://www.unicatt.it/library/milano/BancheDati/surf2.htm</a>
<p>
<strong>RESOURCES IN ART HISTORY</strong><br>
Adrienne DeAngelis of Rutgers has started up a site called 'Resources in
Art History for Graduate Students', located at
<a href=http://www.eden.rutgers.edu/~acd>http://www.eden.rutgers.edu/~acd</a>.
This lists fellowships, grants, internships, symposia and other types of
assistance for graduate students in art history and related fields.
<p>
<strong>BROGAN'S ENGLISH VERSIFICATION</strong><br>
A complete version of Terry V.F. Brogan's English Versification, 1570-1980:
A Reference Guide in Acrobat PDF hypertext is now available at the
Versification web site. EVRG is, along with Brogan's bibliography "Metrici
and Rhythmici: A List" (also available at the Versification website), the
largest single research tool for global versification.
<a href=http://sizcol.u-shizuoka-ken.ac.jp/versif/VerseBiblio.html>http://sizcol.u-shizuoka-ken.ac.jp/versif/VerseBiblio.html</a>
<p>
<strong>ONLINE BIBLE-STUDY</strong><br>
I dare say that the use literary scholars might make of the resources at
<a href=http://www.biblestudytools.net/>http://www.biblestudytools.net/</a> may not be exactly what the organisers had in mind. However, this voluminous facility makes it very easy to trace
keywords through the Bible, and to undertake more subtle searches. At the
very least it could provide quick answers to vexing 'where did that come
from?' questions.
<p>
<strong>RENAISSANCE MARRIAGE</strong><br>
There is a site with information about weddings and marriage in the early
modern and medieval periods at <a href=http://www.spu.edu/~kst/bib/bib.html>http://www.spu.edu/~kst/bib/bib.html</a>. 
Some of the information is aimed at re-creating authentic ceremonies rather
than at historical research, but there is plenty there.
<p>
<strong>RENAISSANCE!</strong><br>
<a href=http://renaissance.dm.net>http://renaissance.dm.net</a><br>
This is another site with more than a toe dipped in 'Creative Anachronism'.
Lots of links and some info on the more flamboyant parts of cultural
context - heraldry, magic, sword-fighting, etc. The 'Compendium of Common
Knowledge' is a nice idea: a sort of retrospective commonplace book which
offers to 'Writers, Actors, and Re-Enactors' a synthesis of Elizabethan
culture. Lots of bite-sized info on clothes, money, duelling, food,
language, and many more: not pitched at a very high level, but enjoyable.
