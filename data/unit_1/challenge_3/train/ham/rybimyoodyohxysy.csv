<h2> Research Interests</h2>
My research in recent years has focused on modelling the middle
atmosphere (the stratosphere and mesosphere, between about 10 and 100
km altitude), with particular emphasis on dynamics and transport of
tracers.  Much of this work has been directed towards interpreting
data from earth-orbiting satellites, especially from Oxford's
<a href="http://www.atm.ox.ac.uk/group/isams/">ISAMS</a>
instrument on the Upper Atmosphere Research Satellite (UARS).
<p>
I also try to keep up an interest in atmospheric wave theory, when
I have time. This has led, among other things, to work with Andrew Wood on
atmospheric tides
(see Publications, below). I am also thinking a little about
gravity waves.
<p>
My book, <i> An Introduction to Atmospheric Physics</i> (see <a href="iaptoc.html">
Table of Contents</a>), aimed at
undergraduate physicists and other physical scientists, was published in 2000 by
<a href="http://uk.cambridge.org/order/WebBook.asp?ISBN=0521629586">Cambridge
University Press</a>.  Some corrections are given <a href="iapcorr.pdf">here</a>.

<h2> Teaching and Administration</h2>
I am currently Head of the Sub-Department of Atmospheric, Oceanic and Planetary
Physics. Much of my time during the university term is taken up by undergraduate
teaching and administration.
I lecture on geophysical fluid
dynamics in the final-year <a href="http://www.atm.ox.ac.uk/main/undergraduates/option.html">
Physics of Atmosphere and Oceans</a> course and on fluid dynamics in the third-year
<a href="http://www.atm.ox.ac.uk/user/andrews/fluids.html">Physics of Fluid Flows</a> course.
I currently organise the <i>Physics of Atmosphere and Oceans</i> course.

I am also a Fellow and Physics Tutor at
<a href="http://www.lmh.ox.ac.uk/">Lady Margaret Hall</a>,
where I give tutorials in a wide variety of undergraduate physics
courses.
