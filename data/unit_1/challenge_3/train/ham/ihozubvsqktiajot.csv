<p>
Since 90% of the mass of the atmosphere lies below an altitude of 17km, and
the mean radius of the Earth is about 6370km, a certain shallowness assumption
seems reasonable when designing a numerical model for weather prediction or
climate study. But it turns out that a dynamically consistent treatment,
given this shallowness assumption, requires neglect of part of the Coriolis 
force. This is unsettling because the Coriolis forfe is generally considered 
to be important in many aspects of meteorology and climatology. Also, the
assumption of shallowness involves neglect of conceptually important effects in the angular momentum balance. Over the years, the Met Office has put considerable effort into the development of <I>deep</I> atmosphere models, which allow a
full representation of the Coriolis force without violating consistency 
requirements or distorting the angular momentum balance. In this seminar, the Met Office's "Old" and "New" Dynamics -both deep formulations- will be contrasted with various shallow formulations, including the hydrostatic "Primitive
Equations" used by many other NWP and climite centres. The advantages of deep
models are currently greater physical acceptability and flexibility rather
than improved quantitative performance. However, there is now widespread 
interest in deep models, which can be seen as a natural development in global
atmospheric modelling.

If time allows -and with an eye to the future- the formulation of switchable
models will be considered. In such models, transition between deep and shallow
forms would involve only a few parameter changes rather than the extensive
modifications needed in current codes.
