The course will support the governments workforce remodelling as classroom assistants, especially Higher Level Teaching Assistants, take on an increasingly professional role and seek increased opportunities for professional development. It will support the governments agenda on inclusion and special services.

The course also addresses the Children Bill, which revolutionises the role of those associated with child support as well as the Every Child Matters programme, which seeks to integrate and personalise the education, social and health services supporting children with additional needs.

The programme will be comprised of six (20 credit) modules per year. They will be designed to enable participants to develop their own personal skills (key skills) alongside developing academic skills. The modules cover a wide range of areas directly applicable to working in educational settings. In each year, three core modules must be completed by all participants. 
A two-day Foundation Degree Induction Programme before the start of the course is a prerequisite.
