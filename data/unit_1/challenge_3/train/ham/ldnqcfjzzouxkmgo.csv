<i>Research Booklet 2007 (AOPP)</i><br>
<h1>Atmospheric, Oceanic and Planetary Physics</b></BR></h1>
<p><i>Professor D G Andrews</i>

<P>The sub-department's research focuses on the study of physical
processes in the atmospheres and oceans of the Earth and other
planets, using experimental and theoretical techniques. We have approximately
80 members, including nine permanent academic or research staff,
about 34 post-doctoral researchers and senior visitors, and about 30
graduate students.

<P>On the experimental side we develop space instruments for infrared
remote sensing of the structure and composition of planetary
atmospheres, especially the Earth's stratosphere and mesosphere. More
than ten of these instruments have been launched, either into Earth
orbit or to other planets; several new space experiments are under
development, including Earth-orbiting instruments to investigate
global change, and missions to Mercury, Venus and Mars. Extensive
overseas and domestic collaborations are involved, with industrial and
scientific centres in Europe and the USA.

<P>We are an important centre for theoretical atmospheric and oceanic
modelling. Our climate dynamics group studies the large-scale
behaviour of the atmosphere-ocean system and its response to external
drivers such as the increases in greenhouse gas levels responsible for
anthropogenic climate change. Other modelling of the Earth's
atmosphere focuses on large-scale dynamical and chemical-transport
processes relevant to climate, and on the interpretation of our
satellite data. We also use dynamical models of other planets,
including Mars and Jupiter, to interpret existing data and help plan
new observational missions.

<P>We also investigate fundamental geophysical fluid dynamics by means
of laboratory experiments on rotating, stratified fluids.

<H3>High resolution dynamics limb sounder (HIRDLS)</H3>

<P> The sub-department is collaborating with other groups in the UK
and USA on the HIRDLS remote sounding satellite instrument, launched
in mid 2004 on the EOS Aura satellite as part of NASA's Earth
Observing System. HIRDLS measures the concentration of trace species,
temperature and pressure variations in the Earth's atmosphere between
about 8 and 100 km altitude. Its primary aim is to measure at a much
finer spatial scale than previous instruments, to about 1 km vertical
resolution and 500 km horizontally. Part of the hardware was built at
Oxford and we performed extensive pre-launch calibration of the
instrument, using our purpose-built laboratory and test equipment. In
addition we are undertaking a number of software tasks concerned with
flight operations and data processing.

<H3>Michelson interferometer for passive atmospheric sounding
(MIPAS)</H3>

<P>MIPAS is one of the core experiments on ESA's Envisat satellite,
launched in March 2002. It measures infrared atmospheric limb emission
spectra over an altitude range 6-68 km; the primary goal is to obtain
profiles of atmospheric temperature and concentrations of CH4, H2O,
HNO3, N2O, NO2 and O3 in near-real-time. A key feature of MIPAS is
that it provides the first global set of spectrally-resolved data; in
principle this means that concentrations of many other species can
also be retrieved, as well as isotopic ratios, vibrational
temperatures, distribution of aerosol particles, tropospheric cirrus,
and stratospheric ice clouds (including polar stratospheric
clouds). Oxford has worked closely with other European groups in
developing the retrieval algorithm, with particular contributions to
the radiative transfer modelling, microwindow selection and error
analysis.

<P>MIPAS has now been operating for four years, and is expected to
continue until at least 2010, providing a unique dataset for
monitoring trends in atmospheric composition. Our main interests are
to extend the list of products which can be retrieved, particularly
those covered by the Montreal (CFCs) and Kyoto (Greenhouse gases)
protocols, and the determination of cloud properties from their
spectral signatures in low altitude measurements.

<H3> Tropospheric emission spectrometer (TES) and Infrared atmospheric
sounding interferometer (IASI)</H3>

<P>TES on the NASA Aura satellite (launched 2004) and IASI on European
MetOp satellite (launched in 2006) are both nadir-viewing infrared
interferometers. While TES is primarily an instrument for scientific
research (which also has a limb-viewing capability, similar to MIPAS),
IASI has been developed to assist with numerical weather prediction by
providing improved profiles of atmospheric temperature and
humidity. However, both instruments have similar spectral coverage and
resolution.

<P>Our aim is to adapt the temperature and atmospheric composition
retrieval techniques developed for limb sounding to the nadir case,
which involves accurate radiative transfer modelling, and use these
reference results to investigate alternative, fast retrieval methods
which can be used on an operational basis.

<P>Particular areas of interest are modelling of surface and clouds
within the field of view, spectral fingerprint methods for fast
identification of volcanic emissions and pollution, and determination
of the atmospheric carbon budget.

<H3>Along-track scanning radiometer (ATSR)</H3>

<P>We helped design the ATSR in conjunction with the Rutherford
Appleton Laboratory, the Met Office and the Mullard Space Science
Laboratory of University College, London. It was tested and calibrated
at Oxford, and launched on the ESA Remote-sensing Satellite ERS-1 in
July 1991. A second instrument, ATSR-2, also calibrated at Oxford, was
launched in 1995. Aerosol and cloud properties are being retrieved
from 7 years of ATSR-2 data as part of the NERC project GRAPE. The
ATSR mission was extended in 2002 with the launch of the Advanced ATSR
on Envisat; current studies are exploiting the four additional
channels on AATSR to improve the accuracy of retrieved atmospheric
properties.

<A NAME="2"><H2>2 Space experiments for observing the planets</H2></A>
<P><I>S B Calcutt, P G J Irwin, P L Read, F W Taylor</I>

<H3>Exploring Mercury from orbit</H3>

<P>Oxford scientists are part of the European Space Agency team
developing the BepiColombo' mission to the planet Mercury.  Our
role involves infrared radiometry to characterize the physical
properties of the surface and determine the nature of the icy deposits
at the poles.  We also aim to determine the heat flow from the
interior of the planet, which is expected to be anomalous since
Mercury has a substantial magnetic field and a very large and
partially liquid core.

<H3>European mission to study the atmosphere of Venus</H3>

<P>With colleagues in France and Germany we proposed the Venus Express
mission, which entered Venus orbit in April 2006 and will study Venus
from orbit for three years.  The main focus of the mission is to seek
to understand the climate on Venus, which is not at all what would be
expected by extrapolating from the Earth.  In particular, we will
study the nature of the global atmospheric circulation, the
atmospheric chemical composition and its variations,
surface-atmosphere physical and chemical interactions including
volcanism, the physics and chemistry of the cloud layer, the thermal
balance and role of trace gases in the greenhouse effect, and the
origin and evolution of the atmosphere.  Progress on these issues is
of crucial importance in a comparative-planetology context, notably
for understanding long-term climatic evolution processes on Earth-like
planets.

<H3>Lunar surface measurements</H3>

<P>The department is building, in collaboration with 
the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a near copy
of the Mars MCS instrument (below) called Diviner which will be
launched on the Lunar Reconnaisance Orbiter in 2008. This will measure
the thermal properties of the Lunar surface as well as investigating
its petrology.

<H3>Surveying the climate of Mars</H3> 

<P>In September 2006 the department was successful in a third
attempt to deploy an infrared remote sounding instrument in orbit
around Mars.  Mars Climate Sounder (MCS) was launched in August 2005
on the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter.  This follows the loss of two
previous missions, Mars Observer in 1993 and Mars Climate Orbiter in
1999, which both carried the Pressure Modulator Infra-Red Radiometer
(PMIRR) on which MCS is based. The new MCS instrument will address the same
scientific goals, the measurement of temperature, dust and humidity
profiles on Mars over at least one seasonal cycle, but with a more
compact design using new technology.  One major use of the data from
MCS is in the testing of Martian atmospheric models, as described in
Section 5.  The models may in turn play a role in the analysis of
spacecraft data through assimilation techniques.

<H3>Aurora/Exomars Mars lander</H3>

<P>The department is involved in developing three of the proposed
experiments for Aurora Exomars. The meteorological station is being
proposed along with the Open University and will measure the
temperature profile, dust saltation, surface pressure and wind
profiles to allow us to investigate Martian boundary layer phenomena
such as dust lifting and water adsorption. The short period
seismometer, being developed in collaboration with Imperial College,
will determine if Mars has any seismic activity. The department is
also working with DLR Berlin to supply a 5m long instrumented tether
cable which connects a sub-surface "mole" to the lander.

<H3>Galileo mission to Jupiter</H3>

<P>We are part of a team that developed an imaging spectrometer to
map cloud structure and condensable species (water, ammonia and
phosphine) in Jupiter's atmosphere, as part of the Galileo mission.
Galileo arrived at Jupiter in 1995 and has returned
spectacular data including the first ever in situ measurements of the
Jovian atmosphere by the separate Galileo probe. The mission ended
(by design!) with Galileo crashing into Jupiter in September 2003.

<P>Sophisticated analysis of the NIMS Jupiter spectra, using
multiple-scattering radiative transfer models has revealed
major new findings on the abundance and variability of minor
constituents such as water vapour, and on the structure and
composition of the clouds.
Further analysis continues to reveal new detail of the spatial
variability of composition and cloud around such features as the Great
Red Spot, White Ovals and Belt/Zone boundaries.  A major source of
uncertainty in the analysis of the NIMS spectra is the current poor
knowledge of the complex refractive indices of ammonia ice, and other
Jovian cloud constituents such as ammonium hydrosulphide.  A
collaboration is thus currently under way with the Jet Propulsion
Laboratory to re-measure these in the laboratory under more
representative Jovian atmospheric conditions.  In addition work is in
progress to assess what effect non-spherical particle shapes might
have on the modelled spectra.

<H3>Cassini-CIRS experiment for Saturn and Titan atmospheres</H3>

<P>Our group built the cooler and focal plane assembly for the Composite
Infra-Red Spectrometer (CIRS), launched on the Cassini Saturn orbiter. 
Since its arrival in orbit about Saturn in July 2004, CIRS has been
investigating the chemistry, thermal structure and dynamics of the
atmospheres of Saturn and Titan. The science team, led by Goddard Space
Flight Center, also includes scientists from the USA, France and Germany.

<P>On its way to the Saturnian system Cassini made a fly-by manoeuvre past
Jupiter in December 2000. The use of cooled detectors allowed us to use a
much higher spectral resolution and smaller field of view than the similar
IRIS instruments which were flown on both Voyager spacecraft, and which led
to much of our current understanding of Jupiter's atmosphere. The small (273
microrad) CIRS field of view is necessary to allow us to make limb
observations of Saturn, but it also meant that our spatial resolution during
the Jupiter fly-by was comparable to Voyager in spite the larger distance
from the planet. Using these observations we have been able to map the
Jovian atmospheric temperature structure, as well as the abundances of
hydrocarbons, ammonia and phosphine (revealing the vertical wind structure).
In addition, we have been able to make new estimates of the isotopic ratios
of nitrogen and hydrogen and also to search for carbon dioxide remaining
after the Shoemaker-Levy collision. We are currently extending these studies
to the atmosphere of Saturn.

<P>In addition to studying the atmosphere of giant planets, Cassini's other
main aim was to study the atmosphere of Saturn's largest moon, Titan. Titan
is the only moon in our solar system with a substantial atmosphere and the
photochemical processes currently taking place there are similar in many
ways to those which are thought to have occurred in the early terrestrial
atmosphere. Using the CIRS data we have been mapping the atmospheric
temperatures and also the abundances of hydrocarbons and nitriles, such as
HCN, and investigating the role that Titan's polar vortex plays in the
production and destruction of these gases. In addition, we have been
investigating the spatial distribution and spectral properties of Titan's
photochemically produced hazes and have also been studying the abundances of
oxygen-bearing species, such as carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide, which
are thought to arrive mainly though the ablation of micrometeorites.

<H3>Rosetta comet rendezvous</H3>

<P>Oxford is part of a consortium (with groups in Rome, Paris and
Berlin) selected by ESA to develop a spectroscopic experiment to study
the nucleus and core of a comet as part of its comet rendezvous
mission, Rosetta.  The mission was launched in March 2004 on an Ariane
5 rocket and Rosetta will rendezvous with Comet Churyumov-Garasimenko
in 2014.

<A NAME="3"><H2>3 Climate dynamics</H2></A>
<P><I>M R Allen</I>

<P> The Climate Dynamics group studies the large-scale behaviour of
the atmosphere-ocean system and how it responds to external drivers
such as the increases in greenhouse gas levels responsible for
anthropogenic climate change. At present, this large-scale response to
external forcing appears to be remarkably simple and predictable in
even the most complex climate models, despite the chaotic and
unpredictable behaviour of many of their individual components. We are
interested in understanding the origins of this .emergent simplicity'
and assessing the extent to which we should expect it to be shared by
the real world. The ultimate objective is to understand the physical
constraints on the large-scale climate system in order to place bounds
on future climate change.

<P>We are interested in timescales of years to centuries, much longer
than the limits of predictability of atmospheric weather systems. Much
of our research therefore focuses on how the statistics of atmospheric
and oceanic .weather noise' interact with more slowly-evolving aspects
of the system, such as the large-scale ocean circulation. On the
technical side, therefore, we are interested in the behaviour of
random and chaotic systems and particularly methods of model-data
comparison in systems supporting widely disparate timescales. Most of
our work is carried out in close collaboration with the Met Office's
Hadley Centre for Climate Prediction and Research and we also have
very close links with the Atmospheric Sciences Division of the
Rutherford Appleton Laboratory.

<P>Specific current projects include: quantitative attribution of
recent climate change, work which has been fed into the Third and
Fourth Assessment Reports of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate
Change (IPCC); exploiting the emerging signal of anthropogenic climate
change to quantify uncertainty in multi-decade climate forecasting;
ensemble techniques for probabilistic climate forecasting; interannual
climate predictability, concerning the mechanisms responsible for the
maintenance and decay of predictability in the atmosphere-ocean system
on seasonal to interannual timescales, particularly in mid-latitudes.

<P>In collaboration with the Open University, the Rutherford Appleton
Laboratory, the University of Reading and the Met Office, as well as
Tessella Scientific Software Solutions, the <A
HREF="http://climateprediction.net">climate<I>prediction</I>.net</A>
project was launched to the public in September 2003 and in February
2006 an experiment to simulate 1920-2080 was launched in conjunction
with the BBC's Climate Change season. By distributing tens of
thousands of unique versions of the Met Office climate model, HadCM3,
to the general public worldwide to run on their home, school and work
computers, the group has produced the most complete probability-based
forecasts of 21st century climate to date. The experiment investigates
the uncertainties inherent in climate models, due to the uncertainties
in model parameterisation schemes and initial conditions. Different
scenarios for future greenhouse gas emissions, volcanic activity, etc
are also being investigated. The results of the project will give
policy makers a more complete scientific base for planning to deal
with the consequences of climate change.

<A NAME="4"><H2>4 Modelling of the Earth's atmosphere</H2></A>
<P><I>D G Andrews</I>

<P>We use a range of computer models of the atmosphere, in
conjunction with a wide variety of data sets (including the
sub-department's large data sets on the stratosphere and mesosphere),
to help understand the dynamics and physics of the observed
troposphere, stratosphere and mesosphere, thus leading to an improved
understanding of the processes which influence weather and climate.

<P>Our modelling work is in collaboration with the Centre for Global
Atmospheric Modelling at Reading University, the Rutherford Appleton
Laboratory, the Met Office, and other groups. Some of the models we
use are quite simple, while others include very detailed
representations of fluid dynamics, radiative processes and chemical
transport.

<P>We are currently studying several aspects of the large-scale
atmospheric circulation, including the processes responsible for the
variability of flow regimes in the winter stratosphere. We are also
using a high-resolution model to investigate the small-scale dynamics
of the lower stratosphere, so as to take advantage of new data from
HIRDLS and other instruments. We have long-standing interests in
atmospheric wave motions, which play a crucial role in many of these
processes.

<A NAME="5"><H2>5 Atmospheric modelling of other planets</H2></A>
<P><I>P L Read</I>

<P>In parallel with our involvement in observations of Venus, Mars,
Jupiter and Saturn, we are actively modelling dynamical processes
relevant to phenomena in the atmospheres of the terrestrial and major
planets, with particular emphasis at present on the atmospheres of
Mars, Venus, Jupiter and Saturn.  Such studies are needed for the
interpretation of existing and future data (e.g. from NASA's Galileo
and Cassini missions, the Mars programmes and Venus Express, see
section 2).  They also help in the planning of new observational
programmes.  Current activities include the detailed simulation of the
atmospheric circulation and climate of Mars, assimilation of new
observations of Mars and the development of simpler process models of
large-scale jets and eddies on Jupiter and Saturn.  We have extended
the range of planets modelled to include Venus, following the
development path of the Martian GCM, but for an even more challenging
atmosphere.  Finally, our range of models now includes an Earth GCM,
used for the investigation of possible terrestrial paleoclimate
regimes in the distant past, e.g. frozen, Snowball Earth' states.

<P>The Mars General Circulation Model, developed in collaboration with
the Laboratoire de Météorologie Dynamique in Paris, attempts to
include the main variables which govern the Martian weather and
climate system.  Discrepancies with observations will reveal new
processes at work, or an incomplete understanding of the old ones.
Benefits of this work, in addition to a better scientific
understanding of the physics of atmospheres, will be prediction of
climatic conditions which may affect future landings and the possible
location of water reservoirs on Mars.  A fully-tested climate model
for modern Mars also provides a starting point for understanding how
the planet may have changed from a warm, wet past to the present
austere desert-like conditions.  On shorter timescales there is
evidence of less dramatic climate change, in the form of polar layered
terrains, and the model is being used to begin to investigate the
processes which may give rise to this.

<P>Until the recent advent of mapping phase data from the Mars Global
Surveyor (MGS) mission, atmospheric data from Mars lacked both spatial
and temporal coverage.  New remotely sensed observations have already
greatly extended this coverage, both spatially and over the seasonal
cycle.  Atmospheric sounders only allow the retrieval of certain
variables, such as temperature over a limited altitude range, and GCMs
will be of great use in the analysis and interpretation of such data,
both through direct comparison and more sophisticated data
assimilation techniques.  More than two full Martian years (around
four Earth years) of MGS thermal observations have already been
routinely assimilated into the Oxford Mars GCM to provide a unique
record of the Martian atmosphere over this period.  Carefully
validated GCMs also provide the best means of predicting the Martian
mean climate and its variability in regions, or for atmospheric
variables where few, if any, observations exist.

<P>Developments with the Mars GCM have included raising the top of the
model to the lower thermosphere (above 120 km), the inclusion of
detailed modelling of the processes of dust lifting, advection and
deposition (see the example of a simulated dust storm in the figure)
and the inclusion of processes needed to model the modern-day Martian
water cycle.

</TD></TR></TABLE>

<P>A numerical model is under development to enable simulation of the
circulation of the upper tropospheres and stratospheres of Jupiter and
Saturn.  This model is derived from the Met Office's Unified Model of
the Earth's atmosphere, which has been employed for both operational
weather forecasting and climate research, with the aim of including
realistic representations of a range of physical processes in order to
improve our understanding of the role of various dynamical phenomena
and thermodynamical processes on the large-scale circulations of the
gas giant planets.  So far, the model has primarily been used to
investigate the basic mechanisms that support the complex yet coherent
structures of the observed Jovian winds such as the Great Red Spot,
White Ovals and alternate multiple jets.  The resulting model will
eventually be capable of comparatively realistic simulation of
atmospheric circulations, and will ultimately be of great value in the
interpretation of current and future observations of Jupiter and
Saturn, e.g. from the Galileo and Cassini missions.

<A NAME="6"><H2>6 Laboratory fluid dynamics</H2></A>
<P><I>P L Read</I>

<P>We use laboratory systems and a complementary range of numerical
models to study the behaviour of circulations and instabilities
relevant to oceanic and atmospheric flows.  Experiments are typically
carried out in rotating containers with either differential heating or
mechanical forcing, to obtain analogues of large-scale circulations in
atmospheres and oceans.  The laboratory systems provide a means of
studying geophysically-relevant dynamical processes under controlled
conditions, both in their own right and as test beds for ideas and
techniques applicable to the interpretation and simulation of
atmospheric and oceanic phenomena.

<P>Recent projects have investigated the highly nonlinear development
of baroclinic and barotropic instabilities (which are responsible for
the formation of large-scale weather systems on the Earth, Mars and
other planets), their effects on the transport of heat, momentum and
other tracers, their influence on the predictability of the flow, and
the ability of numerical modelling techniques to simulate their
behaviour.  These instabilities exhibit a wide variety of routes to
chaotic behaviour and geostrophic turbulence, and we are leaders in
the application of ideas and techniques from dynamical systems theory
to the analysis, interpretation and modelling of flows in experimental
systems.

<P>Current and future studies are being directed towards investigating
the nonlinear effects of time-varying boundary conditions (analogous
to the effects of seasonal and other cycles in external forcing on the
Earth's climate) on baroclinic circulations, and mechanisms for the
breakdown of spatially-ordered flows from chaotic behaviour to
fully-developed turbulence - arguably one of the last great
unsolved problems of classical physics.
