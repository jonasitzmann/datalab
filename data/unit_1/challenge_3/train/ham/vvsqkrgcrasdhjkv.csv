<h2 align=center>NEWS FROM THE NET</h2>
<p>

<strong>GIOSEFFO ZARLINO'S MUSIC TREATISES</strong><br>

The Department of Computer and Humanities (Utrecht University)

announces the publication of Gioseffo Zarlino's Music Treatises,

facsimile and transcription edited by Frans Wiering, Thesaurus

Musicarum Italicarum, Volume 1, CD-ROM for Windows 95.

<p>

Gioseffo Zarlino (1517-1590) was one of the most influential music

theorists of the Renaissance. His principal work, <cite>Le istitutioni

harmoniche</cite>, is a unique synthesis of the music theory of Antiquity,

the Middle Ages and the Renaissance, and the compositional practice

of his own time. The <cite>Dimostrationi harmoniche</cite> presents music theory

according to the axiomatic model of Euclid's <cite>Elements</cite>. In the

<cite>Sopplimenti</cite>, Zarlino displays his wide reading of classical sources

in a sharp response to Vincenzo Galilei's critique of his earlier

writings.

<p>

This CD-ROM contains the first edition of the <cite>Istitutioni</cite> (1558),

and all three treatises as they appear in the <cite>Tutte le Opere</cite> of

1588-89. Each document is available in two forms: a facsimile and a

transcription. The texts are transcribed using Standard Generalized

Markup Language (SGML), following the guidelines of the Text Encoding

Initiative (TEI). All illustrations are included, and the music

examples from both editions of the <cite>Istitutioni</cite> have been

transcribed into modern notation. Longer examples from the 1558

edition can also be played from MIDI.

<p>

The CD-ROM also contains an SGML viewer for Windows 95, a viewer for

the facsimiles, and two fonts. Together these provide a powerful and

user-friendly software environment for the TMI.

<p>

The price of the CD-ROM is 10 Dollars, 6 British Pounds [BARGAIN],

LIT. 20,000, DM 20 or DFL 20 (cost of software, CD production and

mailing). To order, please send this amount IN CASH to the address

below. If you prefer to pay by cheque, please DOUBLE the specified

sums in order to cover the banking charges we shall unavoidably

incur.

<strong>WORLD SHAKESPEARE BIBLIOGRAPHY CD</strong><br>

Cambridge University Press has just released the World Shakespeare

several thousand additional reviews) cover scholarship and

productions in more than 80 languages. Full details are available at

the World Shakespeare Bibliography Web-Site:

<a href=http://www-english.tamu.edu/wsb/>http://www-english.tamu.edu/wsb/</a>  (which includes a list of books and articles that have not been tracked down).

<strong>IHR</strong><br>

CERES strongly recommends the Institute of Historical Research's pages at

<a href=http://ihr.sas.ac.uk/ihr/ihr0101.html> http://ihr.sas.ac.uk/ihr/ihr0101.html</a>.  The IHR provides links to on-line resources for historians on separate pages for London, the U.K., Europe, and world-wide. So from the London list one can take a trip to the PRO via <a href=http://ihr.sas.ac.uk/ihr/source.lon.html> http://ihr.sas.ac.uk/ihr/source.lon.html</a> or <a href=http://www.pro.gov.uk> http://www.pro.gov.uk</a>.

The Historical Manuscripts Commission is also accessible at <a href=http://www.hmc.gov.uk/> http://www.hmc.gov.uk/</a>. 

<p>

<strong>THE NATIONAL REGISTER OF ARCHIVES AT HMC</strong><br>

The <a href=http://www.hmc.gov.uk/nra/nra.html>NRA (http://www.hmc.gov.uk/nra/nra.html)</a> is a computerised database of information on the nature and locations of manuscript sources for British history. The information is

taken from nearly 40,000 catalogues of manuscript collections as well as

published guides to collections and from the HMC's own correspondence with

owners and custodians of manuscripts. If you have a telnet program running

underneath your web browser, you can access the NRA directly from the web

page. Otherwise, telnet to public.hmc.gov.uk; log in as 'public'; easy

search methods include personal and family names, corporate names, place

names, and location of records.

<p>

<strong>AEMILIA LANYER WEB SITE</strong><br>

A useful site, perfect for students or your own hasty preparations,

providing a full biography, comprehensive bibliography, text of the poems,

and support for the Lanyer Listserv (see also the CERES Starter Guide):

<a href=http://www.u.arizona.edu/~kari/lanyer.htm> http://www.u.arizona.edu/~kari/lanyer.htm</a>.

<p>

<strong>VERSIFICATION</strong><br>

An interdisciplinary journal of research in literary prosody.  

'Versification is a refereed electronic journal dedicated to advancing

interdisciplinary research into literary prosody. Versification publishes

material relevant to the study of prosody in all its many-faceted complexity

and provides an international forum for scholars, students, critics and

writers from many different fields to explore the role of sound in poetry.'

The current issue is 1.1, and a reference archive of introductory material

is in the making. Versification is at <a href=http://sizcol1.u-shizuoka-ken.ac.jp/versif/Versification.html> http://sizcol1.u-shizuoka-ken.ac.jp/versif/Versification.html</a>.

<p>
It already hosts T.V.F. Brogan's 'English Versification: A Reference Guide', a revised and corrected electronic

edition of Brogan's monumental annotated bibliography, Versification:

1570-1980, originally published by Johns Hopkins U.P. It will be

issued in individual files that correspond to the citation prefixes

in the Table of Contents. When the entire bibliography has been

published [and most of it seems to be there already], it will be

consolidated into a single file and a search engine added to

facilitate searches. This should be completed by early next year.

Later supplements, scheduled for 1998, will carry the bibliography's

terminus ad quem to 1987.
<p>

<strong>SHARP WEB</strong><br>

The website for the Society for the History of Authorship, Reading &

Publishing provides a rich set of links to bookish places, and support for

SHARP conferences, past and impending: <a href=http://www.indiana.edu/~sharp/> http://www.indiana.edu/~sharp/</a>.

<p>

<strong>COMPUTERS AND TEXTS</strong><br>

Computers & Texts 14 is now available on-line. Computers & Texts is the

journal/newsletter of CTI Textual Studies. The issue includes a review of

LION (Literature on-line) by Don Fowler.

<strong>SHAKESPEARE DOCUMENTS</strong><br>

A [purportedly] complete list of documentary evidence concerning the actor

William Shakspere is at: <a href=http://fly.hiwaay.net/~paul/positive.html> http://fly.hiwaay.net/~paul/positive.html</a>.  It has pictures of the documents. This is part of a Baconian site whose name does not bear repeating, but is 'Shake'n'Bacon'.

<p>

<strong>SHAKESPEARE WEB</strong><br>

If you want more Shakespeare links, try <a href=http://199.233.193.1/shakes.html#shakes> http://199.233.193.1/shakes.html#shakes</a>.  But you don't.

<p>

<p>

<strong>FRENCH PALAEOGRAPHY COURSE</strong><br>

Perhaps covering dates slightly late for some CERES members; but not for

others. And who would want to miss any on-line palaeography course, complete

with exams? The 13 lessons are archived at

<a href=http://www.mygale.org/07/voirin/paleo/html/sommaire.html> http://www.mygale.org/07/voirin/paleo/html/sommaire.html</a>.

<p>

<strong>MARLOWE ON-LINE</strong><br>

The Perseus Project at Tufts University (which already boasts impressive

classical materials) has released the first part of a freely available

electronic version of Christopher Marlowe's Complete Works on the web at:

<a href=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/Texts/Marlowe.html> http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/Texts/Marlowe.html</a>.

<p>

This site now provides users with the capacity to view various Dr Faustus

materials: the original 1604 text, known as the A text, as well as the

original 1616 text, the B text, alongside modernized versions of each. In

addition, the site displays the links between the A and B texts side by side

for comparison. The source text, The English Faust Book, is entered in its

entirety and can be viewed as such, or it can be viewed alongside the A or B

text where similar portions of each have been linked to one another. There

are also scholarly notes and glosses in the form of hypertextual links in

the English Faust Book. Eventually, a modernized version of the source text

will be entered as well. In addition, the textual variants for Doctor

Faustus and for all of Marlowe's other works will be entered, allowing users

to select which variant version of either the A or B text or of the various

historical collations they would like to read from. Soon the rest of

Marlowe's works, including translations, will have received similar treatment.

<p>

<strong>ZWINGLIAN REFORMATION BIBLIOGRAPHY</strong><br>

The annual bibliography 'Neue Literatur zur zwinglischen Reformation' is

available not only in printed form (in the yearbook 'Zwingliana'), but also

on the net. URL: <a href=http://www.unizh.ch/irg/biblio.html> http://www.unizh.ch/irg/biblio.html</a>.

<p>

<strong>SHAKESPEARE AND ASTROLOGY</strong><br>

A site exploring how examining Shakespeare's interest in astrology may

provide answers to problems of dating, textual variants, etc. With

particular ref. to Titus Andronicus, Winter's Tale, Antony and Cleopatra,

and Hamlet. The URL is: <a href=http://www.sonnet.co.uk/egma/> http://www.sonnet.co.uk/egma/</a>.

<p>

<strong>WORLD SHAKESPEARE BIBLIO ON CD-ROM</strong><br>

It must be good because it has just been awarded the Besterman Medal, given

by the Library Association (UK) for the year's outstanding bibliography.

This is the first time it has been awarded to an electronic publication.

Full details are available at the World Shakespeare Bibliography website:

<strong>CRRS (TORONTO) AND FICINO HOMEPAGE</strong><br>

CERES has mentioned the impressive list of resources at the Centre for

Reformation and Renaissance Studies site already. But anywhere with a

picture of a bookwheel can't be mentioned enough:

<a href=http://citd.scar.utoronto.ca/crrs/index.html> http://citd.scar.utoronto.ca/crrs/index.html</a>.  

It also gets a mention now because we can finally tell you where the

homepage of the FICINO discussion group (sponsored by CRRS) is...

<a href=http://citd.scar.utoronto.ca/CRRS/FICINO.html> http://citd.scar.utoronto.ca/CRRS/FICINO.html</a>.

<p>

<strong>CHAPMAN'S ODYSSEY</strong><br>

Project Bartleby at Columbia has one Renaissance text on its list, the 1857

edition of Chapman's Odyssey. Useful, and very nice-looking. URL:

<a href=http://www.columbia.edu/acis/bartleby/chapman/> http://www.columbia.edu/acis/bartleby/chapman/</a>.

<p>

<strong>COMPUTER & LETTEREN (UTRECHT)</strong><br>

The intimidatingly-titled Competence Center for Electronic Document

Engineering has an impressively businesslike and serious site with various

multimedia projects, including emblems, Dutch printers' devices, an

iconographic database, etc. This definitely merits a serious look-through by

a bibliographer, and CERES would be glad to hear of anyone's experiences:

<a href=http://candl.let.ruu.nl/> http://candl.let.ruu.nl/</a>.

<p>

<strong>BIBLIOTHECA AUGUSTANA</strong><br>

Another rather splendid classical website, the incipient Bibliotheca

Augustana is run by Ulrich Harsch, and is devoted to making Latin texts

(ancient, medieval, post-medieval) freely available in electronic form. At

present it includes works by Ambrosius, Boethius,

Comenius, Copernicus, Dante, Descartes, Einhard, Hrotsvitha of Gandersheim,

Isidore, Lactantius, Melanchthon, Morus, Cornelius Nepos, Spinoza,

Theophilus presbyter, Ulfilas and Vergil, and several more are planned

(Caesar, Catullus, Cicero, Diocletianus, Donatus, Francesco of Assisi,

Horace, Livius, Lucrece, Ovid, Petrarca, Sallust, Tacitus). Wot fine lists.

<a href=http://www.fh-augsburg.de/~harsch/augusta.html> http://www.fh-augsburg.de/~harsch/augusta.html</a>.

<p>

For those interested in Dante, the Bibliotheca offers e-texts of the

<cite>Quaestio de acqua et terra</cite>, of the two <cite>Eclogues</cite>, and of <cite>Epistola III</cite> (and a new HTML version of Jim Marchand's e-text of <cite>Epistola XIII</cite>); <cite>De vulgari

eloquentia</cite> will be available shortly.

<p>

<strong>EARLY MODERN LITERARY STUDIES NEW ISSUE</strong><br>

This has finally appeared, heralded by a mighty apologia cross-posted to

many lists CERES members subscribe to. For those who depend only on us,

issue 3.1 is at <a href=http://purl.oclc.org/emls/emlshome.html> http://purl.oclc.org/emls/emlshome.html</a>.  Or the U.K. mirror:

<a href=http://users.ox.ac.uk/~emls/emlshome.html> http://users.ox.ac.uk/~emls/emlshome.html</a>.  The issue includes Steve Sohmer on "12 June 1599: Opening Day at Shakespeare's Globe", Randall Martin on "Isabella Whitney's 'Lamentation upon the death of William Gruffith'", Emma Roth-Schwartz on "Colon and Semi-Colon in Donne's Prose Letters: Practice and Principle", and Jeffrey Kahan on a possible source for Caliban, as well as a host of reviews.

Included alongside issue 3.1 is the first in the EMLS Special Issue Series,

edited by Ian Lancashire and Michael Best, and entitled <cite>New Scholarship

from Old Renaissance Dictionaries: Applications of the Early Modern English

Dictionaries Database</cite>.

<p>

<strong>COPAC UPDATE</strong><br>

COPAC is an internationally accessible catalogue giving unified free access

to some of the largest university research library collections in the UK and

Ireland. A *new release* of COPAC has just been made available containing a

number of changes such as new libraries (incl. The University of London

Library), more local data, and extended search facilities. To access COPAC

you can use the Web Interface at: <a href=http://copac.ac.uk/copac/> http://copac.ac.uk/copac/</a>.  Or the Text Interface using telnet:  <a href=telnet:copac.ac.uk>telnet copac.ac.uk</a>. Username and password are both 'copac'.

<strong>CESARE RIPA'S <cite>ICONOLOGIA</cite></strong><br>

The ORBIS Foundation (the Hungarian centre for computer applications in art

history) is preparing an annotated CD-Rom edition of Cesare Ripa's

<cite>Iconologia</cite>. The first issue (to be published in December 1997) will

comprise: the full text of eight Italian editions of the Iconologia and

every illustration (c. 150 - 400 engravings per edition); a critical

comparison of the Italian editions with notes on textual variants;

comprehensive annotations; the full Hungarian translation of the first

illustrated edition of 1603, with Hungarian footnotes; two English versions

(the full text of the 1709 London edition, and the full text of a hitherto

unpublished 17th century English translation in manuscript (British Library,

MS Add. 23195); an iconographic index on the basis of the ICONCLASS

international iconographic descriptive system; and the full text of all the

cited sources. It will also contain the full text of a number of sources

used by Ripa, including works by Boccaccio, Comes, and Dante.

<p>

Further information and a sample (the article on Avaritia) can be found at

<a href=http://vega.ceu.hu:80/medstud/or/ripa.htm> http://vega.ceu.hu:80/medstud/or/ripa.htm</a>.

<p>

The hypertexts of Ripa's sources will be made freely available on the web;

the first of these texts, Pietro Vasolli da Fivizano's Italian translation

<strong>CAMBRIDGE ENGLISH FACULTY WEBSITE</strong><br>

Well, we could hardly fail to mention this could we? All Colin Burrow's own

work, it will soon include all course reading lists online - accessible only

from within cam.ac.uk - and already contains information on the Faculty's

teaching staff, under- and post-graduate courses, and a cute 'House of Fame'

history of Cambridge critics, all of which is accessible to anyone who wants

to know. Long overdue.  Find it at <a href=http://www.english.cam.ac.uk/> http://www.english.cam.ac.uk/</a>.

<strong>INTERNET LIBRARY OF EARLY JOURNALS</strong><br>

The ULs of Birmingham, Leeds, Manchester and Oxford are engaged in the ILEJ

project, which aims to provide Internet access to pages and indexes of the

following: Notes and Queries 1849-69, Blackwood's Magazine 1843- 63, The

Builder 1843-63, Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society 1758-78,

Gentleman's Magazine 1731-1831, The Annual Register 1758-78. Full-text

searching will be possible for some titles, although most pages will be

available as scanned images. Notes and Queries is the first journal

available: twelve volumes 1849-55 are already up and running, with the rest

to follow soon. For information and participation details, e-mail <a href=mailto:tsl@bodley.ox.ac.uk>Thaddeus

<strong>HOBY'S CASTIGLIONE HTML TEXT</strong><br>

Richard Bear at the University of Oregon has produced a neat but

unspectacular HTML edition of Hoby's 1561 translation of <cite>The Courtier</cite>. Only

the title page is there in facsimile but the rest (taken from Raleigh's 1900

edition) is all present and (apparently) correct. Links help you navigate

from section to section, but this is not a multi-media project by any means.

<strong>GLOBE WEBSITES</strong><br>

Not surprisingly the Globe Project has spawned a good website based at

Reading. It includes a Virtual Reality tour of the Globe (which means some

Quicktime movie clips), and an archive of material on staging, with

information on performance at the Globe in both its incarnations. URL:

<a href=http://www.rdg.ac.uk/globe/>http://www.rdg.ac.uk/globe/</a>.

<p>

There's an American Globe website which offers less specifically Globe- ish

content and links to lots of acting and teaching on-line resources. Its URL

is <a href=http://www.shakespeare.uiuc.edu> http://www.shakespeare.uiuc.edu</a>. This will take you to the low-graphics version. If you have a good Internet connection (i.e. not a modem) and an up-to-date browser (Netscape or Explorer version 3) then you could go for the 'High Bandwith' option which has more graphics and frames etc. The URL for going straight there is <a href=http://www.shakespeare.uiuc.edu/frametop.html> http://www.shakespeare.uiuc.edu/frametop.html</a>.

<strong>BROTHERTON COLLECTION MANUSCRIPT VERSE</strong><br>

CERES is showing its age! We remember the days when this was a creaky

telnet link! (At least we think we do.) Can it be that haven't

mentioned this seriously scholarly internet search facility, enabling

you to rummage (virtually) through the individual items of English

poetry contained in the 17th and 18th century manuscripts in the

Brotherton Collection of Leeds University Library? No full texts, but

first and last lines and lots of bibliographical information. The

website expresses the hope that in time it may extend to include

material in other collections. Let's hope so. The items in question

range from contemporary copies of poems by writers like Dryden and

Pope at one literary extreme to popular tags and epitaphs at the

other. Many of the manuscripts are miscellanies and commonplace books

which have never previously been indexed, and their contents have

consequently remained largely unknown to scholars.

Pay respects to <a href=http://www.leeds.ac.uk/library/spcoll/bcmsv/intro.html> http://www.leeds.ac.uk/library/spcoll/bcmsv/intro.html</a>.

<strong>CHRIST CHURCH PICTURE GALLERY</strong><br>

Like most Oxbridge colleges Christ Church has a website, but its

details of exhibitions and reproductions from the Renaissance Italian

collection via <a href=http://www.chch.ox.ac.uk/> http://www.chch.ox.ac.uk/</a>.

<p>

<strong>THE GALILEO PROJECT</strong><br>

This site is dedicated to the life and work of Galileo and to the

science and scientists of his era. It offers a great deal of serious

information on a well-organised site. Amongst other things it has

fairly detailed biographies of some 600 major figures in European

Renaissance science: <a href=http://es.rice.edu/ES/humsoc/Galileo/> http://es.rice.edu/ES/humsoc/Galileo/</a>.

<strong>ELECTRONIC MARLOWE</strong><br>

CERES has already mentioned this site for its texts of Dr Faustus; it

is now on the verge of being complete, with an electronic edition of

the rest of Marlowe's works. This edition collates many earlier

editions of the plays: for instance, users may select the 1590 Octavo

version of Tamburlaine the Great, Part 1 or view instead Robinson's

1826 collation. By selecting from the pop-up menu above each text,

viewers may choose between approximately twenty versions of each of

Marlowe's works. It is anticipated that every text will be available

for viewing with textual variants any day now. Find it at

<strong>THE ELIOT-PHELIPS COLLECTION CATALOGUING PROJECT</strong><br>

The University of London Library has just completed the first phase

(funded by HEFCE) of a project to catalogue and conserve the

Eliot-Phelips Collection of publications printed in or relating to

Spain. The collection consists primarily of approximately 3500 books,

pamphlets, and official documents, supplemented by smaller numbers of

maps, manuscripts, and prints. Over 50% of the printed material is

from the hand-press period. Of the 971 items catalogued up to July

1997, 139 were printed before 1600, 195 between 1600 and 1699, and

213 between 1700 and 1830.

<p>

A fuller account of the project, together with a more detailed

description of the material in the collection, is now available on

the Web. It can be seen via the University of London Library home

page (URL: <a href=http://www.ull.ac.uk/ull/>http://www.ull.ac.uk/ull/</a>) or directly at URL: <a href=http://www.ull.ac.uk/ull/EP/EPIntro.html>http://www.ull.ac.uk/ull/EP/EPIntro.html</a>.

<strong>MR WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE AND THE INTERNET</strong><br>

This site has been around for a while but after its recent revision

it is a capacious and useful starting point not only for Shakespeare

resources but for Renaissance literature more generally. And, it has

<strong>COMPUTERS AND TEXTS ON-LINE</strong><br>

Volume 15 is now on-line! Of particular interest is Jean Chothia's

review of the Arden Shakespeare CD-ROM, with a response co-written by

Jonathan Bate. The central contention in the Computers and Texts review

is its use of the Arden 2 editions rather than the new Arden 3. URL

<strong>EMLS MAKES ITS MOVE; NEW ISSUE OUT NOW</strong><br>

EMLS (Early Modern Literary Studies) is an old favourite. It has been based

at the University of Alberta's Department of English since the September

1997 issue (3.2). All of which makes very little difference to

web-searchers since its permanent address (PURL) has stayed the same:

<a href=http://purl.oclc.org/emls/emlshome.html> http://purl.oclc.org/emls/emlshome.html</a>.  However, the contact addresses have changed, with various things now based at Alberta. So check out the website to make sure you get details right.  Oh, and issue 3.2 is ready for access: Articles by Dennis Kay, Chris Fitter, Victoria Burke and Elizabeth Clarke of the Perdita Project, and various reviews.

<strong>ONLINE TRANSLATOR</strong><br>

It's hard not to be excited by the thought of a web page which

can turn stilted English sentences into dazzling French, Italian,

Spanish, German, or Portuguese. Well, Altavista have exactly that

on their web site - a beta (trial) version of translation

software produced by the boffins at Systran.

<p>

There's a Press Release at <a href=http://altavista.digital.com/av/content/pr120997.htm> http://altavista.digital.com/av/content/pr120997.htm</a>. The Direct Translation Page is <a href=http://babelfish.altavista.digital.com/> http://babelfish.altavista.digital.com/</a>.

<p>

It doesn't yet seem to be available at any of Altavista's mirror

sites.

<p>

The service is cutely named after a creation of Douglas Adams's

Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy series.  The babelfish was a small

red fish which when placed in the outer ear would cause any speech

that passed through it to be translated into the language of the

ear's owner.  Altavista's service can deliver prose which looks a

bit like it's been swallowed by a red herring and has turned up on

your dinner plate, but it is a lot less ticklish than a fish in the

ear.

<p>

The facility is almost frighteningly good at humdrum epistolary

prose, such as you might want to send to French, German, Italian,

Portuguese, or Spanish libraries or academic institutions.  It

obviously can't cope with old spelling, so you will need to help it

out if you don't want some highly amusing creole to emerge:

<p>

Las! ne reverray-je plus ceste beaute parfaite,<br>

Donc me faudra il mourir sans esperer aucun secours?<br>

<cite>Mow! reverray I more ceste perfect beauty,<br>

Therefore will be necessary for me it to die without expecting any

help?</cite>

<p>

Like anything else working on one of today's mainframes, the

service operates at a speed you will not believe.  We have seen the

future and it employments.

<h3 align=center>INTRODUCTION, GENERAL IDEAS</h3>

Because the World-Wide Web can offer sounds and images in support of text,

the next few years will probably see a proliferation of multi-media

extravaganzas. Expect Comus to leap off the screen at you in a year or two,

and eventually an animated Inigo Jones sketch to twirl before your eyes as

Michael Chance sings Ferrabosco's setting of a Jonson masque number. Already

record companies seem to have leapt on to the Web, so AltaVista searches on

names like Dowland and Marenzio will throw up dozens of blurbs for CDs.

Individual musicians have a strong web presence also, partly because many

musicians were seduced into computer literacy a long time ago by the

advantages of MIDI interfaces, enabling, for instance, musical notation to

be produced from a piano keyboard input, and multiple tracks/parts to be

played back. This does not concern us, but it is the sort of thing which

concerns a number of very good pages on the Web. Putting aside the

temptations of the Hurdy Gurdy Home Page, we can go straight to an example

of this, the extraordinary pages of the Finnish lutenist Arto Wickla at

<a href=http://www.cs.helsinki.fi/~wikla/music.html>http://www.cs.helsinki.fi/~wikla/music.html</a>.  This includes probably the best set of early music links, and plenty of

examples of pages with pretty tunes for those with sound cards.

<p>

The Cambridge Music Faculty recommends a start at one of two places: <a href=http://www.sun.rhbnc.ac.uk/Music/Links/>Royal

Holloway and Bedford</a> and <a href=http://musdra.ucdavis.edu/Documents/AMS/musicology_www.html>The American Musicological Society</a>.  Royal Holloway's pages are a very rich though haphazard set of humanities links with a musical skew; the AMS pages are rather less chaotic, and very comprehensive.

<p>

Other fairly good links are at:
<ul>
<li><a href=http://toltec.lib.utk.edu/~music/wwwclas.html>http://toltec.lib.utk.edu/~music/wwwclas.html</a><br>

The serious stuff, though (and please let us know if we're missing something

obvious), is limited...

<strong>RISM</strong><br>

The Repertoire International des Sources Musicales (International Inventory

of Musical Sources) represents a worldwide effort to identify and describe

sources of music and writings about music from the earliest times through

ca. 1825. The RISM Home Page is a joint production of the RISM

Zentralredaktion at Frankfurt/Main, Germany, and the U.S. RISM Office at

Harvard University Cambridge, Massachusetts, U.S.A. and is located at

<a href=http://www.rism.harvard.edu/RISM/>http://www.rism.harvard.edu/RISM/</a>.  

It hosts a number of databases, the directory to which is at

<a href=http://www.rism.harvard.edu/rism/DB.html>http://www.rism.harvard.edu/rism/DB.html</a>.  

Very useful and fully indexed is the database of music mss after 1600. Their

blurb: the RISM Series A/II Database contains bibliographic records for

music manuscripts written after ca. 1600 and, in most cases, before ca.

1850. Records include information in standard bibliographic categories as

well as graphical images of music incipits.

<p>

Others:<br>

The RISM-U.S. Libretto Database contains bibliographic records for more than

11,000 printed and manuscript libretti for musical stage pieces from the

earliest manifestations through the beginning of the twentieth century.

Presently included in the database are records for all libretti in the

Albert Schatz Collection at the Library of Congress.

The RISM Libraries Directory identifies more than 5,500 libraries world-wide

that hold music materials relevant to RISM series. All libraries are

identified by name and RISM siglum. Other information provided can include:

address, phone/fax numbers, links to relevant Internet resources, and

literature about the library.

The RISM Bibliographic Citations Database contains references for all

thematic catalogues and other secondary sources cited in the RISM A/II Music

Manuscripts Database and the RISM-US Libretto Database. The database can be

searched from hyperlinks in those databases, or directly from a database

search menu.

<strong>DOCTORAL DISSERTATIONS IN MUSICOLOGY ON-LINE</strong><br>

This is an excellent, and very comprehensive, searchable database, incorporating and continuing the American Musicological Society's published

listings: <a href=http://www.music.indiana.edu/ddm/>http://www.music.indiana.edu/ddm/</a>.  

<p>

<strong>UL MUSIC CATALOGUE</strong><br>

The new Cambridge University Library music catalogue contains ca. 12,000

entries for musical scores created since 1989, and includes nearly all music

manuscripts (except medieval liturgical and some other early mss). This is

its principal attraction. For instance, every one of the 239 intriguing

items in MS Dd.2.11 are separately entered, so the whole contents can be

browsed by a search on the classmark, and individual items can be pulled up

by their title. If you have a suspicion that there must be a number for

Willoughby, 'Willoughby's' in the title field will bring you 'My lord

Willougby's tune' from this ms. The catalogue can be browsed under 'other

catalogues' at <a href=telnet:ul.cam.ac.uk>ul.cam.ac.uk</a>.

<h3 align=center>OTHER COMPREHENSIVE SITES</h3>

<p>

<strong>SIXTEENTH-CENTURY PRINTED TABLATURES</strong><br>

This seems a very professional job. Its blurb: Sixteenth-century printed

tablatures for the lute, vihuela, guitar, and cittern is a site offering an

experimental database of printed tablatures for plucked-string instruments

from 1500-1599. It is primarily concerned with bibliographical information

relating to Lute, Vihuela, Guitar, and Cittern tablatures; it also contains

information on three lesser-known instruments: the Bandora, the Mandora, and

the Orpharion. Each section contains basic information regarding a specific

instrument: brief organological descriptions, explanations of tablature, and

links to more detailed bibliographical and biographical information. This is

an ongoing project; eventually, each book will be analysed as to contents

and individual incipits of the pieces (in tablature) will be placed in a

searchable thematic catalogue.  Visit this project at <a href=http://www.lib.duke.edu/music/lute/home.html>http://www.lib.duke.edu/music/lute/home.html</a>.

<p>

<strong>THE CLASSICAL MUSIC PAGES</strong><br>

This web site [tells you that it] provides you almost everything you need

concerning classical music - its history, biographical information about

composers (with portraits and short sound examples), explanations of the

various musical forms and a dictionary of musical terminologies.  Start at <a href=http://w3.rz-berlin.mpg.de/cmp/classmus.html>http://w3.rz-berlin.mpg.de/cmp/classmus.html</a>.   This is an ongoing project, but already it offers a fairly comprehensive set of extracts from the New Grove, with hypertextual links; certainly useful, if you really don't want to leave your desk.

<h3 align=center>LESS COMPREHENSIVE BUT STILL WORTH A LOOK</h3>

<p>

<strong>THESAURUS MUSICARUM ITALICARUM (TMI)</strong><br>

TMI is run by the impressive Computer & Letteren at Utrecht University. The aim of the project is to publish in hypertextual format a series of 16th and early 17th-century Italian music treatises, although it is still incipient. A very full prospectus is at

<a href=http://candl.let.ruu.nl/>http://candl.let.ruu.nl/</a>. 

<p>

<strong>THESAURUS MUSICARUM LATINARUM</strong>

This is a repository of Latin music theory texts,

considerably more advanced:  <a href=gopher://iubvm.ucs.indiana.edu/11/tml> gopher://iubvm.ucs.indiana.edu/11/tml</a>

<p>

<strong>LEXICON MUSICUM LATINUM</strong><br>

Prospectus for the printed volume, with

bibliography and links relating to Medieval music theory; a German site:

<a href=http://www.badw.de/musik/lml.htm> http://www.badw.de/musik/lml.htm</a>.

<p>

<strong>THEMA: (Music) THEory of the Middle Ages</strong><br>

At present, this database

comprises hypertext transcriptions of 18 manuscript copies of 14 Latin

theoretical treatises related to musica mensurabilis of the thirteenth

century. A little beyond our brief. <a href=http://www.uga.edu/~thema/> http://www.uga.edu/~thema/</a>.

<p>

<strong>GREG LINDAHL</strong><br>

Greg Lindahl has a personal but not unuseful set of pages, with an especial

liking for ballads and Thomas Ravenscroft; much is scanned in, so facsimiles

of entire volumes can be printed off.  For the main page, go to <a href=http://www.pbm.com/~lindahl/home.html>http://www.pbm.com/~lindahl/home.html</a>; for ballads, try <a href=http://www.pbm.com/~lindahl/ballads/ballads.html> http://www.pbm.com/~lindahl/ballads/ballads.html</a>. He provides an early music bibliography at <a href=http://www.pbm.com/~lindahl/articles/music_bibliography.html>http://www.pbm.com/~lindahl/articles/music_bibliography.html</a>.

<p>

<strong>JEFF LEE</strong><br>

Jeff Lee has a similar set of music pages, with MIDI files of Coprario's

'Funeral Teares' and links for lutenists: <a href=http://www.gate.net/~shipbrk/music.html>http://www.gate.net/~shipbrk/music.html</a>. His scary homepage includes a link to a fun set of 'rules for children to

write by' from 1611, with pictures of good and bad pen posture: <a href=http://www.gate.net/~shipbrk/>http://www.gate.net/~shipbrk/</a>.

<p>

<strong>HNH</strong><br>

HNH, the umbrella company for NAXOS, provides composer's biographies with

surveys of their output, as well as a glossary of musical terms, with links

to information on Naxos recordings. Information depends on a record being

there to support it, so there is no Ferrabosco or Eccles; the glossary is

limited: no 'melisma', but 'modal' is useful enough. Not bad despite the

filthy mercantilism: <a href=http://www.hnh.com/hnh.htm>http://www.hnh.com/hnh.htm</a>.

<p>

<strong>TRANSCRIBING AND READING WHITE MENSURAL NOTATION</strong><br>

A labour of love from another muso punter, this site gives a multimedia tutorial in Renaissance music notation from the mid-16th century: <a href=http://www.uconect.net/~raybro/index1.html>http://www.uconect.net/~raybro/index1.html</a>.

<strong>THE ENGLISH DANCING MASTER</strong><br>

A project to enter Playford's first edition

<p>

<strong>ENGLISH LUTE MANUSCRIPTS AND SCRIBES 1530-1630</strong><br>

One of the most impressive finds was the gobsmackingly vast 1994 Oxford

D.Phil. of Julia Craig-McFeely, ENGLISH LUTE MANUSCRIPTS AND SCRIBES

1530-1630, which one can download in its entirety, piece by piece, thanks to

the author's generosity. The files are under the aegis of a fellow lute

lover, who must have done the converting to html, no simple task:

<a href=http://www.cs.dartmouth.edu/~wbc/julia/>http://www.cs.dartmouth.edu/~wbc/julia/</a>.  It comes either in plain text or hypertext (with pictures). Try the

<p>

<strong>MEDIEVAL.ORG</strong><br>

Says little about itself but hosts a great deal of low-level

information, including Early Music frequently asked questions (FAQs), such

as 'what was the first opera?', the infinitely regressive equivalent of

'what was the first novel?'; the site also has links to huge amounts of

information on recordings, so a search on a composer will tend to take you

here: <a href=http://www.medieval.org/emfaq/>http://www.medieval.org/emfaq/</a>.

<p>

<strong>MUSICA BRITTANICA</strong><br>

This is usefully listed by its publishers at

<a href=http://www.stainer.co.uk/musica.htm> http://www.stainer.co.uk/musica.htm</a>.

<p>

For those interested in lyric poetry and song, there is no on-line Doughtie

or Fellowes, and the best thing in the meantime is to keep an eye on

<h3 align=center>ON-LINE JOURNALS</h3>

<p>

Again, one can start at Royal Holloway and Bedford's list of music journals:

<a href=http://www.sun.rhbnc.ac.uk/Music/Links/journals.html> http://www.sun.rhbnc.ac.uk/Music/Links/journals.html</a>.  Or go direct to

<a href=http://www.sscm.harvard.edu/jscm/Welcome.html> http://www.sscm.harvard.edu/jscm/Welcome.html</a>

for the <a href=http://www.sscm.harvard.edu/jscm/Welcome.html>JOURNAL OF SEVENTEENTH-CENTURY MUSIC</a>. JSCM is published by the

Society for Seventeenth-Century Music and provides a refereed forum for

scholarly studies of the musical cultures of the seventeenth century. These

include historical and archival studies, performance practice, music theory,

aesthetics, dance and theatre. The JSCM also publishes critical reviews and

summary listings of recently published books, scores, recordings, and

electronic media. The journal is still working out its full potential, but

already has hypertextual links within articles to illustrative examples,

both graphical and audio. Clearly the on-line music journal is better placed

than many WWW efforts to assert its superiority over traditional media.

<p>

The other place to go is MUSIC THEORY On-Line at

<a href=http://boethius.music.ucsb.edu/mto/mtohome.html> http://boethius.music.ucsb.edu/mto/mtohome.html</a>.   This is the organ of the Society for Music Theory, and offers articles, reviews, book anouncements, dissertation listings, etc. with a theoretical skew but with no restrictions of period, so I learnt from here of a dissertation on the background to Morley's 'Plain and Easy Introduction', and a new book on German musica poetica.

<h3 align=center>LISTS</h3>

<p>

A good list of lists, including med-and-ren-music and rendance

(details for both of which are in the CERES Starter Guide) at

<a href=http://www.medieval.org/emfaq/misc/lists.html> http://www.medieval.org/emfaq/misc/lists.html</a>.

<p>

EARLYM-L is worth a look. It is a very lively list, accommodating

performers, listeners, musicologists, and is archived at

gopher://olymp.wu-wien.ac.at/11/.earlym-l.  Its home page is:

<a href=http://www.wu-wien.ac.at/earlym-l/> http://www.wu-wien.ac.at/earlym-l/</a>.  Rather clearer information on subscription is at

<a href=http://www.medieval.org/emfaq/misc/earlym-l.html> http://www.medieval.org/emfaq/misc/earlym-l.html</a>.

<p>
<hr width=75% align=center>

<a name=software></a>

<h3 align=center>SOFTWARE FOR MUSICAL NOTATION</h3>

By far the best notational software is that written by William Clocksin, of

the Cambridge Computer Laboratory and Trinity Hall, and a lutenist. His

'Calliope' is specifically geared to the problems of early music, including

lute tablature. Information about 'Calliope', and a demonstration, at

<a href=http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/users/wfc/calliope.html> http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/users/wfc/calliope.html</a>.  

Unfortunately the software runs only on NeXTStep, a UNIX platform which may

be made the basis for the next generation of Apple Macintosh, so perhaps one

day...

<p>

In the meantime there are some very expensive applications which enable you

to play with MIDI synthesisers, but very little devoted solely and sensibly

to inputting text and notes. Some lists of software are available at: <a href=http://www.sun.rhbnc.ac.uk/Music/Links/software.html> http://www.sun.rhbnc.ac.uk/Music/Links/software.html</a> and <a href=http://www.users.dircon.co.uk/~ara/notation.htm> http://www.users.dircon.co.uk/~ara/notation.htm</a>. Better, though, is the CTI's page: <a href=http://www.lancs.ac.uk/users/music/research/sware.html> http://www.lancs.ac.uk/users/music/research/sware.html</a>.  

This will take you to free software like Muzikator and Mozart; these tend

either to crash or not to cope well with combining words and music (or even

with managing 2 notes vertically on one stave in one case), as 'Calliope'

does so beautifully, and as other less elegant but very expensive

applications can. So as yet none receives a recommendation.

<h2 align=center>ENGLISH RENAISSANCE BUILDINGS</h2>

<p>

CERES enters the world of virtual tourism!

<p>

One of the results of the Internet's world-shrinking capacity is the

greater availability of information about, and pictures of, beautiful

and interesting places. It happens that some of England's palaces and

country houses are very well-served by web pages. So CERES decided it

would be a good idea to undertake a characteristically obsessive

search.

<p>

The pages below offer one or more of the following: 

<ol type=i>

<li>pictures - the idea being, that the Internet offers an effective way of

accompanying reading with a visual image 

<li>historical and architectural information - often this is at a low level, but

sometimes the barest facts can be very useful

<li>banal details like when the buildings are open, how much entry costs, etc. - CERES is not wholly against real life and actually visiting places.

</ol>

<p>

The priority in what follows is not so much to cover every country

house or palace, but rather to find Internet materials relating to

them. If you have suggestions (either for websites not included, or

names which could be searched), then do get in touch. Typing a name

into an Altavista seach will often take you to the right place,

although you could always find yourself on a photo-tour of a Bed and

Breakfast.

<p>

One thing CERES should not mention is a site which invites you to

enter your name and find out if you could be related to stately

home-owners. They'll sell you a picture of 'your' house if you don't

keep your wits about you: <a href=http://www.infokey.com/hon/caslist.htm> http://www.infokey.com/hon/caslist.htm</a>.  Actually there may in some bizarre way be an academic use for this, but...

<h3 align=center>GENERAL ARCHITECTURAL</h3>

<p>

<strong>AN UNSPEAKABLY EXCELLENT SITE</strong><br>

Professor Hugh Lester of Tulane University, CERES salutes you!  His site 'Period and Style for Designers' is at <a href=http://www.tulane.edu/lester/text/lester.html> http://www.tulane.edu/lester/text/lester.html</a>.  It is a gem: carefully chosen, concisely described, clearly presented pictures of a remarkable diversity of materials. The 'English Renaissance' and 'English Baroque' areas are most directly within the

remit of CERES, but all the sections are good. Check out building

exteriors and interiors, and furniture and objects as well, from the

Pyramids to Frank Lloyd Wright.

<p>

<strong>SCAFFOLD - WWW ARCHITECTURAL SITE</strong><br>

Currently under construction (appropriately enough), with only some

images and text in place: so far Indian architecture, Vitruvius, and

Renaissance Italians are represented, plus some general architectural

materials. Head for<a href=http://ccat.sas.upenn.edu/george/scaffold.html> http://ccat.sas.upenn.edu/george/scaffold.html</a>.

<p>

<strong>RUBENS PROJECT</strong><br>

If you are interested in viewing and downloading architectural and

artistic images on a large scale then this Australian project run

from ANU will be of interest. Using secure servers, registration, and

(to access its full glory) payment, it is a pretty major undertaking.

Head for <a href=http://rubens.anu.edu.au/>http://rubens.anu.edu.au/</a> and find out more. CERES found

that Netscape and Internet Explorer were not entirely happy with the

secure server set-up and did not load some pages. From the outside it

looked like perseverance would be worthwhile.

<p>

<strong>VOICE OF THE SHUTTLE ARCHITECTURE PAGE</strong><br>

<strong>WELCOME TO BRITAIN!</strong><br>

phrase!) are: <a href=http://www.britain.co.uk/> http://www.britain.co.uk/</a>.

<p>

<strong>AND FINALLY</strong><br>

A gentleman from Finland by the name of Risto Hurmalainen has created

a list of, with links to, his 100 favourite old British buildings.

Many a treasure hides therein: <a href=http://www.dlc.fi/~hurmari/castles.html> http://www.dlc.fi/~hurmari/castles.html</a>.

<strong>HURRAH!</strong><br>

Naturally some of the best buildings and artworks are owned by our

dear Royal family. Although Earl Spencer tells us they are

old-fashioned, in fact they have a far better website than he does,

with plenty of palace(s) information at <a href=http://www.royal.gov.uk/> http://www.royal.gov.uk/</a>.

<p>

<strong>BURGHLEY HOUSE, LINCS</strong><br>

Thanks in part to Stamford's claim to be the 'finest Stone Town on

the Internet' Burghley House has a healthy web presence. Lose no time

in zapping to <a href=http://www.stamford.co.uk/burghley/index.html> http://www.stamford.co.uk/burghley/index.html</a>.  

There is some historical information but not surprisingly the main

pleasure of this site are the pictures of house, grounds, furniture,

of the excellent art collection, and of the extraordinary Heaven Room

and Hell Staircase painted by Antonio Verrio. Actually the

reproduction of the latter is disappointing.

<p>

You can reach a slightly better Hell Staircase via the Burghley House page at <a href=http://www.demon.co.uk/citygate/> http://www.demon.co.uk/citygate/</a>.

There's a little more detail about the building of Burghley here.

<p>

But it gets better! The Italian paintings from Burghley went on tour

in 1996 and the result is a superb virtual art gallery with nice

reproductions and interpretive notes under the auspices of the the

Lakeview Museum in Peoria, Illinois. Don't miss

<strong>CASTLE HOWARD, YORKS</strong><br>

Vanbrugh-tastic! And it has its own website which is informative and

idiosyncratic: <a href=http://www.castlehoward.co.uk/> http://www.castlehoward.co.uk/</a>. The photos are arty and moody rather than actually worth looking at.  Ho hum. There are, though, some nice reproductions of architectural drawings.

<p>

The Castle Howard website people complain that the only portraits of

Vanbrugh (and those of the Kit-Cat club) are in the National Portrait

Gallery which has a policy not to allow Internet reproductions. Boo!

Although Hurrah! for the NPG's own website which is useful as a guide

to what's on show, with a few pictures: <a href=http://www.npg.org.uk/> http://www.npg.org.uk/</a>.

<p>

<strong>BLENHEIM PALACE, OXON</strong><br>

Still on the Vanbrugh trail, but sadly less to ogle electronically.

There's a small amount of information about the palace and Vanbrugh

himself at <a href=http://ernie.bgsu.edu/~smorgan/publick/blenheim.html> http://ernie.bgsu.edu/~smorgan/publick/blenheim.html</a>.

These pages have a style of design which is, let's say, not to

everyone's taste. If it is (!) you can link to many others under the

proprietor Jeremy Boot's auspices, many of which concern the

activities of radio hams.

<p>

<strong>AUDLEY END, ESSEX</strong><br>

Not a great deal to shout about except the bare essentials at

<a href=http://www.locata.co.uk/info/audhse.htm> http://www.locata.co.uk/info/audhse.htm</a>.

<p>

<strong>HATFIELD HOUSE, HERTS</strong><br>

The barest essentials are at <a href=http://www.kidsnet.co.uk/places/hatfield.html> http://www.kidsnet.co.uk/places/hatfield.html</a>.  Better is <a href=http://www.britain.co.uk/pages/H/HAT95NQbA.html> http://www.britain.co.uk/pages/H/HAT95NQbA.html</a> which has

several pictures: don't forget to click on the left picture for

larger version, and on the right-hand ones to swap them round. It'll

make sense when you get there.

<p>

CERES did find one other picture, but it was a holiday snap linked to

a 1995 holiday diary from a 16-year-old girl. Good taste intervened.

<p>

<strong>WILTON HOUSE, DORSET</strong><br>

Again, nothing, except details so bare they make previous use of term

'barest' seem unwise: morsels on Dorset's great houses (also

ATHELHAMPTON HOUSE, BREAMORE HOUSE, etc.) at

<a href=http://www.lds.co.uk/dt/houses.html> http://www.lds.co.uk/dt/houses.html</a>.  There's a tiny picture of ATHELHAMPTON at <a href=http://www.shogun.demon.co.uk/dorset/athelham.htm> http://www.shogun.demon.co.uk/dorset/athelham.htm</a>.

<p>

Grose Educational Media has thoughtfully but rather curiously decided

to reproduce a 1919 article by Ernest Law which discusses

Shakespearean performances at Hampton Court, which is the only

surviving building in which Shakespeare's plays were performed. Head

Tourist info at <a href=http://www.locata.co.uk/info/bolscas.htm> http://www.locata.co.uk/info/bolscas.htm </a> but the

interesting thing about Bolsover is the geophysical survey undertaken

by English Heritage in order to establish the layout of an earlier

formal garden. This is pretty interesting and there are various

pictures of the castle as well as 3-D underground image things. Go to

through the pictures (and few words) at <a href=http://www.johansen.com/hotelnet/windsor/home.htm> http://www.johansen.com/hotelnet/windsor/home.htm</a>.  The best thing here is the 1607 bird's eye view by John Norden.

<h2 align=center>REVIEW OF CHADWYCK-HEALY'S<br>LITERATURE ONLINE (LION)</h2>

<h3 align=center>INTRODUCTION</h3>

For a number of years Chadwyck-Healey have been quietly knocking up

electronic texts of most of English Literature. Some of these have been

scanned in electronically; others have been typed in (for digital character

recognition software has still not worked its way back to an adequate

recognition of Renaissance typefaces). And apparently they have all been

checked. Generations of Cambridge undergraduates have been seen in summer

vacations at the University Library padding hollow-eyed from reading room to

tea room and back again contemplating the Augean labour of checking the

complete works of Thomas Shadwell or William Shenstone not for sense (for

that would be too much to ask) but for spelling. The results of this ongoing

project will be familiar to many already. For several years now CD-ROMS of

C-H's English Poetry and English Verse Drama databases have been in use in

academic libraries, and more recently has appeared the eminently useful if

flaccidly softwared 'Editions and Adaptations of Shakespeare' (See Digest I). Literature Online aims to unite all of C-H's databases under one

aegis. The benefits are 4-fold: (i) the databases can be searched

individually or together, as is not possible with a collection of CD-ROMS;

(ii) online access means that the customer will always be using the most

up-to-date versions both of the databases and of the searching software;

(iii) because the searching is done by the powerful C-H mainframes, and not

by a library PC, results are accessible more quickly, even when web download

times are allowed for; and (iv) the service is accessible from anywhere in

the world, so whole texts or search results can be downloaded direct to the

user's own computer.

<p>

LION (and we do love a good acronym) is wondrous, and we are already finding

it indispensable. However, it is important to know its limitations, and to

realise that for all its comprehensiveness and speed, it is still a very

blunt instrument where research is concerned. But it is clearly the most

significant online literary resource to date, and with its clear intent of

housing a comprehensive and ever-expanding range of services under one roof,

it looks like it will keep the lead it already has on any rivals; it is here

to stay. If your academic institution is not already thinking of

subscribing, put that thought in its mind. Even if LION's usefulness to you

is restricted to the most mundane of its capabilities - tracking down

quotations and phrases you cannot place - it is likely to save you time, and

it has not always been possible to say that about the infliction of

technological developments on our working lives in the last decades. First

of all, though, a guided tour.

<p>

LION has distinct URLs for the UK (<a href=http://lion.chadwyck.co.uk/>http://lion.chadwyck.co.uk/</a>) and the States (<a href=http://lion.chadwyck.com/>http://lion.chadwyck.com/</a>); obviously,

as ever, use the one closest to you. The home page looks the same whether

or not you have subscribed to the database. If you haven't, some links will

be turned off, and others will take you to information about the service

rather than to the service itself. If you have been granted access

temporarily you may have been given a special URL and password (e.g., for

reviewing purposes). But in most cases, LION lets subscribers straight in by

recognising the IP (Internet Protocol) address of the computer accessing it.

This may be a library computer; in the event of large-scale licenses being

granted, it may be any

computer within a certain domain (e.g. cam.ac.uk). [If you need to know your

IP address, you can get LION to tell you what your computer is telling it by

going to http://lion.chadwyck.co.uk/envtest.cgi]. Multiple-user licenses

will allow a limited number of concurrent users to access each database;

these tend to allow more users for the more popular databases (verse) than

for the less (Early English Prose Fiction), so it is just possible that

access will be denied because 5 other people are also trying to get to grips

with Nashe and Greene. Information about arranging trials is of course

available at the home page.

<p>

As well as recognising your computer, LION will recognise your browser

software; sort of. There are two versions of Literature Online. One uses

'frames', which means that some areas of the page remain intact when you

download some new stuff. This protocol has speed advantages, but it is also

governed by a more complicated logic. Where traditionally each page you saw

had a separate URL, so that your browser knew what it was showing you, with

frames this is not the case. So if you try to use the back/forward buttons

on your browser, you may find that things get rather muddling (see below).

The frames version of LION is optimised to run with Netscape Navigator

version 3.0 or higher, which uses Java scripts to reinstate an intuitive

back/forward option presented within the page rather than via your browser's

toolbar. Internet Explorer 3 also has frames capability, so if you access

LION with this software you will get the frames version, but the

back/forward option may not work. As usual, you are most likely to have

problems with older browsers and non-Windows 95 machines. We have not

experimented with every configuration of hardware and software, but in many

cases problems arising from the frames version of LION can be avoided by

going to the non-frames version, whither you will be sent automatically if

LION recognises that you have a non-frames-aware browser such as Netscape

Navigator 1.2. Follow the links, or go straight to

<a href=http://lion.chadwyck.co.uk/noframes/home/home> http://lion.chadwyck.co.uk/noframes/home/home</a>.  In essence this is exactly the same as the frames version, except that LION's own buttons are on the left instead of the right, and the whole is painted a more lurid orange. Some procedures have more stages to them, but the non-frames version is in no way less powerful or flexible. You may also find it faster, for complicated reasons involving caches which you don't

want to know about.

<h3 align=center>REFERENCE WORKS</h3>

Literature Online contains the following reference works:

<ul>

<li><strong>Annual Bibliography of English Language and Literature</strong>:

ABELL aims to list monographs, periodical articles, critical editions of

literary works, book reviews, collections of essays and doctoral

dissertations published anywhere in the world. The bibliography consists of

69 volumes beginning in 1920 and issued annually in printed volumes. It is

not in practice as up to date as BIDS/First Search, but it is very full.

<li><strong>Bibliography of American Literature</strong>: BAL contains nearly 40,000 records of the literary works of approximately 300 American

writers from the period of the Revolution to 1930.

<li><strong>The King James Bible - 'Authorized' Version</strong>:  

The King James - 'Authorized' Version is included to provide a single Bible

for reference purposes. Boxes on the search form (fill in any or all) allow

searching by keyword, testament, and book, and a 'Go to' option can take you

direct to any specified point. The full text is hypertexted with, e.g.,

concordance notes. Perhaps an accident, but certainly a blessing; the choice

of the AV means that this will be very useful for tracing allusions and

quotations direct, without getting sent to other people's allusions and

quotations.

<li><strong>Periodicals Contents Index--Literature</strong>:  

An index to over 800,000 periodical articles in the field of literature from

1857 to present day. The focus is upon journals produced in the twentieth

century, but those beginning in the nineteenth century and continuing into

the twentieth are published from their inception. Perhaps that might be

extended one day to include major C19 journals which didn't outlive their

queen. Nevertheless, very nice, this, as it makes far more likely the

noticing (and less likely the duplicating) of all that fantastic Victorian

scholarship so often buried in the Proceedings of the Bognor Philological

Society and Antiquaries Club. Very good also for reviews of things literary

from past decades. Past scholarship becomes as noisy as present, almost, and

the balance of accessibility and retrieval is redressed somewhat.

<li><strong>Webster's Third New International Dictionary, Unabridged</strong>:  

America's premier lexicographical work; the 1993 edition is published here

in electronic form for the first time. A dictionary of the English language

containing 450,000 vocabulary entries. Searching is done by filling in any

or all of boxes Headword, Keyword, Etymology Keyword, Author/Quotation

Keyword, Part of Speech. This would be even more useful if it were the UK's

premier lexicographical work. But we don't wave flags.

</ul>

<p>
<hr align=center width=75%>

<a name=websources></a>

<h3 align=center>WEB RESOURCES</h3>

Rather surprisingly, LION is fully aware of the wider world's web of

complementary services, and so provides sample lists of, and links to, web

resources indexed under categories (Discussion Lists and Groups, Author

Pages, Research Resources, Journals) and periods. These are all right,

though neither very up to date nor all that comprehensive. But the awareness

of the WWW is also integrated into the searching facilities to some extent,

as we shall see below.

<p>
<hr align=center width=75%>

<a name=help>

<h3 align=center>HELP</h3>

There is help available for each database, and at each point of entry to a

search. At the home page Help these are listed. It's probably worth looking

at 'Navigating Literature Online' here, and at the index of help topics for

searching the literary databases in order to get to a useful summary of the

different search options, including boolean operators (x and/or/not y),

proximity searching (x near y), and truncation (truncat*).

<p>
<hr align=center width=75%>

<a name=litdbases>

<h3 align=center>LITERARY DATABASES</h3>

Literature Online contains the following literary databases:

<ul>

<li><cite>All</cite><br>

Allows searching of all the literary databases together.

<li><cite>African-American Poetry (1750-1900)</cite><br>

Nearly 3,000 poems written by African-American poets in the late eighteenth

and nineteenth centuries.

<li><cite>American Poetry (1600-1900)</cite><br>

Over 40,000 poems by more than 200 American poets from the Colonial Period

to the early twentieth century.

<li><cite>The Bible in English (990-1970)</cite><br>

20 different versions of the English Bible from the tenth to the twentieth

century, including 12 full Bibles, 5 New Testament texts, 2 versions of the

Gospels only, and William Tyndale's translations of the Pentateuch, Jonah

and the New Testament.

<li><cite>Early English Prose Fiction (1500-1700)</cite><br>

Over 200 complete works in fictional prose from the period 1500-1700. The

most recent addition; lots of lovely old-spelling editions and some

facsimile title pages...

<li><cite>Eighteenth-Century Fiction (1700-1780)</cite><br>

77 complete works in English prose from the period 1700-1780, by writers

from the British Isles. Includes a scanned version of Sterne's Tristram

Shandy, and two different editions of Richardson's Clarissa and Pamela and

of Swift's Gulliver's Travels.

<li><cite>English Drama (1250-1900)</cite><br>

A combination of Chadwyck-Healey's English Verse Drama and English Prose

Drama full-text databases. 4,000 plays by 1,200 authors from the late

thirteenth century to the early twentieth century.

<li><cite>English Poetry (1100-1900)</cite><br>

Essentially the complete English poetic canon from 1100 to 1900. Over

165,000 poems by more than 1,250 poets drawn from nearly 4,500 printed

sources. This is the largest database, and seems to have the largest gaps.

</ul>

<p>
<hr align=center width=75%>

<a name=master></a>

<h3 align=center>MASTER INDEX</h3>

The Master Index allows searching of the entire database, including its

records of e-texts available elsewhere on the WWW, by author or title. It

does not search full texts. Type a surname and go, or browse to get a box to

look for the exact form of a name. [Remember with all such web- forms to

click on the box you want to enter text in, and that tab/shift+tab will take

you back and forward between boxes.] A search on an author will return all

his or her works, with separate poems indexed individually; so this is not

perhaps the quickest way to see what's there. The title keyword search is

good. For instance, one could search for everything with 'English' in its

title, or mentioning someone's name; at this point the separate indexing of

titles of poems is useful, as name searches will return good stocks of

dedicatory epistles and epigrams. Boolean and truncation searches work here;

these are very good in our period at finding variant forms of names. The

truncation can only be made at the end of a phrase so search 'Lucy Countess*

or Lucie Countess* or Lucye Countess*' but 'Countess of Bedford* or

Countesse of Bedford*' to allow for all likely variants. Punctuation marks

are ignored in searches so the first will not fail to find 'Lucy,

Countess...'. Truncations are also good for names adjectivised. Remember

with all searches that if your search term contains any of the logical

operators (and, or, not, near) you must put it in inverted commas.  For example, <cite>trouble and strife</cite> will find all documents containing both words, whereas

<cite>'trouble and strife'</cite> will find only instances of the whole phrase.

<p>

The browse option will give you a list of every word which occurs in a

title/author field in the whole database, with the number of occurences, so

you can browse the entire lexicon if you have the patience. By using ctrl

and then clicking you can select any number of these, to arrange a multiple

author search, or a title search like:<br>

"arcades" OR "arcadi" OR "arcadia" OR "arcadian" OR "arcadians" OR

"arcadias" OR "arcadie" OR "arcady" OR "arcadye"<br>

This is how LION displays an ideal search by the way, for clarity's sake,

though of course you would get the same results from:

<br>arcades or arcadi or arcadia or arcadian or arcadians or arcadias or arcadie

or arcady or arcadye<br>

The software will show you 50 entries at a time unless you tell it to show

more (up to 99). This is worth adjusting on some occasions, so as to avoid

multiple pages of search results which can get in the way of a quick browse

back and forth.

<p>

Having specified your search criteria and got some results you may wish to

get back to your search box (to make some alterations) by using your

browser's 'back' button. Do not be surprised if on going back to the search

page you find that it is now blank again. This may not always happen, and it

will happen less if you use the non-frames version of LION, or the Java

back/forward facility incorporated in the frames version. But to avoid it,

notice that clicking the search icon in the results page allows you to

'refine search'. This will take you straight back to the search page, with

your search criteria preserved. Usually.

a contextual table of contents (most commonly the contents of the complete

poems or plays or prose fiction of the author concerned). Also displayed on

this page are the titles and URLs of any e-texts at other websites of which

LION is aware.

<li>Contextual table of contents, every item of which is highlighted.

These are tabulated in a hierarchical way, the more indented entries being

subsets of the less indented ones above them. There are some funny icons to

the left of each item; the lozenge shaped one will display the same table of

contents with more 'context' for that item; the other one will do it with

less. This is all rather complicated and vexatious, but you'll work it out

if you want to. The point of it is to enable you to select exactly the form

in which you finally get your text, either, for instance, the single sonnet,

or the whole sequence, or the whole volume.

</ol>

<cite>NB If at this stage (3) you click on 'refine search' it will take you not to

the search you were conducting but to a page enabling you to search the

particular database you are now in. Not a bug; but a pest.</cite>

<li>4.  Text at last (refine search works as above)

</ol>

<p>

You might want at this point to save or print your text. There are various

options. You could cover some with the mouse, and copy and paste it

somewhere else. You could select all the text via 'edit' on the menu bar,

though with older, smaller RAMed machines there may be a limit to the amount

of text the computer can paste in one go. You could do clever things with

the right mouse button if you know how to do that. Note that this is another

stage at which the frames version of LION may upset you. If you have a page

of text in front of you and try to save it as a file, your computer may save

the upper frame of icons because that was the last thing it downloaded and

that is where it is. So you may need first to click on the text itself;

there will be no visible effect, but your computer will now be where you

are. Another question is in what form to save the text. If you save it as a

file, you will have to save it as html (.html or .htm). This includes all

the codes around the text telling your machine how to display it. If you try

to save it as text (.txt) you will still get all the html codes. Only by

copying and pasting will the text and only the text be translated into .txt.

BUT, saving as html has advantages, such as preserving italics, which are

lost when text becomes txt. And if you have swanky Word 97 for Windows 95,

you word processor will be able to display html files anyway. Bear in mind

that in some situations you will want to print off the text but will not be

that fussed about keeping an electronic copy. In which case consider

printing direct from your web browser, a much underused option. In the

non-frames version you will get all the supporting icons and pictures, but

not in the frames version, which will give you only the text part of the

page (but remember to click on the text first...!)

<p>

Using Master Index you can also retrieve a number of hits by sampling (you

specify the number). There is not much point to this, except for journalists

and students wanting to stick a pin in the complete poems of X (in which

case, better surely to browse the contents page of a real live book), or to

get a representative selection of poetic sentiments on the theme of meadows

or lust.

<p>

A word about LION's texts. A number of factors have the potential to

vitiate the texts available on LION. For copyright reasons many of the

texts on LION are less than up to date. Where possible, particularly in

their earlier databases (poetry and drama) C-H have taken texts from

modern editions out of copyright. This tends to mean that they are by

Grosart. If this does not worry you, read Sprague's tactful remarks on

the good reverend's shortcomings in his edition of Daniel's poems. Where

this has not been possible, they have gone back to the original printed

text. In some cases (like the excellent new Early English Prose Fiction

database) they seem to have done this as a first option, so,

delightfully, we get not Feuillerat's Sidney's Arcadia, but an edition

of the 1593 text. Minor authors, represented sometimes in their entirety

from the original texts, complete with preliminaries, are often better

represented than very major ones, available only via a poor and

incomplete 'collected' edition. Also, the electronic versions of

original texts are usually more satisfying, and easier to navigate, than

the e-texts of modern collected editions. It is much simpler to survey

and sample the complete works of a writer if, say, his 20 publications

are listed on screen as such - and are then available complete with

publication details from the title page and preliminaries - rather than

splattered across a single collected edition which doesn't give their

dates and hasn't included dedications. In this medium 20 small virtual

volumes are easier to work with than one big one. In general, then,

expect a mish-mash of both old and modern spelling editions, and adjust

your searches to allow for this. But be aware that some of the texts are

riddled with errors, either because of poor typing or checking, or

because scanning is rather haphazard (a poorly printed e will often be

read by the character recognition software as a c, for example). In many

cases, a text (and in some cases an author) is simply not there at all.

Recent changes in copyright law (i.e. the extension of the copyright

period) mean that while Hebel's Drayton was on the verse CD-ROM, it is

not on LION. So if you are using LION for cross-sectional lexical

searches of the whole of English Literature, you will need to acquire a

sense of what is missing. There are pleasant surprises, however. It

looks like where a text was first printed only in recent times (and a

great many women's manuscript works fall under this category) C-H have

in some cases been able to get hold of e-texts of (portions of)

copyright editions. So some texts are well-edited, and accurately

digitised. LION is in many ways most useful not for providing access to

electronic versions of texts we all possess, but in allowing ready and

alternative access to the sorts of texts which one can most often only

read on UMI microfilms, the sort of 2 copies in the world texts like

Markham's English Arcadia [imagine your reviewer's excitement!] or

Gamage's Linsi-Woolsie. It is also great for containing vast amounts of

lousy C18-C19 poetry and drama - and, indeed, for searching through it

with no nose for quality -, and so is particularly well adapted to

reception history sorts of projects (I found a frightening number of

poems about Sidney at Zutphen).

<p>

The division of portions of text means that any lump of data with a

title can be accessed separately. So one can go direct to a single

sonnet, which will appear on a page of its own. One can then back up to

its context, and display the whole run of sonnets, or whatever. At first

this is really annoying. But once you start using LION not just to

browse texts, but to conduct tightly specified searches, your annoyance

transfers to the texts which are not so generously pieced up. Machines

with less than 16MB RAM have problems displaying large files, and where

the smallest portion of a novel or play is 50 or 300K, the computer will

freeze up and think a lot before it finishes processing it. Not to

mention the more familiar slow downloading problems. So if you are not

downloading such a text to keep but just to glance at the occurrence of

a word or phrase, time can be consumed. But LION is very well organised

in telling you the size of every file it offers you, and in giving a

reasonable amount of text surrounding each 'hit', so you can decide when

to bother, and when to use LION to direct you to a place in a paper

book.

<p>

Annotations are a problem. Texts, like Jonson's editions of his own

works, which come already annotated have had their notes included in the

databases, but these are always in separate files, one file per note.

This is the most irritating feature of LION. It is simply not possible

to see all the notes at once, to know what is in a note before

downloading it (although its size is displayed), or, if one wishes to

download a text for keeps, to include the notes in the text's file.

Sometimes such annotations are essential to a text, but the software

discourages one from bothering either to read them, or to download each

and every one if one is compiling one's own library of e-texts (which,

by the way, is fully allowed by C-H who accept that they cannot hope to

keep hold of every bit of text, but know that they will remain unique in

providing the facility to search them all). Why oh why cannot the

software find a way of sticking the relevant notes at the bottom of the

page?

<p>

So much for the digression, and for the master index. Now for ways of

searching the meat of the databases...

<p>
<hr align=center width=75%>

<h3 align=center>SEARCHING LITERARY DATABASES</h3>

<p>

Each of the databases can be searched in one of three ways

<ol type=1>

<li>via the master index (dealt with above)

<li>via the search all literary databases option

<li>individually, for the most sophisticated search options

</ol>

<p>

<strong>SEARCH ALL</strong><br>

1.  This option allows searching of the full texts (including dedicatory

matter, etc.) by keyword or author; once again, fill either or both boxes

either directly or by browsing and selecting; then press the search button.

This is the best way to search all the literary texts in LION for

occurrences of words; as noted above truncations are essential for old

spelling, as are boolean operators; remember to allow for some needlessly

preserved old-spelling oddities like vv for w; truncations are also good for

getting a variety of word-forms from a common stem. For instance, 'Sidne* or

Sydne*' will find most references to Sidneys, Sidneians, Sidneides, and the

Sidneyesque.

<p>

2.  Having submitted your search, you will have returned to you a 'Summary

of Matches'; these are listed by database, and each entry tells you how many

hits are in each database, and under how many separate entries (e.g. there

may be only three hits in only one text so you will be told 3 matches and 1

entry). Click on the highlighted database names and you will enter the

particular database (e.g. early prose fiction)...

<p>

3.  Summary of matches within database. This page lists each entry (not each

match) separately by author and title of work; it tells you how many matches

are in each entry, and offers the table of contents icon; scroll down this

page, and if necessary any following pages for 50+ entries (though you can

again circumvent this by specifying that the search display up to 99 entries

per page). Click on an interesting looking one, either the highlighted title

(i), or the TOC icon (ii)...

<p>

4.  (i) Context of matches. This page tells you more precisely what the hit

is, and gives you a good few words of context, usually enough to determine

whether or not to go further. This page will also offer a number of ways

into the text: for instance, just the text, or the text plus prefatory

matter, or the whole edition from which it is taken...<br>

    (ii) Contextual table of contents, which works as described above when

we got there via the Master Index

<p>

5.  Text. This will be flagged with icons (called 'first hit' or 'next hit')

which will jump you to the point in the text at which the match(es)

occur(s). It will also offer you the contextual TOC, which you may want to

look at if you came direct via 4 (i).

<p>

At each of the above stages you can start a new search or refine your

search. As noted in the master index section, once you have started to look

at information specific to one database (stage 3 above), clicking on the

search icon (the magnifying glass) may take you to a search box for that one

database only. We are slightly confused by this, as it appears to work

inconsistently by database, and by frames/non-frames interface. Clearly C-H

should allow access to both sorts of search page from every point in such a

search.

<p>
<hr align=center width=75%>

<a name=searching></a>

<h3 align=center>SEARCHING INDIVIDUAL DATABASES</h3>

Searching a single database is an option all along of course. From the home

page go to the literary databases, and select not 'search all' but the

particular database you need. The search pages for individual databases are

much more complex and flexible. For the verse database, for instance, you

can search for key words or phrases in the text or in the titles or first

lines only; you can restrict the search to authors of one or other gender;

you can search only rhymed, or only unrhymed, poems; you can exclude or

include apparatus, dedicatory material, arguments, and epigraphs; and you

can limit the period. In all cases click on the arrows to the right of the

boxes for the list of options. The list of periods here is interesting,

because it is not really or only that, but a quite helpful series of

categories under which texts have been grouped, such as 'Emblems, Epigrams,

Formal Satires, 1500- 1700' and 'Songbooks, 1500-1700'. Again, in the drama

database you can search by keyword, play, title, speaker, playwright, genre,

period, gender, date first performed, and date first published. You can

always tell which database you are in because there will be a representative

mugshot above the toolbar, so verse has Tennyson, Early English Prose

Fiction has Bunyan, and Drama has some rouge-cheeked bloke in a wig. If you

get lost, however, use the LION toolbar to take you back to the Master Index

or Literary Databases start points.

<p>

Going back and forth is the whole problem with frames, and the reason why

you may need to consider using the non-frames version - except perhaps for

printing things off - even if your browser displays frames. Typically you

will search all the databases at once, you will get a summary of matches,

you will view the summary for a particular database, and perhaps you will

look at the context of a particular entry. Very often you will not download

the text, because you are really only browsing. You will then press the

'back' button on your browser to go back up to the summary of matches in

order to view the entries in another database. In frames, you will probably

get a blank screen; pressing 'back' again will take you back to the search

page, which will be empty or will perhaps contain a search you conducted

previously; to get your search results, you will have to resubmit your

search. If this happens, and LION's own back/forward buttons don't work, use

the non- frames version of LION, which ought to work more logically. It took

us a while to work this out, because C-H don't like to trumpet their

shortcomings too loudly. Even without frames you may still find your search

criteria have been lost when you back up to the search page; the best way

round this is to use 'refine search' to get back to this page, though, as

noted above, sometimes this will give you the wrong sort of search page.

Clearly, C-H need to think about making it possible to jump straight from

any point in a search back to a previous one; for example (most obviously)

from a full text within a particular database to the summary of matches

across all the databases. The safest thing to do if you are worried about

losing your search criteria is to use a clever clipboard like 'Clipmate'

(available from HENSA) to keep the criteria safe, or to copy them once

entered (using the browser's edit menu, which, as we are constantly

observing, you must get into the habit of using to copy URLs from Harvest to

your browser's address box; we worry about you...) into a dummy word

processor document. It is very vexing to come up with a beautiful search

term like <cite>fresh field* or freshe field* or fresh feeld* or freshe feeld*</cite> only to find it lost.

<p>

While we're on the subject of search criteria, we very much like the 'near'

option. This finds two words within 10 words of each other (it doesn't

matter which order you give them in). If you add a full stop and a number

you can alter the range to, say, within 5 words, or 20: <cite>hand near.15 foot</cite>.  

By the way, LION does not allow, as does AltaVista's advanced searching,

parentheses like the following, and it ought to: <cite>(fresh field* or freshe field* or fresh feeld* or freshe feeld*) near pastures new*</cite>.  Because <cite>fresh field* or freshe field* or fresh feeld* or freshe feeld* near pastures new*</cite> will only match the last variant to 'pastures new*'.

<p>

<a name=summary>

<h3 align=center>CAVEAT, SUMMARY</h3>

<p>

<strong>HAVE WE COVERED EVERYTHING?</strong><br>

No. There are many features we have scarcely touched on, such as quick

referencing links from the full text page to the dictionary, and other

pieces of padding. We are aware that some of the information above is

confusing, and that in some cases this is because we are confused. But this

confusion is heuristic. Be confused by our confusion, and you will be half

way to acquiring the instincts necessary to cope with LION's eccentricities.

We hope that you will be encouraged to explore LION, or to arrange a trial

at your institution. It is certainly a way forward. But they must improve

their software. In particular, navigation is poor, and their grasp of the

point and function of hypertextual layers to texts is not good, though they

are hampered by the rather impossible constraints of the ways they chose to

input and demarcate the zillions of bytes of information they possess when

they first began to input them many years ago. Chadwyck-Healey are certainly

to be congratulated on what they have come up with so far. LION's databases

are awesome; their computers search it and return results to you with

exemplary speed; and the appearance of LION is attractive and user-friendly.

Searches are flexible, though do not quite allow the complexity sometimes

needed. It is to be hoped that they will respond to criticism, that they

will improve texts when they can, that they will replace Grosart editions

with better texts as these come out of copyright, and that they will find a

way of filling some of the big name gaps like Spenser. As an indication of

their momentum, just look at what is coming soon to LION:

<ul>

<li>Carcanet poets (Sept. 97): all Carcanet's contemporary poets, in toto

<li>Cambridge Encyclopedia and Cambridge Biographical Encyclopedia (Sept. 97):

not a leap into more general territories but, ostensibly, a resource to help

LION users identify references in the texts

<li>Master Index upgrade taking responses into account, and software

enhancements. (Enhancements to the LION software will be released every

three months.)

</ul>

<p>

AND, the next upload of Literature Online will include further literary

databases including Editions and Adaptations of Shakespeare, English Prose

Drama, and a collection of contemporary English Poetry. There will also be

an update to ABELL.

<p>

<strong>SUMMARY</strong><br>

LION is a very fine thing. But, for the very expensive service that it is,

it is also a very flawed thing. Its software will improve, and like all

online services you will always find it easier to use with a powerful PC/Mac

and the most up to date browser. But it will never get rid of all its typos,

or the omissions and emissions of the poorer of the editions it has had to

use, and I for one am not about to start e- mailing C-H every time I detect

an error. So it will find you a great many things you would never have known

about without it, though it will not find all the things it might if it were

100 percent accurate, or if it contained absolutely every English literary

text, as one day it will. And if you use it not to find new stuff but to

search texts you have read or at least heard of for occurrences of words and

phrases, know that it may miss a few. It will usually find you what you

need, but sometimes it won't, because that poem is set in Ardadia, and this

is addressed to VVatson. Use it with a wariness of its weaknesses as well as

an understanding of its strengths.
