While the RSGS welcomes the opportunity to respond to queries of a geographical nature, it does not maintain a full-time research staff, and so has limited time and resources to carry-out searches.
</p>
<p align=justify>
To cover the cost of staff time, the Society charges a search fee of &pound;20 per hour or part thereof, chargeable on queries which extend beyond 10 minutes. &nbsp; <a href="collecti.htm#charges">Photographic and photocopying charges</a> are detailed on our <a href="collecti.htm">Research Collections</a> page. &nbsp; Reproduction fees for material of which we hold the copyright are additional to this, at rates which can be negotiated with the Director, depending on the type of publication involved.
</p>
<p align=justify>
In any case, you may find that you can easily answer your query yourself by using of one or more of the many powerful Internet search engines which are currently available. &nbsp; As one possible starting-point, the Andersonian Library of the University of Strathclyde provides a useful list of <a href="http://www.lib.strath.ac.uk/web.htm">Web Gateways and Search Services</a>.
</p>
<p align=justify>
The Society's own <a href="books.htm">book</a>, <a href="maps.htm">map</a>, <a href="photocol.htm">photo</a> and <a href="archives.htm">archive</a> collections, which are outlined on separate pages, may help to answer some queries.

<h3>The Gazetteer for Scotland</h3>
<font color=maroon>
<p align=justify>
As a specific contribution to the dissemination of geographical information, the Society is involved in a collaboration with the University of Edinburgh, which has developed an online <a href="http://www.geo.ed.ac.uk/scotgaz/">Gazetteer for Scotland</a>, a comprehensive geographical database, accessible internationally via the World Wide Web. &nbsp; The project is designed to complement and enhance the <a href="http://www.geo.ed.ac.uk/home/scotland/scotland.html">Gateway to Scotland</a> WWW site, &quot;the definitive source of information about Scotland on the Internet&quot;.
</p>
<p align=justify>
The RSGS Director, Dr David Munro has contributed to the Gazetteer for Scotland Project in his work with Bruce Gittings at the University of Edinburgh. &nbsp; The project has been supported by a grant from the Robertson Trust, but sponsorship is now invited to enable completion  of the project and its continuing maintenance.
</p>
<p align=justify>
For further information regarding the project and its sponsorship, please contact <a href="mailto:bruce@geo.ed.ac.uk ?subject=Gazetteer for Scotland">Bruce Gittings</a>.
