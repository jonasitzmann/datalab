</TD></TR></TABLE><BR><B>lasgow,</B> the commercial and manufacturing capital of Scotland, and, in point of wealth, population, and importance, the second city of the British islands, is situated for the most part in the lower ward of Lanarkshire, but a small part of it is in the county of Renfrew. It stands on both banks of the river Clyde, 14 miles from its mouth at Dumbarton; but the larger portion of the city is on the N side of the river; latitude 55&deg; 51' 32" N, and longitude 4&deg; 17' 54" W. Its distance as the crow flies from John o' Groat's House is 197 miles, and from London 348. It is NW by N of London and Carlisle, SW of Aberdeen, Perth, and Stirling, SW by W of Dundee, W by S of Edinburgh, and N by W of Dumfries. By road it is 42&frac34; miles from Edinburgh, 23 from Greenock, 34 from Ayr, 79 from Dumfries, and 396 from London; while by railway its distance is 7 miles from Paisley, 21 from Falkirk, 23 from Greenock, 29 from Stirling, 33&frac34; from Kilmarnock, 40&frac12; from Ayr, 47&frac12; from Edinburgh, 63&frac14;. from Perth, 104&frac12; from Berwickon-Tweed, 105 from Carlisle, 152 from Aberdeen, 206&frac12; from Inverness, 401&frac12; from London by the West Coast route, 423 by the Midland, and 448&frac12; by the East Coast route. <P><I>Site.</I>&#151;At no very remote time in the geological history of the country, but long before the historic period, the lower part of the valley of the Clyde formed the bottom of an estuary. This estuary opened to the sea by a narrow strait near Erskine, and embraced Loch Lomond and the valleys about on the one hand, while on the other it extended as far as Johnstone and Paisley. Narrowing at Ibrox and Pollokshields, it again widened out, and, sweeping round by the Cathkin and Cathcart Hills, formed a wide bay where Glasgow Green and Bridgeton now are. The mouth of the river was then probably about Bothwell or Rutherglen. That the estuary was marine the list of shells found in the deposits in the valley abundantly proves. That the levels of the land were much the same as at present dung the Roman occupation is shown by the termination of the Roman Wall; but that prior to this, and yet subsequent to the first appearance of man in Clydesdale, there must have been an upheaval of the land is shown by relics dug up on the present site of Glasgow. Among other remains a number of canoes have been found, some of them 300 feet distant from the modern bed of the river and 19 feet below the present surface. In the eighty years prior to 1855, no less than seventeen canoes were dug out of the silt-one in 1780 in digging the foundations of St Enoch's church, and another later near the Cross. In 1824 one was found at Stockwell Street, and another in the Drygate behind the new prison. Twelve were found on the lands of Springfield, on the S side, and two at Clydehaugh in 1852. Of all these, one was in a vertical position, with the prow up, as if it had sunk in a storm; while another was bottom up, as if it had been capsized. Since 1855 other three at least have been found. All this points to a considerable rise within the human period, and accounts for the traces of ancient terraces that are to be seen along some portions of the higher grounds, as well as for the nature of the site of the lower part of the city, which, especially towards the E and S, is very flat, as it also is on the N along the side of the river. Nowhere in these districts is it more than a few feet above the level of spring tides. The ground on the N side of the river beyond the flat strip and to the W is variable and undulating, there being a number of elliptical ridges mostly with their longer axes parallel to the course of the river, but in the W trending somewhat more in a N and S direction. They rise with considerable rapidity to heights of from 100 to 0 feet, the principal being Blythswood Hill (13d), Woodlands Hill (153), Hillhead (157), Garnet Hill (176), the Observatory site (179), the Necropolis (225), and Garngad Hill (252). The city is intersected and divided into two unequal portions by the river Clyde, which has within it a course of about 6 miles, following the windings from the E at Dalmarnock Bridge to a point on the W nearly opposite Govan. The Molendinar Burn swept round the NE, passed between the Cathedral and the Necropolis in a deep ravine, and afterwards crossed the low ground to the Clyde; but it has now become a dirty underground sewer, though the ravine still partially remains. The river Kelvin approaches from the NW through a picturesque and wellwooded dell, skirts the base of the height on which the Botanic Gardens are laid out, and, sweeping to the southward, forms the boundary between Hillhead and Glasgow. In its onward course it passes through the West End or Kelvingrove Park, between the high grounds to the E of the Park and Gilmore Hill on the W, and then, bending to the SW, enters the Clyde opposite Govan at Govan ferry. Glasgow has about its. site none of the picturesque features that give such beauty and well-marked character to Edinburgh. The features of the views within all the low parts of the city, and even in the suburbs, are mainly architectural, and always distinctly modified by the smoke and turmoil of a great seat of commerce and manufacture. From a few of the higher spots-particularly from Sighthill Cemetery, Garngad Hill, the Necropolis, Blythswood Hill, Garnet Hill, the upper part of Kelvingrove Park, and Gilmore Hill in front of the new University buildings-there are, however, in clear states of the atmosphere, views of considerable picturesqueness, the foreground of the city, with its streets and buildings and bustle, being backed by glimpses of the country and shut in by distant hills. <P><I>Extent.</I>&#151;The exact extent of Glasgow is somewhat difficult to define, as the districts to be embraced by the name are variously understood. The compact central portion of it measures about 2&frac14;. miles by 1&frac12;; the area covered by buildings, but exclusive of detached parts and straggling outskirts, measures about 4 miles from E to W and about 2 from N to S. The area comprehended in the returns of population includes, besides the separate burghs of Hillhead, Partick, Maryhill, Govan, Crosshill, Kinning Park, Govanhill, and Pollokshields, the detached suburbs of Strathbungo, Crossmyloof, Langside, Tollcross, Shettleston, and Ibrox, and comprises 21,336&frac34; acres, of which 1209&frac12; acres are in Renfrewshire. It measures about 9&frac14;. miles from E to W, and about 5&frac14;. from N to S. The royal burgh lies all on the right bank of the Clyde, and comprises 988&frac12; acres. The old royalty also lies all on the right bank of the river, and includes the royal burgh as well as very considerable suburbs and some tracts of open country; it comprises 2336&frac12; acres. Prior to 1872 the municipal and parliamentary burgh excluded much of the old royalty, but included tracts beyond it both N and S of the Clyde, and comprised 5034&frac12; acres. By an act of parliament passed in 1872 the boundaries were largely extended to the N and W. Of the sixteen wards into which the city is divided, the third, fifth, tenth, and eleventh were considerably affected. The third ward is now bounded on the N and E by the old royalty line, and on the W by Springburn Road. It takes in the St Rollox malleable iron works, the Caledonian Railway Company's engineering works, the Sighthill railway station, and the new Alexandra Park, together with intermediate places. The fifth ward is now bounded on the N by the old royalty line, on the E by Craighall Road, and on the W by Springburn Road. It includes a considerable part of the large detached suburb of Springburn, Sighthill Cemetery, Cowlairs railway station, and Keppoch Hill hamlet, together with intervening places. The tenth ward now includes the district extending from the Forth and Clyde Canal to the royalty boundary, and from Craighall Road to Keppoch Row. The eleventh ward now includes a portion of Kelvingrove Park formerly outside the municipal burgh, and, crossing the Kelvin, takes in the lands of Gilmore Hill with the new University buildings. Starting from a point on the Monkland Canal at the NE corner of Alexandra Park, the parliamentary and municipal boundary line skirts the E side of the park till near the SE corner, and then turns in a straight line SE for more than a mile to a point near Shettleston Sheddings, E of Parkhead. From this it turns SW, and runs in a straight line for a mile to the river Clyde at the W corner of the corporation reservoirs, from which it proceeds down the middle of the river to the mouth of the Malls Mire Burn, on the S side of the river, opposite the middle of the S end of Glasgow Green. There it turns up the burn for about 1000 yards till it reaches the boundary line between the counties of Lanark and Renfrew, near Eastfield. It follows this boundary to a point lying to the S of the S corner of the Southern Necropolis, and then passes straight W to the E end of Butterbiggins Road, and then along this road in a line W by S, and, still keeping in a straight line, crosses Victoria Road and on to the county boundary, where it passes into Renfrewshire near Eglinton Saw-mills. Here it turns to the NW, and runs in a straight line to Shields Road near the Shields Road station, from which it strikes NW by N in a straight line to a point in the river Clyde opposite Finnieston Quay. Passing down the Clyde to the mouth of the Kelvin it turns up the latter stream to the Dumbarton Road, the line of which it follows for a short distance W, till it turns northward along the W side of the Western Infirmary grounds as far as University Avenue. Turning eastward along this street, it proceeds in a straight line past the S end of Anderston Free church to the river Kelvin, and again follows the course of that stream to a point directly N of Glasgow Academy, whence it passes in a straight line NE, till it reaches the Glasgow branch of the Forth and Clyde Canal at Firhill Saw-mills. From this the centre of the canal is the line of boundary to near Napiershall, whence the line passes eastward somewhat irregularly to Cowlairs. There it passes through the North British engine works northward to the E end of Hawthorn Street, and then curves along through Springburn, past the gateway of the Barony Poorhouse, and on to a point on the Monkland Canal E of Blochairn steel-works, whence it proceeds along the N side of the Alexandra Park to the point first mentioned. Its total length is about 17 miles; while the length of the municipal burgh, from Hawthorn Street on the N to Butterbiggins Road on the S, is in a straight line about 3&frac12; miles; and from Shettleston Sheddings on the E to the mouth of the Kelvin on the W about 5 miles. There are nearly 900 streets within the boundary line, the total length of which must exceed 100 miles. Very little of the area within the municipality is now unbuilt on, and so much is the city hemmed in by its suburban neighbours, that extension of the boundary is well nigh impossible except by annexing the surrounding burghs, a proceeding to which the latter always show strong aversion. The mother city made a vigorous attempt in the 'No Man's Land' bill in 1875 to begin this swallowing-up process; but the successful resistance then made by Crossbill will probably prevent, for a long time to come, any effort to renew the trial. <P><I>Appearance.</I>&#151;A stranger entering Glasgow by any of the ordinary routes is not likely to be favourably impressed by it. By the Edinburgh and Glasgow branch of the North British system and by the northern branch of the Caledonian, he enters through dark and smoky tunnels. By the Bathgate branch of the North British, he enters through dingy suburbs and streets of a decidedly unpleasant aspect; while, by the southern branch of the Caledonian, the approach lies through murky mineral fields, amid the blaze of iron-works. By the Glasgow and South-Western line, he approaches amid houses of an inferior description. If the visitor come by road&#151;excepting the approach by the Great Western Road through Billhead&#151;it is much the same; while, if he come by the river, long ere reaching the city he has left the beauties of the Clyde behind, and  finds himself moving slowly along a river which is not at all pure or sweet, amid a motley array of shipbuilding yards and engineering establishments resounding to the rattling of many hammers. No sooner, however, does he reach the centre of the city than he finds a vast difference in the character of the streets and in the surroundings, and sees on every hand buildings displaying both beauty and taste. Few exterior views of the city or of parts of it are interesting; and from the fact that no exterior view of it as a whole can be got, it is difficult to carry away from Glasgow any general impression. The best of the exterior views is from the Cathkin Hills, and they are too far off (3 miles) to allow of a distinct idea. <P><I>Lines of Street and Districts.</I>&#151;The city had its origin on the high ground adjoining the western side of the Molendinar Burn ravine, nearly a mile N of the Clyde; and as any extension immediately eastward was impracticable in consequence of the opposite side of the ravine being flanked by steep rising ground, the earliest enlargements took place over rapid slopes to the SE and SW to the flat ground towards the bank of the river. From this the extensions, which, till the latter part of last century, constituted the main bulk of the city, passed southward to an ancient bridge across the Clyde on the site of the present Victoria Bridge. The central line of thoroughfare through these extensions was the Bell o' the Brae (High Street NE of its intersection with George Street), leading to the flat ground, and then continuously High Street, Saltmarket, and Bridgegate to the bridge. This was intersected at the S end of High Street at the Cross by a transverse line of streets running E and W, Gallowgate striking off to the E and Trongate to the W. The principal extensions of the latter part of last century and the early part of the present century went westward, along the plain over all the space between the high ground and the river, the main thoroughfares being George Street, along the base of the high ground; Argyle Street, a continuation of the Trongate westward; and a number of transverse streets running in a direction nearly parallel to High Street and Saltmarket. Other extensions of contemporary date went eastward along the sides of the Gallowgate, and thence spread still farther to the E and SE, forming suburbs; while a small suburb of ancient date, at the S end of the bridge across the Clyde, spread rapidly E and S and W. The more recent extensions which have taken place to the N and NE, very largely to the S, and most of all to the W, have been very wide, so much so indeed that they have not only taken in outlying suburbs of some antiquity, but have also created new ones of considerable size; while the lines of streets exhibit an amount of imposing architecture in public buildings, works, warehouses, and private houses of much greater account than that of all the previous portions of the city. The westward extension on the N bank of the river reaches from about the line of Hope Street to a line fully a mile W of the Kelvin, and measures more than 2 miles in length by a mile in mean breadth. This is the finest of all the extensions, and, consisting mainly of elegant private residences, with places of business and public buildings interspersed, constitutes on the whole a West End somewhat similar to the West End of London. Some parts of it are still of a somewhat straggling character, but it is expected, with good reason, to be fully occupied with the exception of the open ornamental areas. This portion of the city has the great advantage of including the heights at Blythswood Square and Garnet Hill, the high grounds to the E of Kelvingrove Park and Gilmore Hill, with the reaches of the Kelvin between; and is comparatively free from the smoke and turmoil that prevail in most of the other parts of the city. It offers indeed, along with the suburban districts, so many advantages for residence that probably ere long, out of business hours, the central portion of Glasgow will be as little inhabited as the city in London, and the whole area given over to business purposes. <P>From the outline of the growth of the streets of Glasgow just given, it will be evident that the older and more irregular part of the city, with the usual closes and narrow and crooked streets, will lie to the E of the Cross, while the districts to the W, N, and S show greater regularity of plan, the streets in most cases intersecting at right angles, though the branching of some of the main roads causes in many places minor deviations by the formation of triangular and irregularly shaped blocks. As might be expected from the course of the river Clyde, the main lines of thoroughfare run in a direction more or less from E to W, with cross streets from N to S; but this regularity is best marked in the districts on the S side and between Argyle Street and George Street and Argyle Street and Sauchiehall Street. <P>In the south-eastern suburbs, extending for fully a mile in length and with an average breadth of 2&frac12; furlongs, is the public park of Glasgow Green, all that now remains of the old common ground. It is bounded on the N partly by mean dingy streets, with murky factories, and partly by neat terraces. The streets leading westward are spacious, and for more than &frac12; mile are not encumbered by buildings on the river bank. Beyond this they are harbour approaches. The areas at the College Station E of High Street, and of George and St Enoch's Squares, break in this district the prevailing density of the street masses. The great West End district displays a fine assemblage of handsome streets, terraces, and crescents, intermixed with open ground and spaces laid out with shrubs. The great lines of thoroughfare from N to S are by Springburn Road, Castle Street, High Street, Saltmarket, Crown Street, and Cathcart Road in the E; and by Garscube or New City Road, Cowcaddens, Renfield Street, Union Street, Jamaica Street, Glasgow Bridge, Bridge Street, and Eglinton Street in the centre and towards the W; and subsidiary lines are by Port Dundas Road and Buchanan Street, and by Glassford Street, Stockwell Street, Victoria Bridge, Main Street (Gorbals), and Pollokshaws Road. The main line of thoroughfare from E to W is by Great Eastern Road, Gallowgate, Trongate, Argyle Street, Main Street (Anderston), and Dumbarton Road. There are also subsidiary lines along both banks of the river, and by Stirling Road, Cathedral Street, Bath Street; by Parliamentary Road and Sauchiehall Street; and by Duke Street, George Street, St Vincent Place, Renfield Street, Cowcaddens, and Great Western Road. The great part of the streets on the S side are, as will be seen from the historical section, much more modern than the central part of the city. The compact districts of the city and the continuous suburbs on the outskirts have separate names, and were either originally separate villages or took their names from separate estates. On the N are Cowcaddens-which takes its name from being the part of the common land which was set apart for the feeding of the town's cattle-Port Dundas, St Rollox-a corruption of St Roche, who had in the district a chapel noticed in the historical section-and Dennistoun; on the E Caltonan old barony-Camlachie, Mile-End, and Bridgeton; on the S Gorbals (an old barony), which has various subdivisions. The lands were left in 1650 by Sir George Douglas in trust to the magistrates, one-half for Hutcheson's Hospital, one-fourth for the Trades House, and one-fourth for the city. The lands were divided in 1789, and the part acquired by the hospital was called Hutchesontown; what fell to the Trades House, Tradeston. Lauriston was built on the hospital ground in the beginning of the present century, and Kingston about the same time on the part belonging to the council. On the W are Blythswoodholm-from the ancient barony of Blythswood; Anderston-from Mr Anderson, who was proprietor of the Stobcross lands in 1725, and laid out the plan of the original village; Finniestonnamed after Mr Finnie, a tutor in the family of Mr Orr, who had bought the estate of Anderston, and who laid out a plan for a village about 1765; Sandyford, Kelvinhaugh, and Woodside. Anderston, Finnieston, Gorbals, Hutchesontown, Tradeston, and Kingston were quite recently detached country villages. The suburban villages and burghs still only connected with the main part of the city by chains of houses or by partly open road, are, on the NW, Maryhill and Keppoch Hill; on the N, Springburn; on the E, Shettleston, Eastmuir, Hogganfield, Provanhall, Tollcross, Parkhead, and Barrochine; on the S, Crosshill, Strathbungo, and Pollokshields; on the WSW, Kinning Park, Govan, Govanhill, and Whiteinch; and on the W, Partick and Hillhead. <P><I>Streets and Street Architecture.</I>&#151;The city is in general remarkably well built. The building material is a fine light coloured sandstone, the masonry substantial, and the frontages in most parts lofty and good, though there is often a tendency towards too profuse ornamentation and to a rather factory-like arrangement of windows. The older districts are mostly squalid, and have little or none of the picturesqueness of the older Scotch architecture which gives such a characteristic and quaint aspect to the older portions of other of the old towns of Scotland. Most of the other districts are plain in style, and with nothing to distinguish the appearance of the houses from that of dwellings in any of the other stone-built towns in Britain, though the newer districts show more ornament, some of it running to heaviness and in questionable taste. The older districts about Drygate, High Street, Gallowgate, Bridgeton, Saltmarket, Bridgegate, Trongate, the Wynds, Gorbals, and Calton have been much altered and improved between 1866 and the present time. The operations of the City of Glasgow Union railway and still more of the City lmprovement Trust, acting under an act obtained in 1866, have removed altogether or greatly altered and improved a number of narrow and dirty courts, lanes, and streets that were in their old state mere hotbeds of disease and crime, and defied alike the efforts of sanitary inspector and police to improve them. The newest districts of all are ambitious and showy; some parts in very tasteful Italian; others abounding in pillared porches, projecting or divided windows, balconies, and balustrades; while the grand front range on the crown of the hill overlooking the West End Park is in the French style. A strong fondness is shown for pillar decoration even up to the Corinthian and composite, but the type adopted is often poor. The great number of new buildings erected along the principal streets since about 1840 shows a desire for variety of style and profusion of ornament which sometimes lead to rather striking results. While edifices of Norman, Italian, Flemish, and Scottish styles stand side by side with one another and with old plain buildings, a strong lofty ornate iron shell often replaces stonework, and sometimes efforts are made to replace the absence of decoration by glaring effects in paint. These last features are, however, exceptional, and, while no doubt pleasing to the eye of many, they considerably mar the general effect to an eye of even not very severe taste. High Street, Rotten Row, and Drygate retain but few signs of their former grandeur, though the last was once filled with the mansions of the aristocracy of the West. Alas, how are the mighty fallen! One of the best buildings in it now is a well-planned lodging-house erected by the City Improvement Trust, and containing accommodation for 200 persons. Rotten Row (originally <I>routine</I> and rue, as it was the usual road of the church dignitaries to the Cathedral ?) used formerly to contain the residences of several of the prebendaries of the Cathedral. The city gas-works were removed from it in 1872. Bell o' the Brae, the upper part of High Street, has been removed by the Improvement Trust, and the slope of the street lessened. The old name was derived from a bell placed in a small turret at its top, and always tolled at funerals. Duke's Place, adjacent to Drygate, contained an ancient house at one time belonging to the Earl of Lennox, and afterwards to the Duke of Montrose, where Darnley's illness took place, and where Queen Mary visited him. It was removed in 1853. Its connection with the Duke gave name to Duke Street. John Knox Street, extending across the Drygate to Argyle Street, was formed by the City Improvement Trust in 1872. It replaced a cluster of wretched houses called the Rookery, and is overlooked from the brow of the neighbouring Necropolis by John Knox's Monument. Ladywell Street, in the same neighbourhood, contains a small restored structure over a well, anciently dedicated to the Virgin. Duke Street, a continuation of George Street eastwards to the suburbs, has to the N the district of Dennistoun with pleasant villas. It is not entirely built, and contains the North Prison and the Cattle Market. A road branching off on the left leads to the Alexandra Park. George Street is in line with Duke Street to the W. It is a straight well-built street, and contains the buildings of the Andersonian University. High Street has been very much altered by the action of the Improvement Trust, but still contains in itself and the neighbouring courts a crowded population of the lowest class. A number of buildings densely populated and nearly opposite the station have been pulled down, and their site is now occupied by Canon Street. <P>Saltmarket, extending about 2 furlongs S in a line with High Street to the river and to the South Prison at Albert Bridge, was once the place of residence of the magnates of Glasgow-the Bailie Nicol Jarvies of their time, and gave lodging to James, Duke of York (afterwards James VII.), when he visited Glasgow. It became the rag fair of the city, and, with some of the streets leading from it, was the abode of people in a condition of the most squalid poverty. Prior to 1822 it contained some old houses, but in that year extensive reconstruction took place with a view to the improvement of the condition of the inhabitants. The effort failed, and no improvement was effected till the operations of the Improvement Trust and the Union railway cut off many of its closes, and almost revolutionised it. On the E side at the N corner of Steel Street was a house where Oliver Cromwell lived when he was in Glasgow. Bridgegate, leading westward from the S part of Saltmarket, also was once a place of high note. It contained the mansions of several noble families, an d afterwards the only banks of the city, the Merchants' Hall, and the Assembly Rooms where the Duchess of Douglas used to lead off the Glasgow civic balls in the last century. Here also the Union railway and the Improvement Trust have effected great improvements. St Andrew Square, 120 yards E of Saltmarket, and connected with it by St Andrew Street, was built in the latter part of last century as an aristocratic quarter, and it shows a symmetry worthy of its importance and purpose, an appearance enhanced by St Andrew's Church in the centre. It soon fell into disrepute, and is now hugged on every side by squalid alleys. London Street, extending ESE from the head of Saltmarket, a straight, open, well-built street, was formed at a comparatively recent period. It was intended as a convenient outlet to the SE suburbs to which it leads, partly by the line of Great Hamilton Street, partly by Monteith Row and Glasgow Green. The south-eastern suburbs are Bridgeton, Barrowfield, Mile-End, and Calton. These have mostly a dingy appearance, and contain a considerable number of factories-cotton, linen, jute-and chemical and iron works. They have been improved by the construction of two spacious streets under the Improvement Act. Gallowgate, striking off eastwards from the Cross at an acute angle with London Street, leads to the suburb of Camlachie. It was formerly the principal outlet on the E, but now has little to attract attention except here and there some dwarfish old dwelling almost hidden by the neighbouring houses. About 3 furlongs eastward from the Cross stand the old Barrack buildings, superseded in 1876 by new barracks near Maryhill. Near the Cross it was formerly very disagreeable and even offensive, but the widening and levelling of the street, and the demolition of a number of unsightly tenements at the point where it is crossed by the Union railway, have vastly improved it, as has also the formation of Watson Street. Trongate, the early state of which is noticed in the historical section, was the seat of all the main business of the city so late as the time of the tobacco trade in the latter part of last century. It has everywhere a width of 60 feet or upwards. The buildings are stately, though some of them are old. It contains the Cross Steeple (the tower of the old Tolbooth) the Tontine buildings, the equestrian statue of William III., the Tron Steeple, and an imposing block of buildings (1858) in the Scottish Baronial style which occupies the site of a house where Sir John Moore was born. Trongate and its continuation westward, Argyle Street, are the busiest thoroughfares in Glasgow. Candleriggs, at right angles to Trongate, on the N, is an old street (1722), but it has been thoroughly modernised. It has on the E side the City Hall, and St David's church is at the top. Hutcheson Street and Glassford Street, parallel to Candleriggs, are handsome open streets. The former is named from Hutcheson's Hospital, which stands at its top. It contains also the County Buildings and the City Chambers. Glassford Street (1792) is named from a distinguished merchant of the times of the tobacco trade mentioned by Smollett in his <I>Humphrey Clinker.</I> On the W side is the Trades Hall. Stockwell Street, going S to Victoria Bridge, is older, and was long the SW verge of the city. <P>Argyle Street&#151;mentioned under the name of West Street (as leading from the West Port) in the early part of the 18th century, and under its present name as early as 1777-extends from Trongate westward to Anderston, and is as spacious and stately as Trongate. The centre dates from the beginning of this century, and the western part is subsequent to 1820. The older part has been almost entirely reconstructed. It is a very crowded thoroughfare, and as a seat of business is scarcely surpassed by any street in Europe. Virginia Street (N) was formed in 1753, and was then occupied by mansionhouses. It takes its name from a house called Virginia House, which belonged to a Virginia merchant named Buchanan, and stood on the site now occupied by the Union Bank. Miller Street (N) was opened in 1771, and got its name from the proprietor of the ground. It was also intended for mansions, and Mr Buchanan in his <I>Desultory Sketches of Glasgow</I> tells how when it was first laid out no feus were taken off for some time, as it was considered too far out of town, a statement that gives a far better idea of the increase in size of Glasgow within the last century than pages of description. Dunlop Street (S) had at its head of old the Buck's Head Hotel, long a place of high city note. From 1840 to 1868 the Theatre Royal was also here. Queen Street (N) is on the line of the Cow Loan, by which the cows of the inhabitants (kept in a common byre on the site presently occupied by the Royal Exchange) passed to the public pastures at Cowcaddens. It was constructed in the end of last century, and is now one of the best streets in the city. It contains the Inland Revenue Office, the offices of the National Bank, the old Stock Exchange, and the Royal Exchange. At the N end is the station of the North British railway. Buchanan Street (N) is parallel to Queen Street. It was opened in 1778, and took its name from the owner of the ground. At first it was not intended to connect it with Argyle Street, but the plan was afterwards changed. The situation is described in an advertisement as being ' rural and agreeable. ' Even so late as 1816 it was the western street of the city. It was occupied by villas, and was so quiet that grass grew abundantly on the carriageway. It is now lined with fine shops and lofty and elegant business tenements. It contains the Western Club, the new Stock Exchange, St George's Church, and the original terminus of the Caledonian railway. The Argyle Arcade passes E from Buchanan Street, and then, turning off at right angles, enters Argyle Street. The block of buildings in Venetian style at the corner of Buchanan Street and Argyle Street was erected in 1873 at a cost of &pound;20, 000. St Enoch's Square (S) was originally an aristocratic quarter, with villas, and in the centre were shrubberies. It was gradually given up to business, and about 1850 the open central space was appropriated for a cab stand. At the S side is St Enoch's Church. On the E side is St Enoch's railway station and Hotel. Union Street (N) is, though short, architecturally one of the finest streets in Glasgow, the E side being largely occupied by magnificent and tasteful warehouses, some in the Grecian style, others with quasi-Egyptian features. Jamaica Street (S) was formed about 1760, and was then in the country. Now it is almost as busy as Argyle Street, and thronged with people and machines passing and repassing to Glasgow Bridge. W of Union Street and Jamaica Street the cross streets are uniform in character and without any special features. Anderston, to the W of Argyle Street, was founded in 1725, and at first occupied by weavers. It afterwards became the chief seat of the marine steam-engine establishments, and of other manufactures. It is a crowded malodorous sooty place, with very inferior houses. <P>Ingram Street striking eastward from Queen Street opposite the Royal Exchange, was formed in 1777 on the line of the Back Cow Loan. It contains the British Linen Company's Bank, the Union Bank, the Athen&aelig;um, Hutcheson's Hospital, the N frontage of the County Buildings, and St David's Church. On the E are Campbell's warehouses completed in 1858, and exhibiting turrets, dormers, and other features of the Scottish Baronial style. Between Ingram Street and George Square is South Hanover Street, which contains a range of fine Italian warehouses built for the Macdonalds, a great firm of muslin manufacturers, but lost to them in the monetary crisis of 1857. George Square (1782) was originally surrounded by aristocratic private residences, with a spacious garden in the centre. It became in course of time the centre of crowded thoroughfares, and, in 1865, it was stripped of its central trees, and crossed by numerous paths. The whole space is now open, and there are a number of monuments of those whom the city delights to honour. The post office is on the S side; the Queen Street station of the North British railway on part of the N. On the W side are the offices of the Bank of Scotland and the new Merchants' Hall, while the E side, which is at present occupied by a range of half ruined houses, is by-and-by to be adorned with the new Municipal Buildings. <P>St Vincent Place, which runs W from the SW corner of George Square, is spacious and open with fine build ings. It contains the main front of the Bank of Scotland, the New Clydesdale Bank, and a very handsome insurance office. St Vincent Street, a continuation of the Place westward, was one of the first of the new western streets, and outstripping the others passed over Blythswood Hill to Anderston. It was originally dwelling-houses, but the E half is now given up for business premises. At its highest point is the St Vincent Street United Presbyterian church. West George Street, parallel to St Vincent Street to the N, has the fine ornamental range of Stirling's warehouses and the Gartsherrie offices, erected about 1860. At the E end is St George's Church. Regent Street, parallel to West George Street, and a number of the cross streets in the same quarter, are handsome and airy and occupied by dwelling-houses. On the summit of the high ground at the W end of Regent Street is Blythswood Square, a spacious opening surrounded by dwelling-houses. There is a central enclosure of grass, and at the SW corner is St Jude's Episcopal church. Bath Street runs W from Buchanan Street. The buildings at the E end are devoted to business, but the rest of it is occupied by dwelling-houses, a number of hotels, and several churches. <P>Sauchiehall Street, at first parallel to Bath Street and then turning WSW to the vicinity of Kelvingrove Park, has, till 183h, a quiet narrow suburban thoroughfare called Sauchiehall Road. The eastern part is now a plain spacious business street with some fine shops. The western part comprises a fine series of villas, terraces, and crescents, with lawns and shrubberies in front. It stands to Argyle Street very much in the same relation as Oxford Street in London does to the Strand. The square blocks of buildings to the S in Renfield Street, Nile Street, and West Regent Street are known as Victoria Buildings. The style is an imposing combination of the old Scottish and Flemish styles. The buildings which are 241 feet in length and 92 in height, and contain upwards of 420 windows, were erected in 1860 by Archibald Orr Ewing, Esq., and contain warehouses, shops, counting-rooms, and public offices. On the S side of the street, near the centre of the business part, are Caledonian Buildings, a picturesque erection in rich Italian style, and here also stands the Institute of the Fine Arts where are held the Glasgow Art Exhibitions. It is a building in the Greek style, plain but dignified. At the E end are the Royalty and Gaiety Theatres. From the N side of Sauchiehall Street, opposite Wellington Street, there is communication with Cowcaddens by a series of arcades called the Wellington Arcade. They are much the same as the Argyle Arcade, but not quite in such good style. Cowcaddens was, as has been already mentioned, the common pasture for the cattle belonging to the citizens. It is now a compactly built and densely populated district. It contains the Theatre Royal, the Grand Theatre, and the Free Church Normal School. N of Cowcaddens on an elevated ridge is Port Dundas, where is the harbour of the Forth and Clyde and the Monkland Canals. The appearance of the lines of boats amid lofty houses on the crest of a ridge some 60 feet above the adjacent level is somewhat peculiar. Port Dundas is mainly a place of commerce and manufacture, and has large warehouses and granaries. There are here a very large distillery and grain, flour, and saw mills. Garnet Hill, flanking the N side of Sauchiehall Street, near the centre, rises so steeply in some parts as to be very inconvenient for carriages and traffic, but is nevertheless covered with streets of a genteel class. It commands views of the city and south-western suburbs better and more extensive than even those from Blythswood Square. The western part of Sauchiehall Street and the districts round are known collectively as the Crescents. The district measures about 5 furlongs by 3, and contains numerous terraces which are well and uniformly built with houses of good style, mostly varieties of Italian, set off by the lawns and shrubs. On the higher ground near Park Circus, and overlooking the whole district, rise the tower of Park church and the campanile of the Free Church College. Sandyford lying beyond, and occupying the district between the Clyde and the Kelvin, has a number of genteel streets. <P>From Cowcaddens the line of street is extended westward by the New City Road and the Great Western Road. The tract to the N of this was till 1830 quite open, but it is now largely built on. Across the Kelvin lies the separate burgh of Hillhead, the whole of which is of quite recent structure. It covers an area of about 5 by 4 furlongs. The streets are wide and airy, and most of them have good houses; while there are a number of terraces, with grass plots and trees in front. The Botanic Gardens are in Hillhead, on the N side of the Great Western Road. SW of this is the burgh of Partick, extending towards the Clyde. It is large enough and populous enough to outrival many a provincial town that plumes itself on its importance. The part towards the river is occupied by densely-populated streets, the denizens of which are somewhat noted for their rough character; but on the rising-ground to the N are immense numbers of detached or semi-detached villas, which render this district one of the prettiest and pleasantest about Glasgow. Govan, on the S side of the Clyde opposite Partick, was once almost a rival of Glasgow. It is about a mile in length by 2 furlongs in breadth, and lies along the bank of the river. The older parts of it show plain cottages, now somewhat dingy; the newer parts show well-built streets and neat villas. The bank of the river is occupied by shipbuilding yards, and the place has also a silk factory and a fine church steeple, modelled after that of Stratfordon-Avon. Gorbals, which lies E of Govan along the S bank of the Clyde, is the largest and most populous district in the city, and is indeed large enough of itself to rival Aberdeen or Dundee. It might in every way be described as the Southwark of Glasgow. It measures about 2 miles by 1 mile, and has, in connection with new manufactures, with railway works, and with harbour works, spread rapidly and widely between 1835 and the present time. It comprises the districts of Plantation, Kinning Park, Kingston, Tradeston, Laurieston, and Hutchesontown. Some idea of the rapid growth of these districts may be gathered from the fact that, between 1861 and 1871, the population of Kinning Park increased from 651 to 7217. The streets are mostly regular, but vary very much in style. Some of them, leading to Pollokshields, Crosshill, and Mount Pleasant, are handsome and good. Eglinton Street and Victoria Road, leading from Glasgow Bridge to Queen's Park, is a fine line of thoroughfare. Crosshill, close to the Queen's Park, not long since a mere village, is rapidly becoming a thriving town of villas. <P>Gorbals proper is a name sometimes given to the parts of Laurieston and Hutchesontown adjoining the Clyde near Victoria Bridge. Its chief thoroughfare used to be a wretched old, narrow, and tortuous street called Main Street, ribbed with closes of the most squalid and dismal order, every house in which was overcrowded to an alarming extent. At that time it was such a hotbed of quarrels and disturbance that it was known as ' Little Ireland. ' The City Improvement Trust has, however, driven a new street with a width of 70 feet straight over the old site of Main Street and its closes, and it has also formed a series of new streets from Kingston Dock to the E end of Hutchesontown. At the intersection of this line with Main Street a sort of square has been formed, measuring about 200 by 180 feet, and known as Gorbals Cross. Hutchesontown farther E still is about 6 by 4 furlongs, and has of late years been very much modified by the operations of the City Union railway, which passes through the western part of it. It contains a number of cotton factories and an iron-work, with blast furnaces that send up a continuous glare. <P><I>History.</I>&#151;Unlike many of the populous and enterprising towns of the present day, Glasgow can boast of a history which proves that, even in those remote times when trade and commerce were unknown, it was a place of considerable importance. The name Glasgow does not appear till the 12th century, but there were two villages called Deschu and Cathures on the same site. These names, however, bore so little resemblance to the present form, that the connection was difficult to trace. M 'Ure, the earliest historian of Glasgow, says that ' it is called Glasgow because in the Highland or Irish language Glasgow signifies a grayhound or a gray-smith. ' The <I>new Statistical</I> takes graysmith or dark glen, the latter referring to the ravine at the Molendinar Burn. Wade, in his <I>History of Glasgow</I>, gives Welsh <I>glas</I>, ' green, ' and <I>coed</I>, ' a wood,the green wood. But Mr Macgeorge, in his <I>Old Glasgow</I>, seems to have solved the difficulty. He suggests that the transcribers of the old MSS. mistook <I>cl</I> for <I>d</I>, and so wrote Deschu instead of Cleschu, from which comes Gleschu, and hence Glasgu and Glasgow (Glas, ' green, ' and <I>ghu</I>, ' beloved, ' the name being therefore the beloved green place). In the early part of the Christian era we find the district inhabited by a tribe called the Damnonii, who were, during the time the Romans held the Wall of Antoninus, under Roman rule within the province of Valentia. This wall, in its course from Old Kilpatrick on the Clyde to Blackness, passed a short distance to the N of Glasgow; and there are also the remains of a large camp, said to be Roman, on the lands of Camphill, near the battle-ground of Langside, about 2 miles S of the city. Probably there were Roman garrisons at stations scattered among the conquered tribes behind the wall, and of these one is said to have been at Glasgow; but nothing except the vague tradition of its existence is known, not even its name. When the Romans retired, the district became part of the Cumbrian British kingdom of Strathclyde; but the important place in this connection is Dumbarton, then the chief town, and called Alclyde or the Rock of the Clyde. St Ninian-who was trained at Rome, and founded the church of Whithorn in 397-according to the 12th century <I>Life of St Kentigern</I> by Jocelyn of Furness, established a primitive church and consecrated a burial-ground at a place called Cathures, where Glasgow Cathedral now stands. This was about the beginning of the 5th century, but his influence seems to have passed away with himself; and when Deschu next emerges from obscurity, it is in connection with its later and locally more famous saint, Kentigern or Mungo, who made his appearance in the district somewhere near the middle of the 6th century, and probably about 543 A.D.St Kentigern or Mungo was the son of Ewen ap Urien or Eugenius, a prince of the Britons of Strathclyde-according to some the King of Cumbria-and Thenew, daughter of Loth, King of Northumbria, or, according to others, King of the Lothians, to which he is supposed to have given name. Though Loth was ' a man half pagan, ' his daughter had become a convert to Christianity, and, according to the legend, in her zeal for her new faith, became desirous of rivalling the virginal honour and maternal blessedness of the Virgin Mary. In carrying out her purpose she scorned all suitors, Prince Eugenius, who had her father's influence to back him, among the rest. To escape from farther trouble, she at last fled to a remote part of the kingdom, and concealed herself in the lowly guise of a swineherd. Prince Eugenius, however, followed her and found her, and she returned to her father's court, only to be relentlessly condemned to death on account of her condition. Though she denied all crime, her father refused to listen to her prayers for life, and handed her over to the executioners to be stoned to death. They preferred the easier plan of casting her over a precipice, Dumpender or Traprain Law, but she escaped unhurt. This was considered clear proof of sorcery, and she was put into a corade, which was taken down the Forth to the Isle of May and there set adrift; but this was no more fatal to her than the former attempt, for a shoal of fishes made their appearance at this opportune moment and carried the boat on their backs to the shallow water at Culross, on the N side of the Firth of Forth. Here Thenew landed and gave birth to a son, and both mother and child were brought by some of the country people to St Serf or Servanus, a disciple of St Palladius, who had here established a little monastery.* He received them into his household, where the infant received his nurture, and was taught the rudiments of his faith. The boy, named Kentigern (Welsh <I>cyn</I>, ' chief,' and <I>teyrn</I>, ' lord '), turned out so well as he grew up, that he became a great favourite with the aged Serf, who gave him the pet name of Munghu (Welsh <I>mwyn</I>, ' amiable, ' and cu, ' dear '), whence came the second name of ' Mungo, ' by which the saint is now probably better known than by the name of Kentigern. As he grew in years and knowledge, he displayed a faculty for working miracles which soon attracted attention. He restored to life a robin-redbreast whose head had been cut off; one winter night when the fire was quenched by his enemies, he kindled it again with a frozen branch which he blew into a flame; during harvest the cook died and there was no one to provide food for the reapers, whereupon St Serf himself came and enjoined his Mungo either to restore the cook to life or to fill his place, a command which he obeyed by bringing the cook to life again. Obeying a monition of the Spirit, he secretly left Culross to devote himself to work in other places, and went southward, the waters of the Forth opening to allow him to pass. He was followed by St Serf, who, looking forward to him as his successor, begged him to return; but feeling his duty to lie elsewhere, he would not go back. Journeying westward, he found, at a place called Kernach, an aged Christian named Fergus, to whom it had been revealed that he should not die until he had seen one who was to bring back the district to the faith of St Ninian, and who almost as soon as he saw St Mungo, fell dead on the ground. Taking the body with him in a cart drawn by two wild bulls, the saint proceeded on his journey till he reached Deschu and Cathures on the banks of the Clyde, and here, in the churchyard consecrated by St Ninian, he buried Fergus. His fame must have either gone before him or must have spread very rapidly, for he was almost immediately visited by the king and the leading men of Strathclyde, who begged him to become their religious guide. The saint, who was only twenty-five, pleaded his youth as an excuse; but they were determined to have him, and he was consecrated by a bishop brought from Ireland for the purpose. His habits were very ascetic, for he is said to have been in the habit of often rising in the middle of the night and rushing into the Molendinar Burn, where he remained in the water, no matter what the season or the weather, till he had recited the whole of the Psalms of David. He still retained miraculous power. A young man who scoffed at him was killed suddenly by a falling weight; he sowed sand and a crop of fine grain grew; he ploughed a field with a team consisting of a wolf and a stag. At length, however, he became involved in a quarrel with the king -Morken-because in answer to a mocking taunt of his majesty he had actually caused the Clyde to sweep the contents of the king's barns at Cathures up the Molendinar Burn to Deschu. Morken shortly after, using violence to the saint, was killed by being flung from his horse, and the saint, to escape the vengeance of the king's relatives, had to flee to Wales. Here, after remaining for a time with St David, he founded a monastery, and gathered about him a band of disciples at the place now known, from the most celebrated of his followers, as St Asaph's. The victory of Arthuret (573) placed Rydderch Hael on the throne of Strathclyde, and he at once despatched an embassy to Wales to St Mungo to urge him to return to his old abode on the banks of the Clyde, and, the effort succeeding, the saint's power became greater than before. His miraculous gift continued, and was exemplified in a very wonderful way in connection with the queen. This lady, named Langueth, had received from her husband at their marriage a peculiar ring, of which she was not so careful as she should have been, and which she had entrusted to the keeping of a soldier with whom she was in some way connected. The king one day found the soldier sleeping, and noticed the ring on his finger, and, his anger being roused at the small value the queen thus seemed to set upon the jewel, he took it from the man's finger, and casting it into the river, went straightway to the queen and told her he wished for the ring. She urged delay, and sent at once for it, but it was, of course, not to be found; and her majesty in great dismay applied to the saint, who forthwith came to her rescue. He told her to cause a fishingline to be cast into the Clyde, when the first fish that was caught would be found to have the ring either in its mouth or in its stomach. This turned out exactly as he had said, and the ring being thus restored the jealous monarch was satisfied. <P><FONT SIZE="-1"> * The anachronism involved in this portion of the legend has been already noticed under Culross.</FONT> <P>This incident has given the city the main features of its armorial bearings, while other incidents in St Mungo's life have supplied the whole. The arms, as settled by the Lord Lyon, King of Arms, and described in his patent granted at Edinburgh on 25 Oct. 1866, are -'Argent, on a mount in base vert an oak tree proper, the stem at the base thereof surmounted by a salmon on its back, also proper, with a signet ring in its mouth, or; on the top of the tree a redbreast, and on the sinister fess point an ancient hand-bell, both also proper. Above the shield is to be placed a suitable helmet, with a mantling gules, doubled argent, and issuing out of a wreath of the proper liveries is to be set for crest the half-length figure of S. Kentigern, affront&eacute;, vested and mitred, his right hand raised in the act of benediction, and having in his left hand a crozier, all proper: in a compartment below the shield are to be placed for supporters two salmon proper, each holding in its mouth a signet ring, or; and in the escrol entwined with the compartment this motto, " Let Glasgow flourish." ' The salmon and the ring are connected with the foregoing story; the tree is the branch with which the monastery fire was lighted; the bird is the robin that was miraculously restored to life; and the bell is the consecrated one that was brought from Rome by St Mungo when ho visited the sacred city in his later years, and which was placed in the college buildings, and preserved in Glasgow till the Reformation, or perhaps to a later date. It was called St Mungo's Bell, and was tolled through the city to warn the inhabitants to pray for the repose of a departed soul. These tokens appear on the seals of the bishops of Glasgow in the 12th and 13th centuries, from which they were transferred to the common seal of the city in the beginning of the 14th. This at least seems a probable explanation, and as such it is now accepted in preference to the fanciful theory propounded by Cleland in his <I>Rise and Progress of Glasgow,</I> where he says, ' The tree is emblematical of the spreading of the Gospel: its leaves being represented as for the healing of the nations. The bird is also typical of that glorious event, so beautifully described under the similitude of the winter being passed, and the rain over and gone, the time of the singing of birds being come, and the voice of the turtle heard in our land. Bells for calling the faithful to prayers, and other holy ordinances of the Church, have been considered so important in Roman Catholic countries, that for several centuries past the right of consecration has been conferred on them by the dignitaries of the Church. That religion might not absorb the whole insignia of the town, the trade, which at that time was confined to fishing and curing salmon, came in for its share, and this circumstance gave rise to the idea of giving the salmon a place in the arms of the city.' The motto, which is said to have been in its original form ' Let Glasgow flourish by the preaching of the word,' traditionally takes its origin from a mound which the saint raised miraculously at the Dovehill E of the Cross, to enable him to get an elevation from which to preach to the crowd. Glasgow was to rise and Hourish as this mound had done. The motto does not, however, seem to have been in use previous to 1699. <P>The rest of the saint's life is little more than a record of the miracles he performed, not only in Strathclyde, but all over the country, his travels being widely extended, and on more than one occasion reaching as far as Rome, where he was kindly received by the Pope and confirmed in his bishopric. The one historic event of his later years appears to be his visit from Columba on the banks of the Molendinar about the year 584, when the saints interchanged their pastoral staves. His death took place probably in 612, and he was buried, according to the monkish chronicler, at the right hand side of the high altar of the cathedral. See the two Lives of St Kentigern edited by Bishop Forbes in vol. v. of <I>The Historians of Scotland</I> (Edinb. 1874), and vol. ii., pp. 197-198, of Dr Skene's <I>Celtic Scotland</I> (Edinb. 1877). <P>The successors of St Mungo are involved in obscurity, though no doubt the sanctity pertaining to the restingplace of the bones of so holy a man would for a time keep his establishment together, and help to increase the size of the village close by. It must have suffered, however, in the struggle against the supremacy of the Roman Church, and probably also in the commotions and strife produced by the incursions of the Danes, as well as in the contest in which the kingdom of Strathclyde disappeared and the country passed under the sway of the king of the Scots. Whatever the cause, so at least it was; and, just as in the case of Lichfield, the records of the see of Glasgow disappear for full 500 years. 'After St Mungo,' says M'Ure, a quaint early historian of Glasgow, ' for many ages the Episcopal see was overrun with heathenism and barbarity till the reign of Alexander I. ' When Alexander succeeded to the throne in 1107, he bestowed on his younger brother David, Prince of Cumbria, all the territory S of the Forth except the Lothians; and as David inherited all his mother's zeal for religion, he set himself to look after the spiritual condition of his subjects as vigorously as after their temporal welfare. The saintly character of St Mungo, and his connection with Glasgow, very soon attracted David's attention, and in 1115 he restored the see, and appointed his tutor and chaplain John (commonly called Achaius) the first of the new line of bishops. John, who was a man of learning and ability, as well as with considerable knowledge of the world, for he had travelled extensively on the Continent, was at first somewhat unwilling to accept the proffered promotion, but at last yielded to the prince's wishes, and was consecrated by Pope Paschal II., to whom he was well known. An inquisition ' concerning the lands belonging to the church of Glasgow, ' a copy of which exists in the chartulary of Glasgow, was made in 1120. In this it is set forth that ' various disturbances, everywhere arising, ' had ' not only destroyed the church and her possessions, but, wasting the whole country, driven the inhabitants into exile; ' and that the inhabitants, thus left to themselves, had followed the manners of the Gentiles and lived ' like brutes; ' but that now ' God sent unto them David as their prince,' who was to set this scandalous state of matters right, and who for that purpose had appointed John as their bishop. John, it goes on to say, was frightened at their barbarity and their abominable sins, but had been constrained by the Pope to enter upon the burdensome charge; and so the Prince had caused all the lands formerly belonging to the church of Glasgow to be found out and made over to the new bishop, that he might have sinews for his struggle with the wrong. The bishop had more trouble, too, than what merely arose from the condition of his see, for he got involved in a quarrel about church supremacy with the Archbishop of York, who claimed to be metropolitan of Scotland, and adduced in support of that claim a record (strongly, and with good cause, suspected of being a forgery) of three bishops of Glasgow consecrated at York in the 11th century. John resisted the York claims, and was so sorely tried that he quitted his see for the purpose of proceeding to the Holy Land. The Pope, however, ordered him to return, and 1124 found the good bishop not only settled again, but beginning to replace the primitive church of St Mungo by a statelier erection, of which some parts were of stone. The new cathedral was consecrated in presence of his royal patron, who was now King of Scotland, on 7 July 1136. The Prince had, on his accession to the throne, made large donations to the establishment, and he now further conferred on it the lands of Perdeyc [Partick], which still form part of the episcopal belongings, though they have passed into the hands of the University. According to the <I>Registrum Episcopatus Glasguensis,</I> ' the king, David I., gave to the church the land of Perdeyc [Partick], which was soon afterwards erected, along with the church of Guvan [Govan]. into a prebend of the cathedral. In addition to the long list of possessions* restored to Glasgow upon the verdict of the assize of inquest, this saintly King granted to the bishop the church of Renfrew; Guvan, with its church; the church of Cadihou [Cadzow]; the tithe of his cane or duties paid in cattle and swine throughout Strathgrif, Cuningham, Kyle, and Carrick; and the eighth penny of all pleas of court throughout Cumbria (which included the greater part of Scotland S of the Forth and Clyde, as well as the English county of Cumberland). The bishop also acquired the church of Lochorwort, near Borthwick in Lothian, from the Bishop of St Andrews, the King and Prince present and consenting.' David, the sainted son of St Margaret, was the greatest benefactor known in the annals of the see of Glasgow, and this is only one example of that liberality in gifting royal possessions to the Church which earned him from James VI. the character of 'ane sair sanct for the croon.' At the time of the consecration of the cathedral, ' the diocese was divided into two archdeaconries of Glasgow and Teviotdale, and for the first time there were appointed a dean, sub-dean, chancellor, treasurer, sacrist, chanter, and sub-chanter, all of whom had prebends settled upon them out of the gifts received from the King.' Bishop John died on 28 May 1147, after having held the see for the long period of thirty-two years. He was succeeded by Bishop Herbert, in whose time the strife with York was finally ended by Pope Alexander III., who decided that the only controlling power over the Church of Scotland was the see of Rome. He died in 1164, in which year also Malcolm IV. made proclamation that tithes were to be paid in the bishopric of Glasgow just as elsewhere. Herbert was succeeded by Ingram, who died in 1174; and was in turn succeeded by Joceline, abbot of the Cistercian monastery of Melrose, who was consecrated at Clairvaux, in France, on 1 June 1175, by Esceline, the Pope's legate. He is reputed on all hands to have been a worthy and liberal-minded prelate, and his actions prove him to have been one of the greatest, if not the greatest, of the occupants of the episcopal throne of Glasgow. Above all others ought he to be held in happy remembrance by the citizens of Glasgow, for, by a charter obtained from William the Lyon about 1180, the first start was given to the growth of Deschu into something more than a village. By this charter Glasgow was constituted a burgh of barony, holding of the bishop; and the King granted and confirmed ' to God and St Kentigern, and Joceline, Bishop of Glasgow, and all his successors for ever, that they shall hold a burgh at Glasgow, with a weekly market on Thursday, fully and freely, with all freedoms, liberties, and customs which any of my burghs throughout the whole of my kingdom enjoy.' Subsequently, about 1190, the bishop obtained for his burgh the further privilege of ' a fair to be kept at Glasgow, and to be held every year for ever, from the octave of the Apostles Peter and Paul, for the space of eight days complete, with ' the King's ' full protection, and with every freedom and all other liberties belonging and granted to fairs throughout the whole of ' his ' dominions, as fully and freely as all fairs are or ought to be held in any of' his ' dominions.' The octave of St Peter and St Paul fell on 6 July, and on that date the fair is still kept up with unfailing regularity, the only difference from the olden time being, that, instead of being held for business purposes, it is now characterised by the total want of it, Glasgow Fair being in those days the annual holidays, when labour is suspended and the industrious thousands enjoy a few days' recreation. While thus mindful of the temporal benefit of those under his charge, he was no less diligent in matters </FONT></DIV>
