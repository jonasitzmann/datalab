<b>About&nbsp;Foundation Degree in Story: Narrative and Communication (X390)          </b>
<br>
<br>
Stories define how we think, the way we feel and how we organise and understand the world. 
Our new foundation degree in Story: Narrative and Communication offers an opportunity for professional development for people who use storytelling, narrative and role play in a range of occupational settings. This work-based study programme has been developed with employers to provide relevant professional training for those working in libraries, cultural heritage, museums and galleries; community arts projects; schools, nurseries and after-school clubs; homes for senior citizens; public health; hospices; social inclusion; places of worship; community centres; prisons; radio and TV.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
<br>
<br>
The course will encourage you to interpret, inform and communicate in creative ways. You will learn how to use storytelling as a personal and professional skill, one that will help you to continue to reflect on your work and working environment, and enable you to transfer your skills to voluntary activity, such as community regeneration. The ethical issues that underlie storytelling will be addressed throughout the course. The taught element of the foundation degree is delivered on a part-time basis over a period of two years.  It includes the development of a learning journal and short courses covering a range of subjects related to the principles and practice of storytelling and its wider application.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
<br>
<br>
The degree has been designed as a series of building blocks in order that you may register for individual units of short-course continuing professional development. If you register for the whole programme you will take a number of compulsory subjects based on core competencies, and also choose from specialist topics appropriate to your sector. Topics covered will include traditional tales, creating new stories, undertaking reminiscence work, performance techniques, funding, compliance and community projects.
The course will be delivered through reflective work-based learning, so that you can continue to earn while you learn.  You will also use online learning to compile portfolios of work and engage in discussion with other students. This course gives you the opportunity to learn from specialists, to attend subject-specific short courses and allows employees to develop their skills through work-based study.                                                                               
<br>
<br>
In order to provide a supportive learning environment, students registering for this foundation degree will be asked to attend an induction programme. This will be delivered in the form of intensive tuition at Trinity & All Saints and will cover core skills, such as literacy and ICT, as well as give you the opportunity to meet other students and to start thinking about working with story.
