(1591)</font></p>

<hr>

<p align="left">The following letter was printed in 1591. The
volume in which it appears was entered in the Stationers'
Register to Thomas Dawson on 5 January 1591. It is now known in
only one surviving copy, at Shrewsbury School. The volume is not
listed in STC 1, and so has not been photographed by UMI, and
does not appear in the online ESTC. The entry in STC 2 follows:</p>

<p align="left">22533a.5<br>
A very godly letter made, by the right honourable sir Henry
Sidney. Now XXV. yeeres past vnto Phillip Sidney his sonne then
at schoole at Shrowesbury. (The epitaph of sir H. Sidney. [By] W.
Gruffith. [In verse.]) 8<sup>o</sup>. T. Dawson, 1591.</p>

<p align="left">The original manuscript letter has not survived,
but there is no reason to doubt the authenticity of the printed
text. The title further tells us that the letter is 'most
necessarie for all yoong gentlemen to bee carried in memorie,
being put in print at the humble request of one William Gruffith
of Coredaney, in the Countie of Angles, sometime clarke of his
[i.e. Henry Sidney's] kitchen'. The text below is taken from
Butler's <em>Sidneiana</em>, pp. 3-5. The letter was first
printed in that other great collection of Sidney family
documents, <em>Letters and Memorials of State</em>, ed. Arthur
Collins, 2 vols (London: T. Osborne, 1746). The letter also
appears, in a modernised text, in M.W. Wallace, <em>The Life of
Sir Philip Sidney</em> (Cambridge, 1915), pp. 68-70, and was
published again in a limited edition, <em>A very godly letter</em>...
(Oxford: University Press, John Johnson, 1929).</p>

<p align="left">Sidney was born in 1554 and attended Shrewsbury
School for several years from 1564; this tallies with the title
page statement indicating a date of 1565/66.</p>

<p>Sonne <i>Phillip</i> I haue receiued two letters from you, the
one written in Latine, the other in French, which I take in good
parte, and will you to exercise that practise of learning often,
for it will stand you in most steed in that profession of lyfe
that you are borne to liue in. And now sithence this is my first
letter that euer I did write to you, I will not that it be all
empty of some aduices, which my naturall care of you prouoketh me
to wish you to follow, as documentes to you in this your tender
age. Let your first action be the lifting vp your minde to
almighty God by hartie praier, and feelingly digest the wordes
you speake in praier with continuall meditation, and thinking of
him to whom you pray, &amp; vse this as an ordinarie and at an
ordinarie houre, whereby the time it selfe will put you in
remembrance to doo that thing which you are accustomed to doo in
that time. Apply your studie such houres as your discreet Master
doth assigne you earnestly, and the time I know hee will so limit
as shalbe both sufficient for your learning, yea &amp; salfe for
your health; and marke the sence and matter of that you doo reade
aswell as the words, so shall you both enrich your tongue with
wordes, and your wit with matter, and iudgement wil grow, as
yeares groweth in you. Be humble and obedient to your master, for
vnlesse you frame your self to obey others, yea and feele in your
selfe what obedience is, you shall neuer be able to teach others
how to obey you. Be courteous of gesture, and affable vnto all
men, with diuersitie of reuerence according to the dignitie of
the person, there is nothing that winneth so much with so little
cost, vse moderate diet, so as after your meale you may find your
wit fresher and not more duller, and your body more liuely and
not more heauie, seldome drinke wine, and yet somtimes do, least
being inforced to drinke vpon the sudden you should find your
selfe inflamed, vse exercise of bodie, but such as is without
perill of your bones or ioints, it will increase your force and
enlarge your breath, delite to bee cleanly aswell in all parts of
your body as in your garments, it shall make you gratefull in
each company and otherwise lothsome, giue your selfe to be merie,
for you degenerate from your father if you find not your selfe
most able in wit and bodie, to do any thing when you be most
merie, but let your mirth be euer void of all scurrillitie &amp;
biting words to any man, for an wound giuen by a worde is
oftentimes harder to bee cured then that which is giuen with the
sword: be you rather a hearer &amp; bearer away of other mens
talke, then a beginner or procurer of spech, otherwise you shalbe
accompted to delite to heare your self speake. Be modest in ech
assemblie, &amp; rather be rebuked of light felowes for
maidenlike shamefastnes, then of your sad friends for peart
boldnes: think vpon euery worde that you will speake before you
vtter it, and remember how nature hath rampered vp as it were the
tongue with teeth, lips, yea and haire without the lips, and all
betokening raines and bridles to the lesse vse of that member,
aboue all things tell no vntruth, no not in trifles, the custome
of it is nought: And let it not satisfie you that the hearers for
a time take it for a truth, yet after it will be knowne as it is
to your shame, for there cannot be a greater reproch to a
Gentleman then to be accompted a lyer. Study and endeuour your
selfe to be vertuously occupied, so shall you make such an habite
of well doing in you, as you shall not know how to do euill
though you would: Remember my Sonne the Noble bloud you are
discended of by your mothers side, &amp; thinke that only by
vertuous life and good action, you may be an ornament to that
ylustre family, and otherwise through vice &amp; sloth you may be
accompted <i>Labes generis</i>, a spot of your kin, one of the
greatest cursses that can happen to man. Well my little <i>Phillip</i>
this is enough for me and I feare to much for you, but yet if I
finde that this light meat of digestion, do nourish any thing the
weake stomack of your yoong capacitie, I will as I finde the same
grow stronger, feede it with tougher food. Commend mee most
hartily vnto Maister Iustice Corbet, old Master Onslowe, and my
Coosin his sonne. Farewell, your mother and I send you our
blessings, and almighty God graunt you his, nourish you with his
feare, gouerne you with his grace, and make you a good seruant to
your Prince and Countrey.</p>

A post script by my Lady <i>Sidney</i>,<br>
<i>in the skirts of my L. Presidents letter,<br>
</i>to her sayd Sonne <i>Phillip.</i></font></p>

<p>Your Noble and carefull Father hath taken paynes with his owne
hand, to giue you in this his letter, so wise, so learned, and
most requisite precepts for you to follow, with a diligent and
humble thankefull minde, as I will not withdrawe your eies from
beholding and reuerent honoring the same: No, not so long time as
to read any letter from me, and therefore at this time I will
write vnto you no other letter then this, wherby I first blesse
you, with my desire to God to plant in you his grace, and
secondarily warne you to haue alwaies before the eyes of your
mind, these excellent counsailes of my Lord your deere Father,
and that you fayle not continually once in foure or fiue daies to
reade them ouer. And for a finall leaue taking for this time, see
that you shewe your selfe as a louing obedient Scholer to your
good Maister, to gouerne you yet many yeeres, and that my Lord
and I may heare that you profite so in your learning, as thereby
you may encrease our louing care of you, and deserue at his
handes the continuance of his great ioy, to haue him often
witnesse with his own hande the hope he hath in your well doing.
Farewell my little <i>Phillip</i>, and once againe the Lord
blesse you.</p>
