<h2>Cryogenic sub-systems testing: The Cold Optics Chamber (COC)</h2>

<p>The requirement for test and calibration facilities may be considered
a key component in the design and development of space
instrumentation.  Frequently, calibration facilities are purpose-built
for a single instrument, adding significantly to the overall programme
costs and schedule requirements. This is particularly true for
calibration under thermal balance, where the instrument's geometry and
mission-specific thermal requirements strongly dictate the cold wall
design and supporting cooling systems.</p>

<p>While large assemblies, or whole instruments, will generally
require complex and costly test and calibration facilities this is
frequently not the case for instrumentation comprising small
sub-assemblies, such as the cooled focal plane array of a telescope,
where the requirement to simulate thermal loading under operational
conditions may be met with more modest equipment. For such
sub-systems, therefore, the availability of versatile and
easily-configured test environments should convey many benefits, not
least of all reduced costs and a shorter processing time. It was these
considerations that lead to the design and construction of the Cold
Optics Chamber (COC) which is located in the department's <a
href="clean_assembly_area.html">Clean Assembly Area</a>, along with
the <a href="space_view_chamber.html">Space View Chamber</a> and the
<a href="thermal_cycling_chamber.html">Thermal Cycling
Chamber</a>.</p>

<p>The COC comprises a cylindrical, 1 metre diameter stainless steel vacuum
vessel orientated vertically (centreline along the g-vector) and divided
into two unequal parts. The lower, smaller end-cap section is fixed to the
chamber support frame while the upper cylindrical section may be raised or
lowered using a mechanical hoist. The hoist has been designed to permit
rotation about its centreline so that the top chamber section may be swung
away from the centreline of the lower section. This arrangement provides
excellent access to the interior of the chamber while ensuring efficient
use of the available working volume.</p>

<p>The fixed end-cap section is fitted with a <strong>Leybold 340M
turbomolecular pump</strong> and a <strong>Leybold CoolPower 130 cold
head</strong>, along with <strong>multiple electrical-vacuum
feedthroughs</strong>, vacuum gauges and a <strong>residual gas
analyser</strong>.  Concentric tripods, comprising low thermal
conductivity struts, centre and support three concentric aluminium
interface plates (Fig&#160;1 and Fig&#160;2). The middle annular and
the central circular interface plates are connected to the first and
second stages of the cold head via flexible copper cooling straps. An
outer annular interface plate completes the COC's 'optical bench
assembly' with multiple tapped holes providing a convenienet and
versatile method of mounting test equipment to the 15&#160;K (circular
inner), 70&#160;K (annular middle) and room temperature (annular
outer) temperature zones of the assembly.</p>

<p>The flexible cooling straps minimise, but do not totally eliminate,
the mechanical vibrations exported from the cold head and accommodate
dimensional changes during cool-down. The three temperature controlled
interface plates are supported at approximately the same height above
floor level as optical benches on an adjacent optical table and on
which may be mounted test and calibration equipment (Fig&#160;3).

<p>Control of each 'temperature zone' is achieved by balancing cooling
power (cold head) and heating power (power resistors) at the
operational set-point temperature. For additional control, the cooling
power of the cold head may be adjusted in the range 75 to 135&#160;3W
by varying the frequency of the displacer (stepper motor controlled;
40 to 70&#160;3Hz). The thermal resistances of the cooling straps have
been sized so that the complete optical bench assembly may be
temperature controlled at 290&#160;3K with the cold head displacer
running at its lowest frequency (minimium cooling power).  This
arangement minimises the heater power requirements for 'hot operation'
while maximising the cooling power (70&#160;3Hz displacer frequency)
at the lowest temperatures.</p>

<p>The Cold Optics Chamber is also used to cool a <strong>White
cell</strong> (Fig&#160;4) which is itself being used to study
absorption by gases as a function of pressure, temperature and
wavelength. The White cell contains an arrangement of three mirrors
which, by multiple reflections, simulate absorption paths comparable
to those encountered in real atmospheres. As part of the experimental
configuration, a monochromatic beam of infrared radiation from a
medium resolution spectrometer is passed into the cell through
sapphire windows. The windows are fitted to both the vacuum chamber
and the cooled White cell, while the spectrometer is supported on the
optical bench adjacent to the vacuum chamber. After multiple
reflections the emerging beam is analysed and the degree of absoption
determined for the prevailing conditions.</p>

<p>The cell has been designed to safely hold explosive and corrosive
gases, such as methane and ammonia, and at high pressures (up to
5&#160;bar) and at low temperatures (down to 100&#160;K). The thermal
design ensures good temperature uniformity (gradients less than
1&#160;K), which is of particular importance when working with gases
near their boiling point (e.g. ammonia). For high resolution
spectroscopy over more extensive conditions the department uses the <a
href="http://www.msf.rl.ac.uk/">Molecular Spectroscopy Facility</a> at
the Rutherford Appleton Laboratory.</p>
