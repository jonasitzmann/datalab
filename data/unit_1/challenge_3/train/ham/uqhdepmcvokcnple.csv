The RSGS was founded in 1884 as an educational trust, and education is still a fundamental remit of the Society.

Through lectures, symposia, education packs, support for geography-teaching in Scotland's schools and universities, and close liaison with government, the Society promotes the quality and growth of geographical and environmental education in Scotland.
</p>
<p align=justify>
The RSGS works closely with the <a href="http://www.sagt.org.uk/">Scottish Association of Geography Teachers (SAGT)</a> in promoting the teaching of geography in schools. &nbsp; In particular, the Society supports keynote speakers at the annual SAGT conference, the Students World Wise Quiz, the John Bartholomew Essay Competition (see also below), and the production of educational resources.
