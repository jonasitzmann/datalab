			<P>The purpose of these intranet pages is to provide information on school buildings, asset management plans, maintenance and other related topics. We hope it will become a useful central resource for schools on property issues.</P>
<P>With the further delegation of building maintenance in April 2002 and the provision of devolved formula capital, schools have an increased role in the management of their premises. For Voluntary Aided (VA) Schools amendments were made to funding arrangements and responsibilities through the Regulation Reform Act 2002.</P>
<P>Guidance and support will be offered to help schools make informed decisions about prioritising investment in school premises. Information will also be available as an indication of the issues that should be considered when carrying out or planning work to buildings or associated services.</P>
<P>Schools will be able to access 'key documents' such as the LEA's Asset Management Plan, guidance notes for grants such as Devolved Formula Capital as well as suggested useful links for those seeking additional information.</P>
