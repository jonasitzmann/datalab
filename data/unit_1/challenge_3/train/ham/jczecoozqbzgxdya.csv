<p>
On a fundamental level, a vertical slice through the atmosphere of a
planet can be divided into three distinct regions. At the lowest level,
the troposphere and stratosphere, an atmosphere consists of a dynamic
mixture of neutral gases. In contrast, at the very outer extremity, an
atmosphere consists entirely of charged particles. This plasma
environment is known as the magnetosphere (for planets with a magnetic
field), a region characterised by the interaction of the planets
atmosphere with the high velocity stream of charged particles from the
sun, known as the solar wind. Sandwiched in between is a transition
region in which both the neutral gases of the lower atmosphere, and the
charged particles of the outer atmosphere, co-exist.  This region is the
ionosphere-thermosphere.  At the Atmospheric Physics Laboratory,
University College London, sophisticated computational models of the
global ionosphere-thermosphere system have been developed for the planets
Earth, Mars, Jupiter, and Titan. In addition, recent developments have
been concerned with the modelling of Saturn (in readiness for the arrival
of the Cassini spacecraft in 2004) and also Jovian-like exoplanets.
My talk will describe how three-dimensional, time dependent, modelling of
these systems provides invaluable insights into the underlying physical
processes at work. It will focus on our comparative planetology approach
in which the aim is to gain a better understanding by investigating the
similarities and differences of the
various systems.
