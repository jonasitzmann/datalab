<h2>The University of Oxford's role in EUMETSAT Collaboration </h2>
The EUropean organisation for the exploitation of METeorological SATellites (EUMETSAT) is an independent intergovernmental organisation created in 1986 with prime objective to establish, maintain and exploit European systems of operational meteorological satellites.  
<p>
For this project EUMETSAT have asked that the Atmospheric, Oceanic and Planetary Physics (AOPP) subdepartment of the University of Oxford Physics Department prepare, implement and document modifications to the Optimal Cloud Analysis (OcA) prototype code to include the simultaneous retrieval of aerosol optical thickness and effective radius. The ultimate aim for EUMETSAT is to apply these retrievals to the VIS 0.6, 0.8 and NIR 1.6 um channels of the MSG SEVIRI satellite instrument. 
<p>
The retrieval developed by AOPP is to use the Optimal Estimation (OE) technique.
