   <P>The "Gazetteer for Scotland" was conceived by Bruce Gittings of the
   <A HREF="/home/geoghome.html">Department of Geography, University of
   Edinburgh</a> and David Munro of the <A HREF="/~rsgs/">Royal Scottish
   Geographical Society</a> as a major development to promote understanding of the
   Geography of Scotland.  The Gazetteer is also a significant historical,
   cultural, architectural and environmental resource, which aims to connect 
   Scotland's people with places.  It is aimed both at 
   the local Scottish community, and at an international audience.</P>
   <P>The intention was to develop a comprehensive geographical
   database for Scotland, accessible via the World-Wide Web.</P>
   <P>Whilst high quality geographic information has gained widespread acknowledgment
   as an important resource, in 1995 when this project began there was 
   a dearth of information
   available on Scotland. Until the late 19th Century, Scotland maintained a
   strong tradition of quality geographical directories and gazetteers but nothing
   comparable has been produced during the 20th Century. With the advent of the
   information super-highway and advances made in computer database management systems, the
   tools which exist today, it was possible to produce a relatively cost-effective and easily updateable
   <i>Gazetteer for Scotland</i>, which can be accessed by millions. In addition 
   this approach allows a more flexible form of map-based browsing of
   information through interactive multi-media, which is not possible in a paper
   based medium.</P>
   <P>Data and additional functions have been progressively added to
   the <i>Gazetteer for Scotland</i> to provide an easy to use on-line data
   source, incorporating a substantial body of text,
   photographs, maps, video, sounds and including word search and a range of
   other query facilities.  The Gazetteer database contains information on
   towns, villages, rivers, bens, glens,
   tourist attractions, historic buildings and sites, family names,
   famous people, statistical information and business data
   from the Scottish Borders to the
   Northern Isles.</P>
   <P>The Gazetteer for Scotland has
   received generous funding from the <I><B>Robertson Trust</B></I> and the
   <I><B>Carnegie Trust for the Universities of Scotland</B></I>, which has
   allowed a basic system to be built and the first tranche of data collected.</P>
   <p>There is however, a lot more work to be completed, and already we have a
   long list of new connections we would like to make and additional data we would
   wish to integrate.  Thus if you like what you
   see, please consider either donating or 
   <A HREF="#sponsor">becoming a sponsor of the <i>Gazetteer for Scotland</i>
   project</a>.</P>

   <H3><A NAME="What_is">What is a Gazetteer</A></H3><FONT SIZE=-1>
   <P>The term gazetteer is derived from
   the Latin <I>Gazetta</I> to mean broadly, a geographical
   dictionary. The popularity of gazetteers started in Britain in the
   16th Century and reached a peak by the 19th Century, with a large
   number of publishing houses producing detailed topographical
   directories. Typically, place names would be listed alphabetically
   with each entry including its grid reference, population,
   contextual location, main industries and for larger places, a
   short paragraph containing associated points of interest, famous
   people and historical events. The interest in gazetteers can be
   correlated with the imperial expansion of the time and an
   increased knowledge and fascination for foreign lands.
   The gazetteer was a highly revered reference publication and
   enjoyed the status and popularity of a dictionary or an
   encyclopaedia, as this quote from the Imperial Gazetteer (1855)
   suggests;</P>
   <BLOCKQUOTE><I>&quot;Next to a good
   dictionary, the most generally useful book is a good gazetteer&quot;</I>
   <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
   &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

   &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
   -- W.G. Blackie (1855)</BLOCKQUOTE>
   <P>However, during the 20th Century the
   gazetteer became less fashionable partly due to the rapid changes
   in political boundaries, particularly in Europe and hence the need
   for almost continual, expensive updates and perhaps also partly
   due to a plethora of tourist guide books which, however, provide
   only part of the information and function of a good gazetteer. Today, the skills and
   expertise necessary to produce a quality gazetteer are
   correspondingly scarce.</P>

   <P>The last fully comprehensive Scottish
   Gazetteer was the <i>Ordnance Gazetteer of Scotland</i> compiled in 1885
   edited by Francis Groome, which incredibly remains the standard
   geographical reference text on Scotland to be found in major libraries. 
   The only topographical directories for Scotland produced
   this Century have been place-name lists published by the Ordnance
   Survey and the Registrar General for Scotland and the Johnston's
   Gazetteer of Scotland (last updated 1973) which is limited in
   content and now out of print.</P>
   <P>There is however, a current
   resurgence of interest in producing a comprehensive Gazetteer for
   Scotland driven by Dr. David Munro (Editor of the Oxford
   Dictionary of the World and Chambers World Gazetteer), Bruce Gittings
   (a specialist in Geographical Information at the University of Edinburgh)
   and the
   Royal Scottish Geographical Society in order to address the dearth
   of up-to-date geographical information on Scotland.</P>

   <P>The &quot;Gazetteer for Scotland&quot;
   is a major research project, which has already taken a significant
   number of years to achieve what you see today. However, it will probably
   never be complete because of the ongoing need for regular significant 
   updates. This
   Gazetteer is already the most significant resource of Scottish
   information available online. We intend that it should be freely
   accessible internationally and, unlike a book-based gazetteer, it
   will retain a historical record of information through time.</P>
   <P>The only way that this project can continue to be
   successful and be kept up-to-date will be if we can raise the necessary 
   funding. 
   Individuals can help with a donation, however small. Corporate bodies can
   help us and promote themselves through sponsorship.
   Sponsors will benefit from exposure to a very large number of
   users of the gazetteer; currently around 250,000 access per
   week and growing by the month. Sponsors will have their
   name included on every gazetteer page, links to their own &quot;home
   page&quot; and etc.</P>
   <P>We are also willing to licence the use of the <i>Gazetteer for
   Scotland</i> database on other web-sites. Entries include considerable
   descriptive text, a map reference,
   associated statistics, potentially at least one photograph and can be
   easily linked to your own site. Pages can be prepared in your own 'house
   style' with your advertising or links. They can include customised content
   from the large number of database fields we hold and be provided to you in 
   a ready-to-use format. We can also provide regular updates as required.
   Applications include community web sites, estate agency, relocation,
   tourism, directory services and many others. You won't find a more
   comprehensive description of Scotland.</P>
   <P>If you would like more information on these opportunities, please 
   contact Bruce Gittings (<A HREF="mailto:bruce@geo.ed.ac.uk">bruce@geo.ed.ac.uk</A>).
