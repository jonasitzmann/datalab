  <h1 align="center">About the Tripos </h1>
  <img height="272" alt="Faerie Queene page" hspace="10"

  <p>There are two main examinations in the English Tripos, known as Part I and Part II. It is possible to take only one part of the Tripos in English and to take the other part in another subject. Most students find, however, that Part I gives them the broad basis of historical knowledge to enable them to make informed choices about their options in Part II. </p>
  <h2>Part I </h2>
  <p>Part I is designed to give a general foundation in the study of English Literature, life and thought in the period from 1300 to the present day. It occupies the first two years of the course.</p>
  <p>There are four main period papers in Part I:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>1300-1550 </strong></li>
    <li><strong>1500-1700 </strong></li>
    <li><strong>1688-1847 </strong></li>
    <li><strong>1830-Present </strong></li>
  </ul>
  <p>Some candidates also opt to take the early medieval paper (1066-1350).</p>
  <p>Each paper invites wide and intensive reading. It is possible to study a particular writer in some detail, or to relate his or her work to that of other writers. Students might work on a particular topic (death or money, perhaps), and study different literary treatments of it, or they might work on how a particular genre changes in the course of a period, or they might just work on one major author. There is a great deal of freedom to develop your own interests.</p>
  <p>Part 1 also includes a paper exclusively devoted to Shakespeare, and a paper on Literary Criticism. This paper includes a section devoted to Practical Criticism, as well as providing an opportunity to work on the history and theory of Literary Criticism. Some of the approaches to literature explored in this paper are illustrated by practical examples in <a href="../vclass/index.htm">the Virtual Classroom</a>. </p>
  <p>There is also a paper on<b> European Languages and Literatures</b>, which gives undergraduates a chance either to develop their understanding of a language they have studied at A-Level, or to learn a new language altogether. A wide range of modern and ancient languages can be studied (e.g. Old English, French, German, Italian, Latin, Greek). There is a strong emphasis on the literary aspects of the language studied, and the set texts for each language are chosen because they have had a major influence on English literature. Students may take a paper on <b>Language for Literature, 1300-present</b> as an alternative to the language paper, so it is not essential to have a particular skill in a foreign language in order to take Part I. Candidates also have the option of writing an open dissertation on any topic in English Literature and its contexts, 1300-present. </p>
  <p>Examinations at Cambridge have traditionally taken the form of three hour examination papers. The majority of both Parts I and II is examined in this way. The English Faculty, however, has pioneered various different forms of assessment. It is possible to submit a <b>dissertation</b> of 5,000 words in place of one of the period papers for Part I. It is also possible to submit a portfolio of three essays in place of another paper, although candidates may not offer an open dissertation falling primarily within the same period as that for which the portfolio is offered. These options allow students to work in depth on particular authors or fields which interest them. Part I can sometimes feel like a gallop through a vast range of material, but at every stage it is possible to slow down and focus on a topic of particular interest to you. </p>
  <p>In both parts of the Tripos it is possible to submit<b> original compositions</b>, which could be critical or creative writings. These can play a part in the overall assessment of a student's performance in the Tripos, although they can only pull a candidate's performance up.</p>
  <h2>Part II </h2>
  <p>Part II is taken in the third year. The only two compulsory elements are a paper on <b>Practical Criticism</b> and a paper on <b>Tragedy</b>. The<b> Tragedy paper</b> requires work on Greek Tragedy and on Shakespearean Tragedy, as well inviting exploratory work on a vast range of dramatic and non-dramatic material from the fifth century BC to the present day. It is possible to work on novels, films, lyrical and narrative poems, as well as a range of dramatic material extending from Aeschylus to Ibsen, Beckett and Tony Harrison.</p>
  <p>In addition to the compulsory papers students submit a <b>dissertation </b>of 7,500 words on any topic within English Literature, and two further elements.</p>
  <p>Students may also submit a second dissertation and one optional paper, or they may choose to take two<b> optional papers</b>. </p>
  <p>The<b> optional papers</b> change from time to time. They usually include papers on: </p>
  <ul>
    <li>American Literature</li>
    <li>The History and Theory of Literary Criticism</li>
    <li>Contemporary Writing in English: 1979 to the present</li>
    <li>The English Moralists (which can include European philosophers going back to ancient Greece) </li>
    <li>Commonwealth and International Literature in English</li>
    <li>Papers on special periods of English Literature (for example 1847-1872) </li>
    <li>Papers on major authors, such as Chaucer or Wordsworth</li>
  </ul>
  <p>It is also possible to 'borrow' optional papers from other Departments or Faculties, such as <a href="http://www.mml.cam.ac.uk/">Modern and Medieval Languages</a>, or the <a href="http://www.asnc.cam.ac.uk/">Department of Anglo-Saxon, Norse and Celtic</a>. </p>
