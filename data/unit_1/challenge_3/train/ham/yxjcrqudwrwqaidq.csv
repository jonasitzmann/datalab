  <p> "Shakespearean Beauty Marks" argues that the cultural ideal of beauty in the Renaissance was essentially featureless. That is, the celebration of beauty, rooted in a theory of harmony, was sharply distinct from the art of identification. Shakespeare endorsed the ideal repeatedly in his work, but his deep attraction, aesthetic and erotic, was for odd, highly individuated forms of beauty. <br />
