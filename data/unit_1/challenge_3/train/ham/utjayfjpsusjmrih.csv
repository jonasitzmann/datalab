<br>
<br>
This full time course provides professional development for those who work with children and young people. The programme is designed to develop skills through integrated academic and work-based learning. In particular, it is aimed at teaching assistants and others who support learning in educational and childcare settings.

The taught element is delivered one afternoon session (1.30-7.00pm) per term-time week (normally over two years). The majority of your development and learning will take place in the workplace.

The six (20 credit) modules offered at Level One provide a broad base for the development of professional knowledge and understanding for those working in an educational context. Those offered at Level Two offer more focused opportunities including the development of some specialised interests. All modules draw upon the working contexts and experiences of the students throughout and are relevant to supporting learning in a range of age phases and educational contexts, including special schools.
