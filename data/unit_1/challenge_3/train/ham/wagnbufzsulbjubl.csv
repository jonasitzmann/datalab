<center> <h1> Satellite Observation of Aviation Impacts on the UTLS</h1>
   <p><hr>

<p> The well being of humanity relies on the environment in which we
live, for example the atmosphere sustains the eco-system providing
thermal insulation and protection from shortwave radiation. The region
of the atmosphere from about 8-26 km comprising the upper troposphere
and lower stratosphere (UTLS) plays a major role in the atmosphere's
climate and on the surface environment, for example, changes in ozone
in the lower startosphere have a large impact on the surface UV
flux. Hence safeguarding the atmosphere from degradation is required
for our continued existence.

<p> Aerosols are particles ranging in size from 10^-3 to 30 micron and
are produced by natural processes (e.g. volcanic dust, smoke from
natural forest fires, condensation of atmopsheric gases) as well as by
human activities. The primary anthropogenic aerosols include particles
directly emitted during the combustion processes and indirectly formed
from gases emitted during combustion.

<p> In the 1970s, plans to build a large fleet of high-flying
supersonic aircraft led to concerns that their exhaust emissions could
cause a reduction in stratospheric ozone (Crutzen, 1971). In the end,
only a small number of supersonic passenger aircraft were built, and
attention switched to other possible causes of ozone
depletion. However, in recent years, the growth in the number of
long-haul subsonic passenger aircarft, and the projection for further
expansion in the future, has reawakened a general concern for the
effects of aircraft on the atmosphere. Specific concerns are the
significance of emissions of H2O (an important greenhouse gas whose
budget is poorly understood), NOx and aerosols on the radiative and
chemical properties of the UTLS.

<p> Present generation of aircraft passenger fleet spends a significant
part of its time at cruise altitude within the lower stratosphere
(WMO, 1992). As a result, the injection of chemically active compounds
(NOx and H2O) and aerosol precursors (SO2 and Hydrocarbons) directly
into the stratosphere could lead to ozone depletion (Brasseur,
1998). The forecast average growth rate of aricraft movement is about
5% per year (Schumann, 19994) so that even larger anthropogenic
perturbations of the UTLS might be expected in the future.


<p> Some of the most poorly understood processes associated with
aircraft emissions are the heterogeneous reactions. The rate of these
reactions is determined by the type and size distribution of aerosol
particles which in turn are determined by the aerosols chemical and
thermal history.

<p> This study will focus on emissions at cruise altitude (i.e. in the
lower atmosphere) as this is where aircraft spent significant part of
their time and because the aircraft enhancement of the aerosol loading
in the stratosphere will be typically 100 times greater than in the
troposphere. The project will include the formulation of a detailed
aerosol microphysical model in a chemical transport model of the
stratopshere. The resulting model will be used to simulate the
evolution of startospheric aerosol properties including aircraft
emission.

 


<h1>Scientific objectives of the project</h1>
The two major science aims of the project are:
<p>

<li> To predict changes in the stratospheric composition caused by the
release of aerosols and gases by aircraft, and

<li> to observe these changes using satellite data<br>

<h1>These can be divided into five objectives:</h1>
<li> Parameterisation of the local effects of aircraft emission<br> 
<p>

The local change in atmospheric state (trace gas composition, aerosol type and size distribution) caused by an aircraft must be estimated as a function of fule type and amoun burnt and then rescaledto the size of an atmospheric model grid box.
<p>
<li> To develop a Fast Aerosol Microphysical Model for UTLS (FAMMUS)<br>

<p> The evolution of aerosols will be decribed by FAMMUS which will be
size and composition resolved computer model that will include
aerosols microphysical processes (nucleation, condensation,
evaporation, coalescence and sedimentation).

<p>
<li> To insert FAMMUS into SLIMCAT <br>

<p> The FAMMUS model will be coupled with SLIMCAT so that local
changes in aircraft emission, humidty and temperature (as prescribed
in the SLIMCAT model) will give rise to related changes in aerosol
heterogeneous chemistry.

<p> <li> To use SLIMCAT to identify chemical changes in a 2000
atmosphere that may be attributed to pollution from aircraft<br>

<p> SLIMCAT will be run for a 2000 atmosphere both including and
excluding emissions. The differences in the model output will be used
to identify the regions of the atmosphere that displays the strongest
response to aircraft emissions.

<p>
<li> To investigate satellite data for the predicted changes due to aircraft pollution

<p> SAGEII, MIPAS and HIRDLES data will be used to examine those
regions of the atmosphere which display the strongest response to the
aircraft emissions.
