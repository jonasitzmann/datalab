<strong>INTRODUCTION</strong>

<p>

When CERES started in October 1996 its managers prepared a series

of guides to electronic resources. These guides have been edited,

truncated, and amalgamated into this one. This document is

designed to work alongside the HARVEST Digests, the first of

which was produced after HARVEST I.vi in June 1997.  <cite>NB</cite> Much of the information below has been digested from the sources described, and often retains their wording.

<p>

<strong>CONTENTS</strong>

<p>

<h2 align=center>BIDS (Bath Information and Data Services)</h2>

<p>

The Bottom Line At The Top: BIDS is very useful indeed. Dry

descriptions can tell you far less than an hour's exploring.

<p>

Access: BIDS requires users to register and thereby obtain a

password. How this is done depends on your institution: in Cambridge, for instance, just ask at the central desk of the UL reading room.

<p>

What's there: several databases of which the most relevant one is the

Arts and Humanities section of the BIDS - ISI database. This

includes a vast collection of journal articles. There is also a

Social Sciences Database. The special feature

of BIDS is that it is a citation index as well as a bibliography,

i.e. for every article you retrieve there is a full list of all

the works cited in its notes. This can often speed up the process

of finding relevant secondary material. BIDS also offers a

service whereby you can order copies of articles from the British Library.

<p>

Getting there: BIDS has a website at<a href=http://www.bids.ac.uk/> http://www.bids.ac.uk/</a> from which you can link to ISI using, for example, Netscape. It also

has a telnet connection at <a href=telnet:bids.ac.uk>telnet bids.ac.uk</a>. Telnet is a very

common program which pretty much any networked computer will

have. It has numerous forms but generally typing bids.ac.uk

either at the relevant prompt, or having used the Connect menu,

will do the trick.

<p>

Searching: Basic searches on the web version are performed by

selecting the Easy Search Form and filling in the boxes. If

you've reached BIDS via telnet then you'll have to choose a few

numbered options from menus in order to reach the search screen.

There are numerous refinements of the search process possible and

CERES strongly suggests a careful reading of the HELP sections of

BIDS in order to get the best out of it.

<p>

Viewing Search Results: again, this can be simple or more refined

and the HELP sections are the best way to exploit the

capabilities of BIDS fully.

<h2 align=center>OCLC FirstSearch <strong>(including MLA Bibliography)</strong></h2>

<p>
FirstSearch is a selected package of reference databases hosted in Ohio by OCLC Inc., with a mirror site in the UK. The databases are a combination of OCLC's proprietary services plus specialised databases from other producers. Searching is free to end-users who are members of subscribing institutions (though there may be charges for associated services such as printed guides and document delivery).
<p>
FirstSearch can be reached via telnet or via the web. Telnet access (UK only) via the NISS gateway at <a href=telnet:wwwx25.niss.ac.uk>telnet://wwwx25.niss.ac.uk</a> (follow the menu to 'Data services requiring registration'). Better, though, is the web interface. Follow links from your Institution's library, or go direct to <a href=http://homer.uk.oclc.org/>http://homer.uk.oclc.org/</a> or (US/Canada) <a href=http://www.oclc.org/>http://www.oclc.org/</a>.

<p>

FirstSearch comprises the following databases:
<ul>

<li>WORLDCAT is the OCLC online union catalogue, containing more than 27 million records describing items on all subjects, with coverage dating from about AD 1000. It does not include entries for individual journal articles or book chapters. 

<li>ARTICLEFIRST contains records describing items listed on the contents page of individual issues of more than 11,000 journals in science, technology, medicine, social science, business, the humanities, and popular culture. Coverage starts in 1990, and many records contain abstracts. 
<li>CONTENTSFIRST contains the complete table of contents page from individual issues of more than 11,000 journals in science, technology, medicine, social science, business, the humanities, and popular culture. Coverage includes all the titles included in the British Library's Inside Information service, and dates from 1990.
<li>ALSO:

<ul>
<li>PapersFirst

<li>ProceedingsFirst

</ul>Well, you're getting the picture now, aren't you?

</ul>
Also now available online via OCLC is the long-running (and, we hope, known to you all) MLA Bibliography. Follow the link to the Arts and Humanities Database Area.

<p>
<cite>For more information on OCLC, please see recent coverage in Harvest III.iii <a href=arch-3-3.htm>here</a>.</cite>

<h2 align=center>OTHER DATABASES</h2>

<p>

<cite>NB The Cambridge University server can send you on your way to a whole

range of databases and service via a handy start page: <a href=http://www.cam.ac.uk/AcadInfoRes>http://www.cam.ac.uk/AcadInfoRes</a>. </cite>

<p>

<strong>NISS Gateway</strong><br>

The NISS gateway at <a href=http://www.niss.ac.uk/> http://www.niss.ac.uk/ </a> is a gateway to academic resources aimed at the UK. From here you can gather info

about, and then link to, a wide range of databases and services. Presumably the service will expand.

<p>

<strong>HENSA Service</strong><br>

MUCH free software (of a very grown-up kind) available via the

HENSA service (particularly the MICROS section). Web yourself

over to <a href=http://www.hensa.ac.uk> http://www.hensa.ac.uk</a> if you want to download copies of handy applications etc.

<p>

<strong>HUMBUL Gateway</strong><br>

The HUMBUL gateway at the following address:

<a href=http://users.ox.ac.uk/humbul/> http://users.ox.ac.uk/humbul/</a>

opens the way to a wide range of Net features.

<p>

<strong>Institute of Historical Research</strong><br>

Betake yourself to <a href=http://ihr.sas.ac.uk> http://ihr.sas.ac.uk </a> for the Institute of Historical Research's guide to web resources etc.

<h2 align=center>INTERNET SITES</h2>

<p>

<strong>STARTING POINTS</strong><br>

<ul>

<li>EARLY MODERN LITERARY STUDIES is an electronic journal with a

wide variety of links to electronic texts and other resources on

the Web: <a href=http://users.ox.ac.uk/~emls/emlshome.html> http://users.ox.ac.uk/~emls/emlshome.html</a>.

<li>JACK LYNCH'S PAGES: revered by webheads, he has a huge range of

links: <a href=http://www.english.upenn.edu/~jlynch/Lit> http://www.english.upenn.edu/~jlynch/Lit</a>.

<li>CARNEGIE-MELLON English server: <a href=http://english-server.hss.cmu.edu> http://english-server.hss.cmu.edu</a>.

<li>THE VOICE OF THE SHUTTLE is a general humanities server of some

standing: <a href=http://users.ox.ac.uk/~enginfo/shuttle/> http://users.ox.ac.uk/~enginfo/shuttle/</a>.

</ul>

<p>

<strong>SHAKESPEARE</strong><br>

<ul>

<li>MIT SHAKESPEARE SITE: <a href=http://the-tech.mit.edu/Shakespeare/works.html> http://the-tech.mit.edu/Shakespeare/works.html </a>. Very good: includes a searchable Collected Works and plenty more.
</ul>

<p>

<strong>SPENSER</strong><br>

<a href=http://www.mindspring.com/~jntolva/> http://www.mindspring.com/~jntolva/</a>, include some useful things on hypermedia and the Renaissance

<li>SPENSER HOME PAGE: <a href=http://darkwing.uoregon.edu/~rbear/> http://darkwing.uoregon.edu/~rbear/</a>has lots

of texts (of Spenser, Sidney, and others), and info, as well as

links e.g. to the SPENSER-L mailing list. Highly recommended.

<h2 align=center>ELECTRONIC MAILING LISTS</h2>

<p>

The alphabetical list which follows has been compiled from

various sources: lists which pertain to other areas of literary

research can generally be found on Jack Lynch's pages or at Early

Modern Literary Studies (addresses above). All these lists work

via e-mail and require only simple e-mail instructions to get

started. You can passively observe discussions, or become a

frequent contributor.

<p>

A couple of caveats: first, joining a list means you will receive

more e-mail and dealing with it (even if all you do is delete

large chunks) will take time. Second, it is fair to say that the

quality of academic content is not always first-rate: it is still

generally the case that if a scholar is doing important work in a

given area, then an electronic mailing-list is not the obvious

place to air it. However, plenty of excellent discussions do take

place, and if there is a problem with quality, the question is:

do you want to be part of the problem, or part of the solution?
