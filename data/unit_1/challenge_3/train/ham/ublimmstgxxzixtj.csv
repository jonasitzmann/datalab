<P>
<b>MORSE</b> is run in the same way as any other program under
unix/linux.
Assuming an executable called <b>morse</b> and has been 
<a href=compile.html>compiled</a> in relative
directory <b>../source/</b>, to run <B>MORSE</b> type
<blockquote><DIV CLASS=TERMBOX><PRE><B>   ../source/morse</b></PRE></BOX></blockquote>
Note that on some systems, if <b>morse</b> is in the local directory,
you may need to type <b>./morse</b>
rather than simply <b>morse</b>.
<P>
When run, <B>MORSE</b> attempts to open a file called <b>morse.drv</b> 
(the <a href=driver.html>driver table</a>) in the local directory which
determines which other files are required and 
controls subsequent operations. No terminal inputs are required.
<P>
A typical terminal output for a successful run would then be something like

<P>
The messages <b>R-MORSE:...</b> are always the first and (if successful)
last messages,
the first message also confirming the <a href=updates.html>version</a> 
of the software
<P>
The messages <B>I-MORSE: Processing ...</b> indicate each microwindow,
its wavenumber and tangent altitude range as read from the 
<a href=inputs.html#mwl><b>.lst</b> file</a>
in the <a href=driver.html#mwl><B>*MWL</b></a> section of the driver table.
<P>
The messages <B>I-MORSE: Processing Sweep...</b> indicate each sweep#
within the L1C data being processed for the current microwindow, 
and its (revised) tangent altitude.
<P>
An <i>unsuccessful</I> run will terminate with an
<a href=errors.html>error message</a> (usually the second line printed
to the terminal) starting with <B>F-ABCDEF</B> where
<b>ABCDEF</b> is the subroutine where the error was detected.
