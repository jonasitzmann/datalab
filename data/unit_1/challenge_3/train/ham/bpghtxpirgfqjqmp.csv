<p><a name="campmany">Elies Campmany</a> PostDoc at AOPP.</br>
  He is involved in the <a

  href="http://www.atm.ox.ac.uk/project/Quantify">QUANTIFY</a> projects
within the Earth Observation Data Group.
His research consists in create an algorithm to detect ship tracks in
ATSR2 Satellite Imagery. Ship tracks are formed in the marine boundary
layer of the atmosphere as a result of ship stack emissions.

<p><a name="carboni">Elisa Carboni</a> PostDoc at AOPP.</br> My
research is focused on aerosol retrieval using remote sensing
measurements. In particular Im interested in the comparison and the
analysis of satellite and ground based data. The main purpose of my
work is to better characterize the aerosol optical properties and to
use those properties in radiative transfer computations in order to
produce aerosol maps from satellite data and reduce the uncertainties
present on the estimate of aerosol effects on Earth radiative balance.

volcanic emission, aircraft and ship pollution, and surface
erosion.</br> e-mail: <IMG SRC="emails/don.png" align="middle"></p>

<p><a name="peters">Dan Peters</a> PostDoc at AOPP.</br> Dan's research is currently
focussed on measuring the optical properties of
"solid" atmospheric aerosols, (such as volcanic ash and Saharan dust,)
using the <a href=http://www.ssd.rl.ac.uk/msf/>NERC Molecular
Spectroscopy Facility</a> at the <a
href=http://www.rl.ac.uk/>Rutherford Appleton Laboratory</a>. The main
motivation for these measurements is to aid the extension of current
retrieval algorithms to include atmospheric aerosols. This is
currently an important contribution to climate change
uncertainty. Other interests include the <a

instrument radiometric calibration and <a

<p><a name="piccolo">Chiara Piccolo</a> PostDoc at AOPP.</br> Chiara
is working on the project "Data Assimilation" for DARC (Data
Assimilation Research Centre), under the supervision of Dr. Clive
Rodgers.  <a href=http://darc.nerc.ac.uk/>DARC</a> is a Centre of
Excellence in Earth Observation. It has the following partners:
University of Reading, Oxford, Cambridge, Edinburgh and Rutherford
Appleton Laboratory.  DARC focuses on data assimilation for the
atmosphere, using model of atmospheric chemistry and dynamics to study
the impact of research satellite data on our understanding of the
atmosphere.  The purpose of my work is to develop techniques for
making the best use of infrared limb sounders such as ISAMS (Improved
Stratospheric and Mesospheric Sounder), MIPAS (Michelson
Interferometer for Passive Atmospheric Sounding) and HiRDLS (High
Resolution Dynamics Limb Sounding).  </br> e-mail: <IMG
