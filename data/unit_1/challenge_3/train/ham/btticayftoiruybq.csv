<h2 align=center>ENGLISH RENAISSANCE BUILDINGS</h2>

<p>

CERES enters the world of virtual tourism!

<p>

One of the results of the Internet's world-shrinking capacity is the

greater availability of information about, and pictures of, beautiful

and interesting places. It happens that some of England's palaces and

country houses are very well-served by web pages. So CERES decided it

would be a good idea to undertake a characteristically obsessive

search.

<p>

The pages below offer one or more of the following: 

<ol type=i>

<li>pictures - the idea being, that the Internet offers an effective way of

accompanying reading with a visual image 

<li>historical and architectural information - often this is at a low level, but

sometimes the barest facts can be very useful

<li>banal details like when the buildings are open, how much entry costs, etc. - CERES is not wholly against real life and actually visiting places.

</ol>

<p>

The priority in what follows is not so much to cover every country

house or palace, but rather to find Internet materials relating to

them. If you have suggestions (either for websites not included, or

names which could be searched), then do get in touch. Typing a name

into an Altavista seach will often take you to the right place,

although you could always find yourself on a photo-tour of a Bed and

Breakfast.

<p>

One thing CERES should not mention is a site which invites you to

enter your name and find out if you could be related to stately

home-owners. They'll sell you a picture of 'your' house if you don't

keep your wits about you: <a href=http://www.infokey.com/hon/caslist.htm> http://www.infokey.com/hon/caslist.htm</a>.  Actually there may in some bizarre way be an academic use for this, but...

<h3 align=center>GENERAL ARCHITECTURAL</h3>

<p>

<strong>AN UNSPEAKABLY EXCELLENT SITE</strong><br>

Professor Hugh Lester of Tulane University, CERES salutes you!  His site 'Period and Style for Designers' is at <a href=http://www.tulane.edu/lester/text/lester.html> http://www.tulane.edu/lester/text/lester.html</a>.  It is a gem: carefully chosen, concisely described, clearly presented pictures of a remarkable diversity of materials. The 'English Renaissance' and 'English Baroque' areas are most directly within the

remit of CERES, but all the sections are good. Check out building

exteriors and interiors, and furniture and objects as well, from the

Pyramids to Frank Lloyd Wright.

<p>

<strong>SCAFFOLD - WWW ARCHITECTURAL SITE</strong><br>

Currently under construction (appropriately enough), with only some

images and text in place: so far Indian architecture, Vitruvius, and

Renaissance Italians are represented, plus some general architectural

materials. Head for<a href=http://ccat.sas.upenn.edu/george/scaffold.html> http://ccat.sas.upenn.edu/george/scaffold.html</a>.

<p>

<strong>RUBENS PROJECT</strong><br>

If you are interested in viewing and downloading architectural and

artistic images on a large scale then this Australian project run

from ANU will be of interest. Using secure servers, registration, and

(to access its full glory) payment, it is a pretty major undertaking.

Head for <a href=http://rubens.anu.edu.au/>http://rubens.anu.edu.au/</a> and find out more. CERES found

that Netscape and Internet Explorer were not entirely happy with the

secure server set-up and did not load some pages. From the outside it

looked like perseverance would be worthwhile.

<p>

<strong>VOICE OF THE SHUTTLE ARCHITECTURE PAGE</strong><br>

Links galore at <a href=http://humanitas.ucsb.edu/shuttle/archit.html> http://humanitas.ucsb.edu/shuttle/archit.html</a>.

<p>

<strong>WELCOME TO BRITAIN!</strong><br>

A tourism site which will give useful information as well as cool

maps showing where all the 'heritage attractions' (what a lovely

phrase!) are: <a href=http://www.britain.co.uk/> http://www.britain.co.uk/</a>.

<p>

<strong>AND FINALLY</strong><br>

A gentleman from Finland by the name of Risto Hurmalainen has created

a list of, with links to, his 100 favourite old British buildings.

Many a treasure hides therein: <a href=http://www.dlc.fi/~hurmari/castles.html> http://www.dlc.fi/~hurmari/castles.html</a>.

<h3 align=center>PLACES</h3>

<p>

<strong>HURRAH!</strong><br>

Naturally some of the best buildings and artworks are owned by our

dear Royal family. Although Earl Spencer tells us they are

old-fashioned, in fact they have a far better website than he does,

with plenty of palace(s) information at <a href=http://www.royal.gov.uk/> http://www.royal.gov.uk/</a>.

<p>

<strong>BURGHLEY HOUSE, LINCS</strong><br>

Thanks in part to Stamford's claim to be the 'finest Stone Town on

the Internet' Burghley House has a healthy web presence. Lose no time

in zapping to <a href=http://www.stamford.co.uk/burghley/index.html> http://www.stamford.co.uk/burghley/index.html</a>.  

There is some historical information but not surprisingly the main

pleasure of this site are the pictures of house, grounds, furniture,

of the excellent art collection, and of the extraordinary Heaven Room

and Hell Staircase painted by Antonio Verrio. Actually the

reproduction of the latter is disappointing.

<p>

You can reach a slightly better Hell Staircase via the Burghley House page at <a href=http://www.demon.co.uk/citygate/> http://www.demon.co.uk/citygate/</a>.

There's a little more detail about the building of Burghley here.

<p>

But it gets better! The Italian paintings from Burghley went on tour

in 1996 and the result is a superb virtual art gallery with nice

reproductions and interpretive notes under the auspices of the the

Lakeview Museum in Peoria, Illinois. Don't miss

<a href=http://www.giovanetto.com/burghley/burghley.html> http://www.giovanetto.com/burghley/burghley.html</a>.  Click on the picture-title for a bigger picture.

<p>

<strong>CASTLE HOWARD, YORKS</strong><br>

Vanbrugh-tastic! And it has its own website which is informative and

idiosyncratic: <a href=http://www.castlehoward.co.uk/> http://www.castlehoward.co.uk/</a>. The photos are arty and moody rather than actually worth looking at.  Ho hum. There are, though, some nice reproductions of architectural drawings.

<p>

The Castle Howard website people complain that the only portraits of

Vanbrugh (and those of the Kit-Cat club) are in the National Portrait

Gallery which has a policy not to allow Internet reproductions. Boo!

Although Hurrah! for the NPG's own website which is useful as a guide

to what's on show, with a few pictures: <a href=http://www.npg.org.uk/> http://www.npg.org.uk/</a>.

<p>

<strong>BLENHEIM PALACE, OXON</strong><br>

Still on the Vanbrugh trail, but sadly less to ogle electronically.

There's a small amount of information about the palace and Vanbrugh

himself at <a href=http://ernie.bgsu.edu/~smorgan/publick/blenheim.html> http://ernie.bgsu.edu/~smorgan/publick/blenheim.html</a>.  

A rare CERES mention of someone's holiday snaps - but there are

several pictures at <a href=http://www.english.upenn.edu/~rstack/album.html> http://www.english.upenn.edu/~rstack/album.html</a>.

<p>

<strong>HARDWICK HALL, DERBYS</strong><br>

Just visiting info:  <a href=http://www.openworld.co.uk/britain/pages/H/HAR45QJa.html> http://www.openworld.co.uk/britain/pages/H/HAR45QJa.html</a>.  

And there's a tiny picture and some information (also about architect

Robert Smythson) at <a href=http://dspace.dial.pipex.com/town/parade/taf24/hardwick.htm> http://dspace.dial.pipex.com/town/parade/taf24/hardwick.htm</a>.

<p>

<strong>CHATSWORTH, DERBYS</strong><br>

Derbyshire tourist info gives the basics about Chatsworth, and also

HADDON HALL, EYAM HALL, MELBOURNE HALL, etc. Find it at

<a href=http://www.derbycity.com/derby2/stately.html> http://www.derbycity.com/derby2/stately.html</a>.

<p>

<strong>WOLLATON PARK, NOTTS</strong><br>

Some historical information and pictures of this house at

<a href=http://www.innotts.co.uk/~asperges/woll.html> http://www.innotts.co.uk/~asperges/woll.html</a>.  

These pages have a style of design which is, let's say, not to

everyone's taste. If it is (!) you can link to many others under the

proprietor Jeremy Boot's auspices, many of which concern the

activities of radio hams.

<p>

<strong>AUDLEY END, ESSEX</strong><br>

Not a great deal to shout about except the bare essentials at

<a href=http://www.locata.co.uk/info/audhse.htm> http://www.locata.co.uk/info/audhse.htm</a>.

<p>

<strong>HATFIELD HOUSE, HERTS</strong><br>

The barest essentials are at <a href=http://www.kidsnet.co.uk/places/hatfield.html> http://www.kidsnet.co.uk/places/hatfield.html</a>.  Better is <a href=http://www.britain.co.uk/pages/H/HAT95NQbA.html> http://www.britain.co.uk/pages/H/HAT95NQbA.html</a> which has

several pictures: don't forget to click on the left picture for

larger version, and on the right-hand ones to swap them round. It'll

make sense when you get there.

<p>

CERES did find one other picture, but it was a holiday snap linked to

a 1995 holiday diary from a 16-year-old girl. Good taste intervened.

<p>

<strong>WILTON HOUSE, DORSET</strong><br>

Again, nothing, except details so bare they make previous use of term

'barest' seem unwise: morsels on Dorset's great houses (also

ATHELHAMPTON HOUSE, BREAMORE HOUSE, etc.) at

<a href=http://www.lds.co.uk/dt/houses.html> http://www.lds.co.uk/dt/houses.html</a>.  There's a tiny picture of ATHELHAMPTON at <a href=http://www.shogun.demon.co.uk/dorset/athelham.htm> http://www.shogun.demon.co.uk/dorset/athelham.htm</a>.

<p>

<strong>HAMPTON COURT PALACE</strong><br>

The charming people at The Discerning Eye Internet Services have

produced a virtual tour, with pictures, music, and historical

information. Check it out if you will at

<a href=http://www.the-eye.com/hcintro.htm>http://www.the-eye.com/hcintro.htm

</a>.

<p>

There's information and a bit of illustration at

<a href=http://www.realtennis.gbrit.com/> http://www.realtennis.gbrit.com/ </a> which, as its URL suggests, is most interested in the royal tennis courts. This site also has material on the history of tennis.

<p>

Grose Educational Media has thoughtfully but rather curiously decided

to reproduce a 1919 article by Ernest Law which discusses

Shakespearean performances at Hampton Court, which is the only

surviving building in which Shakespeare's plays were performed. Head

for <a href=http://www.entrenet.com/~groedmed/hampton.html> http://www.entrenet.com/~groedmed/hampton.html</a>.

<p>

<strong>LONGLEAT HOUSE, WILTS</strong><br>

Basic info and two pictures (one of the house, one of giraffes) at

<a href=http://www.wctb.co.uk/longleat.htm> http://www.wctb.co.uk/longleat.htm</a>.

<p>

No internet search would be truly complete without one consiracy

theory. Sure enough (and not suprisingly since nearby Warminster is

said to be Britain's UFO capital) Longleat is said to have been built

on a UFO crash-site. Find out not much more at

<a href=http://www.webentity.co.uk/sci-fi/news/19961020-ukufo.html> http://www.webentity.co.uk/sci-fi/news/19961020-ukufo.html</a>.

<p>

<strong>BOLSOVER CASTLE, DERBYS</strong><br>

Tourist info at <a href=http://www.locata.co.uk/info/bolscas.htm> http://www.locata.co.uk/info/bolscas.htm </a> but the

interesting thing about Bolsover is the geophysical survey undertaken

by English Heritage in order to establish the layout of an earlier

formal garden. This is pretty interesting and there are various

pictures of the castle as well as 3-D underground image things. Go to

<a href=http://www.eng-h.gov.uk/reports/bolsover/> http://www.eng-h.gov.uk/reports/bolsover/</a>.  Link from here to English Heritage and to other geophysical surveys available in HTML format (most of which look rather further back in time).

<p>

<strong>WINDSOR CASTLE, BERKS</strong><br>

You can get some sense of the variety of interiors and exteriors

through the pictures (and few words) at <a href=http://www.johansen.com/hotelnet/windsor/home.htm> http://www.johansen.com/hotelnet/windsor/home.htm</a>.  The best thing here is the 1607 bird's eye view by John Norden.

<p>

<strong>GREENWICH HOSPITAL, LONDON</strong><br>

Christopher Wren's gargantuan building is now the Royal Naval College

which allows CERES to make its first ever recommendation of a

Ministry of Defence web page. There's good coverage in words and

pictures at <a href=http://www.mod.uk/histbldg/RNC_DOH.HTM> http://www.mod.uk/histbldg/RNC_DOH.HTM</a>.  Link from here to other historical buildings under the aegis of the MoD.

<p>

<strong>KNOLE, KENT</strong><br>

Description at <a href=http://www.britain.co.uk/pages/K/KNO50RPc.html> http://www.britain.co.uk/pages/K/KNO50RPc.html</a>.  There are pictures of the house and deer-park at <a href=http://www.sevenoaks-uk.com/town.htm#knole> http://www.sevenoaks-uk.com/town.htm#knole</a>.

<p>

<strong>KENILWORTH, WARKS</strong><br>

There is information and an eye-twisting moving panorama graphic

(addictive but dangerous) at <a href=http://www.celcat.com/kworth/castle.html> http://www.celcat.com/kworth/castle.html</a>.  Link to pictures and context - don't forget to click on the tiny pictures to obtain larger versions - at

<a href=http://www.celcat.com/kworth/castle.html> http://www.celcat.com/kworth/castle.html</a>.

<p>

Cahiers Elisabethains recently featured an article by Mary Hazard

entitled 'A Magnificent Lord': Leicester, Kenilworth, and

Transformations in the Idea of Magnificence'. Link to abstract in

French or English from the CE website

<a href=http://serinf2.univ-montp3.fr/CERRA/AbsCE31.html> http://serinf2.univ-montp3.fr/CERRA/AbsCE31.html</a>.

<p>

<strong>PENSHURST PLACE, KENT</strong><br>

There's a pretty good virtual tour with only mildly annoying music at

<a href=http://www.i-way.co.uk/~sid/pens.html> http://www.i-way.co.uk/~sid/pens.html</a>.  At this site you'll find scanty biogs of some Sidneys (Philip, but not Robert), details of the building of the house, and other

historical context. It doesn't replace books, far from it, but it

can, er, bring certain things to life. Link from here to visitors'

info at <a href=http://www.seetb.org.uk/penshurst/> http://www.seetb.org.uk/penshurst/</a>.

<p>

<strong>THE QUEEN'S HOUSE, GREENWICH</strong><br>

There's some historical information on the National Maritime Museum's

website (the Queen's House is on their patch) at

<a href=http://www.nmm.ac.uk/tm/queen.html> http://www.nmm.ac.uk/tm/queen.html</a>.  Link from here to '25 Facts about the Queen's House' and details of how you can get married there, Inigo-Jones-style.

<p>

<strong>BEAULIEU, DORSET</strong><br>

It has its own web pages but very scanty material:

<a href=http://www.itl.net/features/nmm/Beaulieu.html> http://www.itl.net/features/nmm/Beaulieu.html</a>.

<p>

<strong>INIGO JONES</strong><br>

The Globe theatre website based at Reading promises more links to

Jonesy materials, and currently offers interesting photos and

drawings of the Globe's indoor theatre, which is based on designs by

Inigo Jones, probably for the Cockpit: <a href=http://www.reading.ac.uk/globe/Data-Base/Images/Jones.html> http://www.reading.ac.uk/globe/Data-Base/Images/Jones.html</a>.

<strong>CHRISTOPHER WREN</strong><br>

There's a good collection, with pictures, of Wren's buildings in

London and information about those elsewhere at

<a href=http://www.uk-guide.com/london/wren-lon.htm> http://www.uk-guide.com/london/wren-lon.htm</a>.

<strong>SIR JOHN VANBRUGH</strong><br>

There is a small biography at

<a href=http://ernie.bgsu.edu/~smorgan/publick/vanbrugh.html> http://ernie.bgsu.edu/~smorgan/publick/vanbrugh.html</a>- a page brought

<strong>BROTHERTON COLLECTION MANUSCRIPT VERSE</strong><br>

CERES is showing its age! We remember the days when this was a creaky

telnet link! (At least we think we do.) Can it be that haven't

mentioned this seriously scholarly internet search facility, enabling

you to rummage (virtually) through the individual items of English

poetry contained in the 17th and 18th century manuscripts in the

Brotherton Collection of Leeds University Library? No full texts, but

first and last lines and lots of bibliographical information. The

website expresses the hope that in time it may extend to include

material in other collections. Let's hope so. The items in question

range from contemporary copies of poems by writers like Dryden and

Pope at one literary extreme to popular tags and epitaphs at the

other. Many of the manuscripts are miscellanies and commonplace books

which have never previously been indexed, and their contents have

consequently remained largely unknown to scholars.

Pay respects to <a href=http://www.leeds.ac.uk/library/spcoll/bcmsv/intro.html> http://www.leeds.ac.uk/library/spcoll/bcmsv/intro.html</a>.

<strong>CHRIST CHURCH PICTURE GALLERY</strong><br>

Like most Oxbridge colleges Christ Church has a website, but its

coverage of the excellent picture gallery there make it stand out:

details of exhibitions and reproductions from the Renaissance Italian

collection via <a href=http://www.chch.ox.ac.uk/> http://www.chch.ox.ac.uk/</a>.

<strong>THE GALILEO PROJECT</strong><br>

This site is dedicated to the life and work of Galileo and to the

science and scientists of his era. It offers a great deal of serious

information on a well-organised site. Amongst other things it has

fairly detailed biographies of some 600 major figures in European

Renaissance science: <a href=http://es.rice.edu/ES/humsoc/Galileo/> http://es.rice.edu/ES/humsoc/Galileo/</a>.

<strong>ELECTRONIC MARLOWE</strong><br>

CERES has already mentioned this site for its texts of Dr Faustus; it

is now on the verge of being complete, with an electronic edition of

the rest of Marlowe's works. This edition collates many earlier

editions of the plays: for instance, users may select the 1590 Octavo

version of Tamburlaine the Great, Part 1 or view instead Robinson's

1826 collation. By selecting from the pop-up menu above each text,

viewers may choose between approximately twenty versions of each of

Marlowe's works. It is anticipated that every text will be available

for viewing with textual variants any day now. Find it at

<a href=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/Texts/Marlowe.html> http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/Texts/Marlowe.html</a>.

<strong>VERSIFICATION</strong><br>

Already mentioned in Harvest II.i, this comprehensive site gets a

second mention because it now hosts T.V.F. Brogan's 'English

Versification: A Reference Guide', a revised and corrected electronic

edition of Brogan's monumental annotated bibliography, Versification:

1570-1980, originally published by Johns Hopkins U.P. It will be

issued in individual files that correspond to the citation prefixes

in the Table of Contents. When the entire bibliography has been

published [and most of it seems to be there already], it will be

consolidated into a single file and a search engine added to

facilitate searches. This should be completed by early next year.

Later supplements, scheduled for 1998, will carry the bibliography's

terminus ad quem to 1987.

<strong>THE ELIOT-PHELIPS COLLECTION CATALOGUING PROJECT</strong><br>

The University of London Library has just completed the first phase

(funded by HEFCE) of a project to catalogue and conserve the

Eliot-Phelips Collection of publications printed in or relating to

Spain. The collection consists primarily of approximately 3500 books,

pamphlets, and official documents, supplemented by smaller numbers of

maps, manuscripts, and prints. Over 50% of the printed material is

from the hand-press period. Of the 971 items catalogued up to July

1997, 139 were printed before 1600, 195 between 1600 and 1699, and

213 between 1700 and 1830.

<p>

A fuller account of the project, together with a more detailed

description of the material in the collection, is now available on

the Web. It can be seen via the University of London Library home

page (URL: <a href=http://www.ull.ac.uk/ull/>http://www.ull.ac.uk/ull/</a>) or directly at URL: <a href=http://www.ull.ac.uk/ull/EP/EPIntro.html>http://www.ull.ac.uk/ull/EP/EPIntro.html</a>.

<strong>MR WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE AND THE INTERNET</strong><br>

This site has been around for a while but after its recent revision

it is a capacious and useful starting point not only for Shakespeare

resources but for Renaissance literature more generally. And, it has

moved to a new address <a href=http://daphne.palomar.edu/shakespeare/> http://daphne.palomar.edu/shakespeare/</a>.

<strong>COMPUTERS AND TEXTS ON-LINE</strong><br>

Volume 15 is now on-line! Of particular interest is Jean Chothia's

review of the Arden Shakespeare CD-ROM, with a response co-written by

Jonathan Bate. The central contention in the Computers and Texts review

is its use of the Arden 2 editions rather than the new Arden 3. URL

for C and T 15 is <a href=http://info.ox.ac.uk/ctitext/publish/comtxt/ct15/index.html> http://info.ox.ac.uk/ctitext/publish/comtxt/ct15/index.html</a>.

<strong>GIOSEFFO ZARLINO'S MUSIC TREATISES</strong><br>

The Department of Computer and Humanities (Utrecht University)

announces the publication of Gioseffo Zarlino's Music Treatises,

facsimile and transcription edited by Frans Wiering, Thesaurus

Musicarum Italicarum, Volume 1, CD-ROM for Windows 95.

<p>

Gioseffo Zarlino (1517-1590) was one of the most influential music

theorists of the Renaissance. His principal work, <cite>Le istitutioni

harmoniche</cite>, is a unique synthesis of the music theory of Antiquity,

the Middle Ages and the Renaissance, and the compositional practice

of his own time. The <cite>Dimostrationi harmoniche</cite> presents music theory

according to the axiomatic model of Euclid's <cite>Elements</cite>. In the

<cite>Sopplimenti</cite>, Zarlino displays his wide reading of classical sources

in a sharp response to Vincenzo Galilei's critique of his earlier

writings.

<p>

This CD-ROM contains the first edition of the <cite>Istitutioni</cite> (1558),

and all three treatises as they appear in the <cite>Tutte le Opere</cite> of

1588-89. Each document is available in two forms: a facsimile and a

transcription. The texts are transcribed using Standard Generalized

Markup Language (SGML), following the guidelines of the Text Encoding

Initiative (TEI). All illustrations are included, and the music

examples from both editions of the <cite>Istitutioni</cite> have been

transcribed into modern notation. Longer examples from the 1558

edition can also be played from MIDI.

<p>

The CD-ROM also contains an SGML viewer for Windows 95, a viewer for

the facsimiles, and two fonts. Together these provide a powerful and

user-friendly software environment for the TMI.

<p>

The price of the CD-ROM is 10 Dollars, 6 British Pounds [BARGAIN],

LIT. 20,000, DM 20 or DFL 20 (cost of software, CD production and

mailing). To order, please send this amount IN CASH to the address

below. If you prefer to pay by cheque, please DOUBLE the specified

sums in order to cover the banking charges we shall unavoidably

incur.
