<h3><a href="../../Courses/CDetails.cfm?CID=231&Key=002">Charmain Miller BSc(Hons) Nursing 


Tayside Institute for Health Studies </a><br />
<br />
</h3>
<p><img src="Images/charmainresized.JPG" alt="Current student Charmain Miller with her children" width="250" height="182" hspace="4" border="1" align="left" />Hi my name is Charmain and I'm studying Nursing at Abertay. I've  stayed in Fife all my life but I was born in Dundee. I left school with only my standard grades and no desire to further my education. So at sixteen I settled with my partner and we had three children together. <br />
  </p>
<p>After my second son was born I realised that I would have to start some kind of education in order to provide for my expanding family. I knew that I didn&rsquo;t want to end up in a dead end job. I started studying biology and health from home while I cared for my children.<br />
    <br />
    As the years went on it became apparent that my two oldest boys were not developing the same as others their age. Many professionals became involved with them and as time trundled along we were no further to finding out what was going on and  still don&rsquo;t to a degree. They struggled at home, school and socially and at times still don&rsquo;t get the full support  they need. This obviously has a massive impact on everyone&rsquo;s life.</p>
<p>This, and my interest in biology and health is what attracted me to nursing . I&rsquo;m very glad I chose Abertay and I&rsquo;m loving every second of it. The tutors are very approachable and understanding and classes are so interesting and informative. The course I feel gives you the right balance of theory and practice. </p>
<p>Hopefully I will go into the mental health branch in second year and learn to work with and help others who face the same difficulties as my boys. Abertay gave me a new lease of life, and one that will help me  academically and personally. </p>
<h3><a href="../../Courses/CDetails.cfm?CID=193&Key=002.002">Mhairi


Thurston

 MSc/PG.Dip Counselling</a><br />
 <br />
</h3>
<p><img src="Images/Mharianddogresized.JPG" alt="Current student Mhairi Thurston and her dog Wanda" width="163" height="250" hspace="4" border="1" align="left" />I completed my undergraduate degree in Fine Art in the 1980s.&nbsp; I subsequently trained as a primary teacher and had a career in teaching until about four years ago.&nbsp; I gave up teaching when I was officially registered blind (even though I have a very small amount of sight left).</p>
<p>Last year, I completed a Postgraduate Certificate in Counselling Skills.&nbsp; I really enjoyed it, although it was a shock to the system to be writing essays again after 20 years!&nbsp; Doing the certificate course gave me the confidence to enrol in the diploma course. The diploma course can be done full-time over one year or part-time over two years.&nbsp; I decided to do the course full-time, which was not without its challenges particularly with limited vision and three young children!&nbsp; I am, however, enjoying rising to this challenge and have decided to go on to complete an MSc next year.<br />
  <br />
  I'm glad I chose to do the counselling course at Abertay. One of its best resources it is its lecturers, particularly John Macleod who has made significant contributions to the world of counselling literature. It has also been good to use the on site Tayside Centre Counselling for practical work.<br />
  <br />
  I have been supported with my disability throughout my time at Abertay and now have voice recognition software to help me complete my assignments.<br />
  I would say that Abertay is a great place to study counselling. </p>
<h3><a href="../../Courses/CDetails.cfm?CID=241&Key=002">Arek Szewczyk BSc ( Hons) in Sport Coaching &amp; Development</a><br />
  <br />
</h3>
<p><img src="Images/Arekstudentresized2.JPG" alt="Current student Arek Szewczyk enjoying the Scottish coastline" width="250" height="188" hspace="4" border="1" align="left" />Hi, my name is Arek Szewczyk and I&rsquo;m a first year student doing a BSc ( Hons) in Sport Coaching &amp; Development course at the University of Abertay Dundee.</p>
<p>I was born and grew up in Elblag, Poland where I spent a great deal of time with my family and friends. In September 2006 I started my course and moved to Dundee -straight from finishing High School! </p>
<p>The time spent at lectures helps me to work independently in the library. I've met some really friendly people and my tutors have been very helpful with my studies. Also, as an EU citizen I am eligible for SAAS funding and do not pay tuition fees!!!</p>
<p>Dundee creates lots of opportunities for students such as jobs, nightlife, clubs or pubs or just normal shopping. It's also a good place to begin seeing the &ldquo;real&rdquo; Scotland. All the castles, cliffs and mountains leave unforgettable memories, especially when you are doing this with an international group of people. </p>
<p></p>
<p>If you have an opportunity to study here, try it, you won't regret it.</p>
