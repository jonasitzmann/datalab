<H2>Dobson Room - detailed information about the video player and displays</H2>

<center><img src="h_hel328.thm.jpg"></center>

<p>The video player is permanently wired into two 27 inch television displays, and
should be ready to go. It plays both British (European, PAL) standard and US
standard (NTSC) video tapes. Sound is played from the speakers on both
televisions.


<p><h3>OPERATION:</h3>

<p>When properly connected you should be able to power up the video player and TVs,
insert a tape and find that it starts playing and switches automatically to the
AVG1 SCART input. If not try the Abbey National test tape that should be
nearby; it should be in colour and have sound, but it does not fill the screen
vertically, and is not of especially good quality. The player automatically
senses whether the recording standard is European or US. 

<p><h3>REMOTE CONTROLS:</h3>

<p>The black Sony control operates both televisions, which should be identical.
The silver remote control operates the video player; it can either be pointed
at the player in the normal way, or at a repeater placed on top of the adjacent
television. The repeater's instructions say that it goes into standby mode after
40 minutes and can be woken up by shining the remote control at it from close
range. It operates two bright red LEDS fixed over the players front panel
sensor.


<p><h3>SOUND VOLUME:</h3>

<p>This is controlled by the infrared remote controls or from the television
front panels.


<p><h3>CABLING:</h3>

<p>This should be already set up, but you should check it the system does not work:

<p>A short SCART 'splitter' lead should be plugged into the upper SCART socket on
the video player (marked EURO AV1 IN/OUT). 

<p>This lead goes to a double socket; the two televisions are plugged separately
into these two sockets via SCART cables with plugs on each end. 

<p>There are two SCART sockets on the back of each TV; the cables must plug into
the right hand socket when viewed from the back (they should be marked with
Tippex dots). Use of the wrong socket gives a noisy picture. 

<p>Connecting one TV to the other in daisy-chain does not work - you have to use
the splitter arrangement described above. However you do not have to plug in
both TVs; no loss of quality seems to occur if the long lead is plugged into
the splitter but not into a TV. 

<p>SCART cables are exceedingly flimsy, so be suspicious if they seem damaged or
distorted. The shiny metal sheaths are inclined to come off and the pins
sometimes push out, shorting together in the process. 


<p><h3>VIDEO PLAYER SWITCHES: </h3>

<p>The COMP/S-VIDEO switch on the back of the video should be in the comp position
(in the S-out position you will get black and white). With current wooden stand,
the rear of the player is visible through a gap.

<p>The video front panel switches do not seem to matter - they relate to recording.


<p><h3>TELEVISION FRONT PANEL: </h3>

<p>The big round button is power on/off. Under the flap are 6 little buttons.  
The two central buttons control volume. The bottom left controls the input
mode. If the automatic switch-over to SCART in does not occur, you could put it
into the right mode by repeatedly pushing this button until in AV2 mode. If all
else fails, you could try feeding in the video signal via the SCART lead that
has several coloured leads at the end. The yellow lead (marked video in) that
has a grey lead soldered onto it, should be plugged into the yellow phono
socket on the TV front panel; you will have to manually set the mode with the
bottom left button. In desparation you can plug this phono output into the 13
inch monitor that is normally kept in the room. Note that the two televisions
should be identical since they are of the same type and were purchased
together. John Barnett has the manual.


<p><h3>RECORDING:</h3>

<p>The system is not set up for recording of the television, since there is no
antenna. Recording from a video camera works, going into the top SCART socket,
and selecting channel L1. We have no manual.
