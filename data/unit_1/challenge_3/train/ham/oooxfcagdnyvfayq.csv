<br>
<H4>Aims of the Scheme</H4>
<p align=justify>
The scheme is designed to provide individual members of the Society in higher education institutions with a grant not exceeding &pound;1000 in support of geographical research. &nbsp; Typical grants can be in the region of &pound;250 - &pound;500. &nbsp; This award is given specifically to help with the cost of data collection and fieldwork. &nbsp; Applications are particularly welcomed from postgraduates and those early in their research careers.
</p>
<BR>
<H4>Eligibility</H4>
<p align=justify>
Research grants are available to individuals only, and applicants must be members of the Royal Scottish Geographical Society. &nbsp; No more than one application can be accepted from an individual per year, and re-applications for the same project are not acceptable. &nbsp; Awards cannot be made retrospectively, and applications must be submitted in time for them to be considered by the Society's Research Committee. &nbsp; The closing date for applications is 31st January each year.
</p>
<BR>
<H4>Application Procedure</H4>
<p align=justify>
The linked application form (in <a href="ReseForm.htm">HTML</a> or <a href="ReseForm.doc">MS Word document</a> format) may be printed or used as a template. &nbsp; Alternatively, a printed copy may be obtained from the Society's Administrative Officer at the address below. &nbsp; Please print on only one side of the paper. &nbsp; On completion the form should be submitted with supporting documents. &nbsp; Word processed and electronically submitted forms are acceptable, but must follow the prescribed page layout.
</p>
<BR>
<H4>References</H4>
<p align=justify>
Forms for reports from two referees are provided with the application form, and applicants are responsible for sending the form to each of the referees, together with a copy of the application, and ensuring that the referees' reports have been sent to the Society in advance of the closing date. &nbsp; Applications will not normally be considered unless both references have been received by the closing date. &nbsp; The two referees should be familiar with the applicant's work, one being from outside the applicant's institution. &nbsp; The panel may contact others as necessary.
</p>
<BR>
<H4>Awarding Procedures</H4>
<p align=justify>
The Research Committee will review applications and approve the grant to be awarded at its meeting in February. &nbsp; No interviews will be held. &nbsp; All applicants will be notified in writing within one month of the Research Committee meeting, and details of the awards will be published in the Society's <i>GeogScot</i> Newsletter. &nbsp; It is regretted that no correspondence will be entered into except under exceptional circumstances. &nbsp; The grant will be paid, subject to the applicant accepting the offer, when expenditure is about to be incurred. &nbsp; Any grant not taken up within one year will be cancelled.
</p>
<BR>
<H4>Conditions of the Award</H4>
<p align=justify>
The award-holder is requested to submit a report within one year of being offered a research grant. &nbsp; This report, extending to no more than two sides of an A4 sheet, should include a full statement of how the money was spent, details of any other funds obtained, and a list of publications or conference papers resulting from the award. &nbsp; The Society's support should be acknowledged in any publication, and a copy of all the publications sent to the Society. &nbsp; Money not spent as outlined in the application must be refunded.
