<a name="intro"><h3>Introduction</h3></a>

<P>The Department develops and builds space instruments to study the
atmospheres of the Earth and the planets of the Solar System. Data
analysis for experiments already in space involves sophisticated
radiative transfer and information retrieval theory, and applications
aimed at an improved understanding of global dynamics, composition and
energy balance and their evolution. Theoretical and modelling groups
in the areas of atmospheric dynamics, physical oceanography, nonlinear
processes and geophysical and planetary fluid dynamics study
fundamental atmospheric processes, and carry out laboratory
experiments on rotating fluids. The overall goals are to understand
how atmospheres function, as physical systems; to understand their
origin and evolution; and to seek physics-based solutions to problems
of the global environment such as ozone depletion, greenhouse warming,
and climate change.</P>

<a name="earth"><h3>Earth Observation</h3></a>

<P>The flow of publications from the Improved Stratospheric and Mesospheric Sounder experiment on the Upper Atmosphere Research Satellite continues. We now have a total of 92 publications in the list, including 10 theses, 57 in refereed journals, and 16 in refereed conference proceedings (e.g. Advances in Space Research and NATO ASI's). John Remedios has been leading the UARS Science Team project to produce a UARS constituent reference atmosphere. Katerina Koutoulaki has completed her thesis on non-LTE in ISAMS ozone measurements. </P>
<P>Historical data from Nimbus 4,5,6 and 7 have been transferred to CD-ROM, and index &amp; documentation is available on the web. ISAMS data is already available in this form. </P>
<P>We have become more involved in the data analysis side of the Michelson Interferometer for Passive Atmospheric Sounding (MIPAS) project. Anu Dudhia has become a member of the MIPAS Scientific Advisory Group. Amongst the work carried out here is the provision of a reference forward model with which the operational model can be validated, and the development of methods whereby the operational retrieval have been speeded up by an order of magnitude. Victoria Bennett is developing an objective technique to select microwindows for retrieval. Clive Rodgers has become closely involved in retrieval work for the Tropospheric Emission Spectrometer (TES), and is assisting with the theoretical basis of the retrieval algorithms.</P>
<P>John Remedios is leading an EC Framework 4 study (Â‘POSTCODE') of Polar Stratospheric Clouds and Ozone Depletion, involving seven European partners. The work includes the use of in-situ and satellite data, laboratory measurements and chemical and microphysical modelling. </P>
<P>We are a part of a consortium led by Brian Kerridge at RAL to carry out a study for ESA on the proposed Atmospheric Chemistry Explorer satellite (ACE). Our part of the work is primarily the assessment of the capabilities of mid-IR sounding methods. </P>
<P>A D Phil student (Pauline Sinclair) has started a project to measure urban pollution using a simple Fourier transform infrared spectrometer. The equipment is now set up and working on short optical paths in the science area. </P>
<P>Paul Morris has been working with the RAL ATSR team by using the MIPAS RFM to calculate improved transmittance tables for their retrievals. A student project (Sarah Watts) to use the ATSR data to study tropical cirrus has begun. </P>
<P>Paul Palmer has almost completed his work on the use of optimal estimation methods for the retrieval of temperature and water from Global Positioning System (GPS) data. </P>

<a name="hirdls"><h3>High Resolution Dynamics Limb Sounder (HIRDLS)</h3></a>

<P>The Department is collaborating with other groups in the UK and USA to build the HIRDLS remote sounding satellite instrument to fly on the Chem-1 satellite in 2002. Chem-1 is part of NASA's Earth Observing System suite of satellites, and HIRDLS will measure the concentration of trace species, temperature and pressure variations in the Earth's atmosphere between about 8 and 100 km altitude. The primary aim of HIRDLS is to measure at a much finer spatial scale than previous instruments, to about 1 km vertical resolution and 500 km horizontally. Oxford is taking the scientific and technical lead in the UK, with the Rutherford Appleton Laboratory, Reading University, Matra Marconi Space and GEC-Marconi playing major roles. The University of Colorado at Boulder is taking the lead in the USA, with the National Center for Atmospheric Research, the University of Washington and lead by Lockheed-Martin companies undertaking major activities. The NERC is providing the British funding, and NASA the US funding.</P>
<P>Oxford is also building part of the hardware, namely the in-flight radiometric calibration target and electronics, the instrument gyroscope electronics, and the electrical and thermal ground support equipment. Oxford will also be calibrating the instrument before launch, and to this end is currently building a calibration laboratory plus test equipment. In addition the Department is undertaking a number of software tasks concerned with flight operations and data processing, and will be using the data for scientific research. </P>
<P>The design is now nearly final in most areas after several years of iteration, in conjunction with our collaborators, and detailed and extensive modelling of individual items. A prototype of the in-flight calibration target has been built during the last year, and work has started in constructing the gyro electronics. The electrical ground support equipment for the Engineering Model has been delivered. Building of the calibration facility began in spring 1997. The complex floor structure has been completed, and clean room installation is about half completed. Since the instrument has unusually stringent pointing requirements (better than an arc second), a very stable calibration environment is necessary. To achieve this, a 10 ton steel and high strength concrete seismic mass has been manufactured. This is mounted within the floor on pneumatic mounts to isolate the instrument and test equipment from vibrational disturbances. A 5 m long 2.3 m diameter aluminium vacuum chamber has been constructed to our design, and will be installed in late 1998. It will be mounted on the floor above the seismic mass with an optical bench inside the chamber supported on the mass via columns passing through flexible diaphragms in the chamber wall. Design of the calibration equipment to be mounted in the chamber has begun, and an innovative design has been developed for the large radiometric targets that are also required. A major effort has been put into the calibration of temperature sensors, since they govern our knowledge of radiometric emission from both the on-board and the ground calibration targets, and hence directly affect the instrument measurement accuracy. The requirement is to measure to 70 mK absolute, during the 5 years in orbit, and it currently appears that this will be achieved. This builds on work which we undertook for the calibration of the ATSR instruments where greater accuracies were obtained.</P>



<a name="ad"><P><h3>Atmospheric Dynamics</h3></a>

<P>We use a variety of numerical dynamical models to interpret satellite and other data on the mesosphere, stratosphere and troposphere. </P>
<P>We are using a global circulation model to test the effects of different gravity-wave drag parameterisations on the simulated middle atmosphere, as part of an EC-funded project (IGWOC). A similar model is being used to simulate nonlinear atmospheric tides in the middle atmosphere. We have also used a simpler 'mechanistic' model to explore the dynamics of the equatorial quasi-biennial oscillation in the stratosphere. Linear and nonlinear instability studies are being carried out with a view to modelling some observed travelling planetary waves in the summer mesosphere. We are co-ordinating an EC-funded project (TOPOZ II), to validate and improve chemical transport models of the tropical and midlatitude lower stratosphere: accurate modelling of these regions is vital for predictions of future ozone change from increased aircraft emissions and other anthropogenic changes. We have started a project on coupled modes of interaction between the stratosphere and the troposphere to examine how changes in stratospheric circulation, e.g. from ozone depletion, affect these modes and so could affect the surface climate. </P>
<P>We are looking at air-sea interactions in the North Atlantic, in collaboration with researchers from Reading University. Using a global circulation model, we find that changes in the sea surface temperatures in the subtropics affect the moisture supply into a convective region over South America, which then affects the large-scale circulation in the extratropics. In separate work, the atmospheric response to varying sea surface temperature boundary conditions (specifically, the forced atmospheric response to El Ni&ntilde;o - Southern Oscillation) has been studied by diagnosing multidecadal general circulation model runs from the Hadley Centre, using a probabilistic approach that has been successfully applied to theoretical case studies. The technique helps distinguish a genuine forced response from internal (noise) modes. </P>



<a name="gpfd"><h3>Geophysical and Planetary Fluid Dynamics</h3></a>

<P>Studies of fundamental dynamical processes in rotating fluids have continued on several fronts, including the dynamics of nonlinear baroclinic and barotropic instabilities, and interactions between baroclinic waves and other factors such as bottom topography and ageostrophic inertia-gravity wave modes. Further analysis of some of our earlier experiments on the generation of small-scale waves within a baroclinic life-cycle in a two-layer stratified flow have confirmed that the small-scale structures are fast inertia- gravity waves. These waves are probably generated as a result of adjustment processes during the evolution of the geostrophically balanced baroclinic wave field, and their discovery may have some important theoretical and practical implications for dynamical meteorology and weather prediction. Some new experiments on a detached shear layer in a rotating, homogeneous fluid, using particle-tracking methods for flow visualisation and measurement, have revealed more clearly the nature of some nonlinear wave interactions in barotropic instability discovered in some earlier experiments, and have also revealed a new transition at values of Rossby number ~ 1 at which the flow undergoes a rapid change from a set of geostrophically-balanced barotropic vortices to a highly ageostrophic, axisymmetric regime dominated by toroidal Taylor-Gsrtler vortices. The development of a fully semi-Lagrangian model of baroclinic flow in a rotating annulus was completed, and a detailed comparison of simulations carried out for verification with laboratory measurements. Experiments at moderate spatial resolution continue to suggest a systematic tendency of semi-Lagrangian schemes to over-estimate heat transport, which can lead to quantitative errors e.g. in the parametric location of baroclinic regime transitions. New laboratory measurements have also been obtained, which will form a new benchmark for future evaluations of numerical techniques in Oxford and elsewhere. </P>
<P>&nbsp;Models for use in planetary atmosphere studies also continue to be a major activity with the GPFD group. Development of the Mars general circulation model has continued in collaboration with the Laboratoire de M&eacute;t&eacute;orologie Dynamique du CNRS in Paris, focussing on refining and extending the physical parameterisation schemes (e.g. for radiative transfer and dust), and on a detailed comparison of model simulations with newly acquired observations of Mars from the Mars Pathfinder and Mars Global Surveyor missions. The latter comparison has shown excellent agreement with the Pathfinder surface meteorological observations, particularly with regard to the thermal variations at the Pathfinder location and the diurnal cycle and thermal tides. A new tracer transport scheme for the Mars GCM has also been developed successfully, and will be used shortly to simulate the cycle of dust suspension and transport in the Martian atmosphere. Good progress has also been made on the development of a simple general circulation model (SGCM) of Jupiter's troposphere and stratosphere, based on a version of the UK Meteorological Office Unified Model. A number of simulations have been carried out using simplified parameterisations of radiative transfer and dissipation, demonstrating the formation of moderately realistic coherent oval vortices in jet-like flows at mid-latitudes, and the propagation of equatorial planetary waves in the equatorial zone. It is hoped to develop this model further in the future with more sophisticated and comprehensive physical parameterisations, for use in the interpretation of observations from the Galileo and Cassini missions to Jupiter and Saturn. </P>



<a name="plan"><h3>Planetary Experiments</h3></a>

<P>After its launch in 1989, and a six year interplanetary cruise, the Galileo spacecraft arrived at its final destination, Jupiter, on December 7th, 1995. After deploying a separate entry probe, the main spacecraft went into a highly elliptical orbit about the planet. Oxford is part of the international team which provided the Near Infrared Mapping Spectrometer (NIMS) on board the orbiter which measures of the infrared spectrum from 0.7 - 5.2 mm. Oxford has played a key role in the analysis of the NIMS data, which began to arrive in June 1996, using advanced radiative transfer code which is able to simulate the complex, scattering processes in that cloudy atmosphere. This model, combined with optimal estimation retrieval code also developed in Oxford, has provided new estimates of cloud heights and properties together with the abundances of gases such as water vapour and ammonia. To assist in this analysis, Oxford has conducted a program for many years to measure the spectral characteristics of Jovian gases in the laboratory and a new study has just been completed investigating the transmission of methane at the low temperatures found in the Jovian atmosphere. </P>
<P>&nbsp;The analysis of NIMS measurements of Jupiter is by no means complete and will continue to provide the core of the group's work for at least the next year. However, new projects are rapidly approaching with which we will shortly be having a major involvement. The most pressing of these involvements will be to analyse the measurements of the Martian atmosphere made by the Pressure Modulator Infrared Radiometer (PMIRR). This instrument was originally launched in 1992 on board the 'Mars Observer' spacecraft which unfortunately failed immediately prior to arrival at Mars. The rebuilt version of PMIRR, parts of which were designed and made in this sub-department, will be launched on Mars Climate Surveyor in December 1998 and will begin measurements at the end of 1999. We are planning to play a central role in the operational retrieval of temperature, pressure, water vapour and dust profiles from these measurements and are currently updating the retrieval suites developed for the first PMIRR. </P>
<P>The department also built a significant fraction of the composite infrared Spectrometer (CIRS) experiment on the Cassini mission to Saturn which was launched in October 1997. The planetary experiments group is now involved in spacecraft operations and mission planning and, when Cassini reaches Saturn in 2004, will take a lead role in using the instrument to investigate the atmospheres of Saturn and Titan. </P>
<P>In addition to the major projects outlined above, we are also involved, to a lesser extent in a number of other missions. Oxford is part of an international team (with other members at QMW, Canada) analysing the infrared spectra of Saturn and Titan measured by the Infrared Space Observatory (ISO). Simulations of the infrared spectrum of Titan, the largest of Saturn's moons and a key target of the Cassini mission, launched in October 1997, have been conducted to assist in the mission planning of that project. </P>



<a name="oceancc"><h3>Oceanography and Climate Change</h3></a>

<P>Methods of detecting the "fingerprint" of anthropogenic climate change are being developed, using a combination of statistical analysis and inverse modelling techniques to compare climate model simulations with recent decadal-timescale changes in variables such as surface and atmospheric temperatures. </P>
<P>Work has continued on understanding the physical processes that maintain global ocean circulation and the ocean's role in climate. We have been analysing hydrographic and CFC observations from the North Atlantic and Southern Oceans to </P>
<P>measure rates of water mass formation and hence the ocean's part in the global heat balance. Dense outflows, carrying high CFC signals, have been traced over thousands of kilometres revealing the equatorward path of chilled abyssal water. </P>
<P>A new programme of research focused on the role of ocean-atmosphere interactions in the climate of the North Atlantic Region has begun. Using an adjoint sensitivity method, we are investigating the ocean processes that drive decadal variability in sea surface temperature and may thus take part in low-frequency, coupled climate oscillations.</P>
