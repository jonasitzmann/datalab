<strong>EARLY MODERN ENGLISH DICTIONARIES DATABASE</strong><br>
When complete, this could turn out to be outstandingly useful. As
it stands, it is already a considerable resource. The principle
behind this project, edited by Ian Lancashire, is to collect
early dictionary materials and make them searchable. Head for the
start page at <a href=http://www.chass.utoronto.ca:8080/english/emed/emedd.html>http://www.chass.utoronto.ca:8080/english/emed/emedd.html</a>.
Here you'll find a useful introduction to EMEDD, including a
history of the project, and reflections on the nature of
renaissance word-meanings etc.
<p>
The present EMEDD includes 18 works at various stages of
completion:
<ul>
<li>six bilingual dictionaries - John Palsgrave (1530;
English-French), Sir Thomas Elyot (1538; Latin- English), William
Thomas (1550; Italian-English), Thomas Thomas (1587;
Latin-English), John Florio (1598; Italian-English), and Randle
Cotgrave (1611; French-English) - these give pairs of French,
Italian, and Latin dictionaries, each pair separated by 50-80
years.
<li>four English hard-word dictionaries - Edmund Coote (1596), Robert
Cawdrey (1604; courtesy of Raymond Siemens), John Bullokar (1616),
and Henry Cockeram (1623) - and one English word-list by Richard
Mulcaster (1582).
<li>the first full English-only dictionary - Thomas Blount (1656).
<li>three specialized lexicons - William Turner on herbal names
(1548), Henry Mainwearing on maritime words (1644), and John
Garfield on scientific terms (1657).
<li>four treatises with substantial glossing - Pierre Valence on
French grammar (1528), Richard Sherry on schemes (1550) and on
figures (1555), and George Puttenham on the English poetics
(1589).
</ul>
<p>
The 11 of these which are currently in presentable form can be
searched using 'Patterweb', a search device created by Mark Catt.
This allows intelligent and flexible searching, e.g. with
combination searches, searching through dictionaries individually
or as a group. It is possible to search for words near each other
(e.g. pawn near chess) or NOT near each other (pawn not near
chess) which is a clever idea. The search page is
<a href=http://www.chass.utoronto.ca/english/emed/patterweb.html>http://www.chass.utoronto.ca/english/emed/patterweb.html</a>. Available: Palsgrave, William Thomas, Mulcaster, Thomas Thomas, Coote, Minsheu, Cawdrey, Bullokar, Cockeram, Blount, Garfield.
<p>
EMEDD is part of the older and larger Edicta project which
incorporates similar projects relating to French and Latin. Find
out more, and use the links, at
<a href=http://www.chass.utoronto.ca:8080/~wulfric/edicta/intro.htm>http://www.chass.utoronto.ca:8080/~wulfric/edicta/intro.htm</a>.
<p>
Interestingly and conveniently a recent Special Issue of the
on-line journal EMLS features uses of the dictionary database
mainly relating to Shakespeare. Seek inspiration at
<a href=http://www.humanities.ualberta.ca/emls/si-01/si-01toc.html>http://www.humanities.ualberta.ca/emls/si-01/si-01toc.html</a>
Most of these essays grew out of Ian Lancashire's graduate course
on Shakespeare's language offered at the University of Toronto in
1995-96.
<p>
<strong>MIDDLETON ON-LINE</strong><br>
Surely one of the best electronic texts on offer. Chris Cleary
maintains this site based at the U of Virginia, and has so far
produced electronic editions of three-quarters of Middleton's
work (ranging from plays certainly written by Middleton alone to
dubious collaborations). This is an attractive set of pages and
the texts are clear and intelligently annotated; each play's
notes starts with a brief but sensible introduction. One of the
best features is that interesting points of vocabulary are not
only glossed but also linked, hypertextually, to other instances
in Middleton. Some of the notes are more extended and also make
use of links. Coming soon: the rest of the plays, and full
textual apparatus. As Cleary notes, these editions are not
refereed, but they have been undertaken carefully. Head for
<a href=http://dayhoff.med.virginia.edu/~ecc4g/middhome.html>http://dayhoff.med.virginia.edu/~ecc4g/middhome.html</a>.

<strong>RICHARD BEAR'S SNOWBALL</strong><br>
Yet more e-texts have been added to Richard Bear's Renascence
Editions website at: <a href=http://darkwing.uoregon.edu/~rbear/ren.htm>http://darkwing.uoregon.edu/~rbear/ren.htm</a>.  Thomas Campion's <cite>Observations on the Art of English Poesie</cite> has very recently appeared, along with seven John Milton online books,
now available in new HTML editions and published by arrangement
with Judy Boss of University of Nebraska at Omaha. They are:
<ul>
<li><cite><a href=http://darkwing.uoregon.edu/~rbear/areopagitica.html>Areopagitica</a></cite>
<li><cite><a href=http://darkwing.uoregon.edu/~rbear/comus.html>Comus</cite>

<strong>ELECTRONIC SIXTEENTH CENTURY JOURNAL</strong><br>
ESCJ, which has been around since last July, has been rather
underpublicised. So we are publicising it again: <a href=http://www.truman.edu/escj/home.html>http://www.truman.edu/escj/home.html</a>. Like many journal websites it has a nice logo but is a little thin
on content. One or two features do have the potential to save shoe
wear, such as the abstracts of articles from recent issues of
Sixteenth Century Journal, and the list, in full and brief formats
and with an index, of books in the Sixteenth Century Essays and
Studies series:<br>
Abstracts: <a href=http://www.truman.edu/escj/abstracts.html>http://www.truman.edu/escj/abstracts.html</a><br>
Books: <a href=http://www.truman.edu/escj/books.html>http://www.truman.edu/escj/books.html</a>.<br>

past and future.

<strong>MEDIEVAL AND RENAISSANCE GAMES</strong><br>
This meticulously-prepared page features a huge variety of games
from many periods and cultures. Rules, pictures, documents, and
discussions are all available, many of them on this site, and
others via links. It is aimed at the player rather than at the
scholar, which makes it quite a refreshing read, but it could
well be a highly useful and informative aid to those who wonder
about the rules of obscure games that crop up in their reading.

<strong>ELIZABETHAN REVIEW</strong><br>
This is an on-line journal of less standing than some and, I am
afraid to report, takes an unhealthy interest in the question of
whether the Earl of Oxford wrote Shakespeare's plays. Still, some
of its output is on-line and there may be things of interest. You
can find ER at <a href=http://www.elizreview.com/>http://www.elizreview.com/</a>.

<strong>FLORIMENE ON THE WEB</strong><br>
This project is at heart a teaching resource, using electronic
media to guide students through 17th century staging via the
example of Florimene. Started in 1988, it has (not surprisingly)
changed its method considerably and the genesis of the current
WWW format takes up some space on the site, but it is
interesting. The material on staging is impressively technical
and represented in wonderfully bilious colours which recall the
great days of 1980s computing. For content and for its
demonstration of what can be done, this is worth a visit:

<p>
<strong>TYBURN TREE</strong><br>
A website devoted to public execution in early modern England,
including texts (a couple of homilies), selections from other
contemporary documents (Kyd, Pepys, Boswell, Newgate Calendar), a
few dying speeches, images, bibliography, and links. The site is
unfinished and apologises for this; its current sponsor clearly
wants to hand it over to someone else. Nevertheless, some stuff...

<p>
<strong>MONTAIGNE STUDIES</strong><br>
The journal's homepage includes tables of contents of past issues
but not electronic versions of the articles. Included also is the
'Bibliotheca Desaniana' which includes bibliographical details
and facsimile title-pages of editions from the first to Dali's
selection from Cotton's translation. Links from here to some
French renaissance texts and resources. Head for:

<p>
<strong>RENAISSANCE FORUM NEW ISSUE</strong><br>
The Autumn 1997 (2.2) issue of <cite>Renaissance Forum</cite> is available on
the WWW from <a href=http://www.hull.ac.uk/renforum/index.html>http://www.hull.ac.uk/renforum/index.html</a>.  Contents include: Steve Longstaffe, 'What is the English history
play and why are they saying such terrible things about it?'; David
Siar, 'Jean E. Howard's Postmodern Marxist Feminism and the

view of Hamlet's First Soliloquy.  Plus reviews by Nick Cox, J. C. Davis, Lisa Hopkins, Romauld I. Lakowski, Mark E. C. Perrott, Jeffrey Powers-Beck and J. A. Sharpe
of books by or edited by Simon Barker, David Bevington, David
Cressy, Christopher Durston and Jacqueline Eales, R.A. Foakes, Sean
Kelsey, William Lamont, Diarmaid MacCulloch, Julia Reinhard Lupton,

<p>
<strong>DISEASE IN EARLY MODERN ENGLAND</strong><br>
'The Discursive Construction of Disease in Early Modern England' is
a proposed panel for the 1988 Sixteenth Century Studies Conference
in Toronto, Ontario (10/22-25) will focus on the role of texts -
medical, religious, juridico-political and literary - in the
production of discourses of disease and illness in early modern
England. Of special interest are papers that examine the political
agendas of this discourse and the notions of particular diseases
they produce.  Abstracts were due by January 30, 1998; more information can be had from John Gibbs, Texas A&M University, Department of English, College Station, TX 77843-4227 or on email at <a href=mailto:jog367a@unix.tamu.edu>jog367a@unix.tamu.edu</a>.
<p>
<strong>1998 SAN FRANCISCO MLA PANELS</strong><br>
<ol type=1>
<li>'English Prose Fiction and the Construction of Readership in the
1590s', devoted to examining the emergence of prose fiction in the
final decade of the sixteenth century. Of particular interest are
papers that discuss the historical conditions of the genre's
appearance and the concomitant emergence of its audience. Papers
may also touch on questions of authorship, especially regarding how
authors perceived themselves, their medium, and their readership,
or questions of the social function of prose - its role in the
generation and maintenance of political ideology.
Abstracts were due by January 30, 1998; more information can be had from John Gibbs, Texas A&M University, Department of English, College Station, TX
77843-4227 or on email at <a href=mailto:jog367a@unix.tamu.edu>jog367a@unix.tamu.edu</a>.
<li>'Maiden Knights: Masculinities in the Early Modern Prose Romances
in England' - call for papers on heroic and romantic masculinity,
male friendship, race, class and masculinity, the homoerotics of
prose romances, masculinity and nationalism, masculinity and
mecantilisim, women and their relationship to the masculine in
early romances, male cross-dressing - and other topics that
historicize and theorize the construction of masculinity in prose
romances in the 16th and 17th century.  Abstracts were due by March 10, 1998; more information is available from Goran Stanivukovic,
University College of Cape Breton, P.O. Box 5300, Sydney, Nova
Scotia, Canada B1P 6L2, or on email at <a href=mailto:gstanivu@uccb.ns.ca>gstanivu@uccb.ns.ca</a>.
<li>'Faces in Early Modern England'. How were faces constructed,
represented and experienced in early modern England? Papers can
address any aspect of faces in literature and culture from the
period. Abstracts were due by 1 March 1998; for more information, write to Laura
B. Wilson, Campus Box 226, University of Colorado at Boulder,
Boulder, CO  80309.
