The purpose of the HIRDLS SIPS (Science Investigator-led Processing System) is to generate HIRDLS higher-order standard data
products and associated quality assurance information from HIRDLS lower-order standard data products and from ancillary data
products from the Aura spacecraft, and to provide for the appropriate distribution, archiving and monitoring of those
generated products. A secondary, but no less important purpose of the SIPS is to allow a high degree of interactivity
between software developers, instrument scientists and the processing software, permitting a fast turnaround from algorithm
problem diagnosis to correction.
<br><br>
The SIPS is composed of a large array of processors and support systems and is located at the University
of Colorado, HIRDLS group laboratory in Boulder Colorado. Instrument data called production data sets (PDS)
are delivered from the NASA EOS Computing System (ECS) in Goddard Space Flight Center, Greenbelt,
Maryland in the USA in two hour granules only about 4 hours after being delivered from the spacecraft. These
data are processed at the SIPS by first being geo-located and calibrated to produce level 1 files, 
then geophysical products are retrieved to produce level 2 files. Level 3 files are gridded data. These
products are delivered to the Distributed Archive system (DAAC) at Goddard where they are copied to the
British Atmospheric Data Centre (BADC) at the Rutherford Laboratories in Oxfordshire.

The HIRDLS products are available to users in the United Kingdom and Europe at the
<a href="http://badc.nerc.ac.uk">British Atmospheric Data Centre </a> which is
located at the Rutherford Appleton Laboratory near Chilton in Oxfordshire.
<br><br>
All the details for searching, acquisition, extraction and manipulation of the data
are available at that web site. You will need to submit an application to access the
data as indicated when you arrive at the web site.
<br><br>
There you will find some documentation and useful information about the data.
The BADC accepts enquiries about the data from users, they may choose to forward the 
questions to the Oxford group <a href="mailto:J.Barnett1@physics.ox.ac.uk"> Principal 
Investigator </a> but you are welcome to contact us directly about the HIRDLS program, the
mission, instrument, calibration etc etc.
