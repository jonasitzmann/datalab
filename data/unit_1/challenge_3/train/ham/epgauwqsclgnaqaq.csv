Data Analysis
</H2>

<H3>
 The Earth 
</H3>
<P>
The analysis of data from Earth observation missions is primarily
focussed on determining profiles of temperature, pressure and trace gas
concentrations.  In addition we have developed techniques to determine cloud and aerosol properties from both limb and nadir viewing instruments.
<P>
The main instruments being used in scientific investigations are

<UL>
<LI><H3>Along Track Scanning Radiometer (ATSR)</H3> 
<P>
 The dual view design of ATSR makes it possible to estimate and
correct for these atmospheric effects. The two views result from the
instrument's conical scanning mechanism. Each scan takes readings from
the nadir position and then sweeps round to take measurements from a
point about 900 km along the satellite's track. A few minutes after
acquiring the forward view, the satellite passes over the same spot
and takes readings for the nadir view.  This design has, among other
things, enabled the accurate measurement of sea surface temperature to
an accuracy of  0.3K+ACE-

<LI><H3>High Resolution Dynamics Limb Sounder (HIRDLS)</H3> 
<P>
HIRDLS is an infrared limb-scanning radiometer to sound the upper
troposphere, stratosphere, and mesosphere to determine temperature+ADs-
the concentrations of minor species and aerosols+ADs- and the locations of
polar stratospheric clouds and cloud tops. The high horizontal and
vertical resolution and improved sensitivity and accuracy will lead to
an improved understanding of atmospheric processes through data
analysis, diagnostics, and models.

<LI><H3>Michelson Interferometer for Passive Atmospheric Sounding (MIPAS)</H3> 
<P>
MIPAS is one of the core experiments on ESA's Envisat satellite
launched on 1st March 2002. MIPAS measures an atmospheric limb
emission spectra from 685-2410 cm-1 (14.5 to 4.1um) every 4.5 seconds,
stepping in tangent altitude from 68-6km over 85 seconds. From these
measurements, profiles of atmospheric temperature and composition can
be retrieved. Using MIPAS's ability to observe trace gas emission
lines has resulted in the regular global monitoring of several important
trace species (e.g. SO2, SF6) for the first time.

<LI><H3>Tropospheric Emission Spectrometer (TES)</H3> 
<P>
TES is a high-resolution infrared-imaging Fourier transform
spectrometer with the capability to make both limb and nadir
observations that will further understanding of long-term variations
in the quantity, distribution, and mixing of minor gases in the
troposphere, including sources, sinks, troposphere-stratosphere
exchange, and the resulting effects on climate and the biosphere.

The Planets 
</H3>



<P> The analysis of data from planetary observation missions is focussed
on two main areas. Analysis of remotely observed spectra in the thermal
infrared wavelength range (lambda > 4 microns) may be used to determine
mainly vertical profiles of temperature and gas abundance, while 
observations of reflected sunlight may be used to infer the vertical cloud
structure and cloud scattering properties. Many of the techniques used in
this effort are very similar to those used in Earth observations with the
main difference being that much less a priori information is known about
other planetary atmospheres and thus more emphasis is placed on raw
spectral data analysis to infer bulk properties.
<P> 
The main missions with which we have an involvement are:
<UL>
<LI><H3>Near Infrared Mapping Spectrometer (NIMS)</H3>
<P>
NIMS was an instrument on the NASA 
<A HREF="http://galileo.jpl.nasa.gov/"> Galileo </A> mission to Jupiter
which was launched in 1989 and arrived at Jupiter in June 1995. Galileo
remained in orbit about Jupiter for just over nine years before finally
plunging into Jupiter's atmosphere and burning up on September 21st
2003. Galileo's fiery end ensured that no organic material from the Earth
would contaminate any of Jupiter's icy moons. 
The <A HREF="http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/galileo/instruments/nims.html"> NIMS </A>
instrument recorded spectra from 0.7 to 5.2 microns, with a resolution of
0.0125 microns below 1 micron and 0.025 microns above.

thermal emission from deeper levels escaping to space where the overlying
cloud decks are thin. </td> </tr> </table>

CIRS is one of the instruments on the NASA/ESA 
<A HREF="http://saturn.jpl.nasa.gov/index.cfm"> Cassini-Huygens </A>
mission, launched to
Saturn in October 1997. Cassini also carries the ESA Huygens entry probe
which will enter the atmosphere of Saturn's giant moon Titan shortly after
Cassini arrives at Saturn on July 4th 2004. The CIRS instrument is a
Fourier Transform Spectrometer covering the wavelength range of 10-600cm-1
with a circular IFOV of diameter 3.9 mrad and 600-1400 cm-1 with 10
detectors each with a square IFOV of 0.3x0.3 mrad. 

<p> <table> <tr> <td width=33%> <img src="Cooler-382.jpeg"> </td>
<td width=67%> Oxford supplied the radiative cooler and cold focal
plane assembly for the CIRS on Cassini. The cooler is used to cool the
middle infrared detectors to 80K, and consists of a black honeycomb
radiator supported by thin stainless steel wire which isolate it
thermally from the warmer cooler structure.  </td> </tr> </table>

The Cassini image (SSI) made spectacular new observations of Jovian clouds 
which have helped to better constrain cloud top winds. Combined with 
thermal wind maps derived from CIRS data, the winds at all altitudes above 
the cloud tops have been re-evaluated with unprecedented accuracy. <p>

<LI><H3>Pioneer Venus/VORTEX</H3>
<P>
Part of the payload of the first artificial satellite of Venus -
Pioneer Venus Orbiter in 1979 - was built at Oxford.  Data analysis from
this instrument, the Venus Orbiter Radiometric Temperature Sounding
Experiment (VORTEX), is still being analysed, in collaboration with
colleagues who made similar observations from the VENERA series of Venus
probes. Oxford scientists were also part of the team that observed Venus
with the NIMS instrument on the Galileo spacecraft in 1991.

Venus Express </A> is due for launch in November 2004 from the Baikonur
Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan. After a voyage of 153 days it will be
placed in an eccentric polar orbit about Venus. At its closest, it will
reach an altitude of 250 kilometres while at its furthest, it will be 66
000 kilometres away from the planet. The mapping mission is due to last
for 2 Venusian days, about 500 Earth days.
<p>
Venus Express will carry a number of flight-spare instruments left over
from other missions. Oxford's involvment is with the 
<A 
HREF="http://sci.esa.int/science-e/www/object/index.cfm?fobjectid=33964&fbodylongid=1447">
VIRTIS </A> instrument
(Visible and Infrared Thermal Imaging Spectrometer) originally
developed for the Rosetta mission. VIRTIS is both a mapping
instrument and a high resolution spectrometer. The mapping part of the
instrument bears much resemblance to the Cassini VIMS instrument. A
grating spectrometer casts light on two 256x256 focal plane arrays. A
silicon CCD array records the spectrum from 0.25 to 1 micron while a
HgCdTe array covers the spectral range 0.95 - 5 microns. The
instantaneous FOV of each pixel is 0.25 mrad. Hence a single observation
consists of a line of 256 pixels covering 64 mrad and recording 512
wavelengths in all. The spectral resolution of the visible mapper is ~3
nm, while that of the infrared mapper is ~30 nm.

The high resolution channel has a FOV of 0.45x2.25 mrad in 'pushbroom' and
records the IR spectrum from 2-5microns with a spectral resolution of ~3
nm.

<A HREF="http://sci.esa.int/science-e/www/area/index.cfm?fareaid=13">
Rosetta </A> is due for launch in Debruary 2004 from French Guiana to
the Comet 67-P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko. Its mission is to examine a
cometary nucleus from close quarters as the comet approaches the Sun and
then develops its tail. Understanding the composition and structure of
these remnants of solar system formation is important  for understanding
the origin and evolution of the solar system, and the composition of the
planets. After an  extended  gravitationally assisted tour, Rosetta
will begin its rendezvous manoeuvre with Comet Churyumov/Gerasimenko in
May 2011 during the comet's approach to the sun and will achieve its
final close orbit in August 2014.  At  closest approach, the orbiter
will be only 1 km  above the nucleus and active observations
are planned to  be taken for 16 months up until the  nominal end  of
mission, coinciding  with  the  perihelion passage of the comet in
December 2015.
<p>
The mission is named after the  Rosetta Stone found by French soldiers in
Egypt  in 1799  and  now in the British Museum. Inscribed  on  the stone
is  a  declaration in three  different  languages: Greek,  Egyptian
Demotic  and Hieroglyphics which  were analyzed by both the English
Physicist Thomas Young,  and the French Egyptologist Jean Francois
Champollion who  in 1822  finally succeeded in decrypting  the
Hieroglyphic system. The main structure of the  Rosetta Orbiter is a 2.82
x 12.0m cube shown below and  is powered by two solar panels each  of  which when  fully
extended has an area of 32 m2 and total  span of 32m.

The Rosetta orbiter will be the first
spacecraft ever to go into orbit around a  comet  nucleus and will be the
first  to  observe  the changes  that  occur  in comet activity  as  the
nucleus travels  towards  the inner solar system.  The  orbiter's 
scientific  payload  includes 11 experiments, one of which is the VIRTIS
instrument previously described for Venus Express and a small 90 kg
lander is also included which will  be the first  spacecraft  ever to
make a  soft  landing  on  the surface of a comet nucleus and will focus
on the in  situ study  of  the composition and structure of  the  nucleus
material.
