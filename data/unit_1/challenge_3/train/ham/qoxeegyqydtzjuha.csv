<h1>Daniel Lea</h1>

<p>I'm a postdoc who was working in Oxford in <a
href="http://www.atm.ox.ac.uk">atmospheric
oceanic and planetary physics</a> in the <a
href="http://www.atm.ox.ac.uk/group/ocean/">physical oceanography
group</a>. I've now moved to Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics
Laboratory in Maryland, USA. I still working on Data assimilation,
however.

<p>I was looking at 4D variational assimilation of ERS altimetry and ATSR
radiometric sea surface temperatures into an ocean model. The model used
is a reduced gravity multi-layer shallow water model based on a model
developed in Oxford. </p>

<p>My <a href="thesis.ps.gz">thesis can be downloaded here.</a>
(gzipped postscript).

<p>
My <a
href="report.ps">first year report</a>
contains much more detail on my work. Also here is my
<a href="progress.ps">
second year report</a>.</p>

<p>I've also done some work with the Lorenz(1963) system including testing
the ideas of data assimilation which I will apply to the ocean system. 
Also I have looked at the limitations of sensitivity analysis using the
adjoint method, and possible ways around it. Download a copy of my first 
paper 
<a href="sensitivity.ps">Sensitivity
analysis of the climate of a chaotic system</a> (Tellus A - Oct 2000).

<!p><!There's also 'Waterworld' or what happens to ocean circulation in a
world with no continents; which is pretty boring so far unfortunately.
However I've also just found out about 'Self Organised Criticality' from a
book by Per Bak (lent to me by Tom Haine) which is fantastically exciting.
Basically it is an attempt to understand how complexity arises from very
simple systems. It could be relavant to fluid dynamics and oceanography
and I think it's actually quite deep philosophically as well
as scientifically. I could (and probably will) waste many hours
investigating this!><!/p>

<p>I've helped with the practicals for the spring school on quantitive
earth observation which was held here in Oxford at Easter 1999 and 2000.
Here are some <a href="spring_school.html">notes I wrote for the EO Spring
school. 1999</a></p>
