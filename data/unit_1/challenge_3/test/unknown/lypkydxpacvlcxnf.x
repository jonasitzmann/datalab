	  <p><strong> </strong><strong><a name="intro"></a>INTRODUCTION </strong></p>
	  <p> The part-time Master&rsquo;s in Modernism is a two-year course which provides the opportunity to undertake specialist research in English Literature from 1890 to 1939. The course considers the experimentation with language and form which resulted in the distinctive work of selected writers of the early modern period and the cultural and intellectual context in which that experimentation took place. The course aims to place the literature studied in the social and historical conditions out of which it arose and which in turn it helped to shape. Concepts such as &lsquo;The Modern&rsquo;, &lsquo;Modernist&rsquo; and &lsquo;Post-Modernist&rsquo; are investigated and the course also considers whether such different authors as those studied can be said to belong to a single designated period or movement. It investigates how far Modernism was characterised by radical experimentation and innovation in the arts and how far it may be seen as a period which transmitted a strong humanist tradition from the nineteenth century. Critical theory also forms an integral part of the programme, which encourages student engagement with critical thought of, and about, the period. </p>
	  <p> In the first year the course consists of an initial day-school followed by 24 weekly evening lecture and seminar sessions in the Michaelmas, Lent and Easter terms, as well as a non-residential weekend school. Students write three class essays of 2500 words each (one per term), one of which forms the basis for a seminar presentation. In the second year students undertake independent research on a topic of their choice in consultation with a supervisor from the English Faculty and submit a dissertation of 15,000 words. Master&rsquo;s in Modernism students are members of Colleges and enjoy the full use of the English Faculty and University Libraries as well as the University&rsquo;s other facilities. They are encouraged to attend the English Faculty&rsquo;s graduate research seminars at which members of the Faculty, postgraduate students and visiting speakers present papers for discussion. Students are also entitled to attend the University&rsquo;s public lectures and lectures given in the Faculty of English.</p>
	  <p> The Master&rsquo;s in Modernism is a free-standing degree but can also act as a gateway to further research and a high percentage of graduates have proceeded to doctoral study at other universities as well as in the University of Cambridge.</p>

	  <p><strong><a name="course"></a>THE COURSE</strong></p>
	  <p> Year One begins with an initial Saturday day-school on library use, information technology, bibliography and research methods, including participation in short exercises to ensure that students are familiar with the appropriate techniques required for postgraduate study. The course (of weekly two-hour evening sessions) then proceeds chronologically and the first term covers the late nineteenth century to the First World War, with emphasis on such writers as Conrad, Joyce, the men and women poets of the Great War, and the playwrights who contributed to the rise of modernist drama. The second term, spanning the First World War to 1925, examines the &lsquo;cultural seismology&rsquo; which the war and its aftermath generated and includes D.H. Lawrence, Katherine Mansfield, T.S. Eliot, Pound, and H.D. The third term focuses on the different visions and achievements of Yeats, Woolf and Auden, and the first year concludes with a symposium on &lsquo;Modernism and its Movements&rsquo;.</p>
	  <p> Students are also offered a non-residential weekend school in &lsquo;Modernism and the Arts&rsquo; where literary Modernism is seen as part of a much larger aesthetic which involves poetry, sculpture, architecture and music. The programme explores the degree to which disparate art forms may share philosophical, structural and stylistic principles and it seeks to assess how far English art and music can be seen as modernist. This weekend also includes visits to the Fitzwilliam Museum and Kettle&rsquo;s Yard. </p>
	  <p>In Year Two candidates submit a research proposal on a topic of their choice in the modernist period or arising out of it, and proceed to independent research in close consultation with their supervisors from the Faculty. The second year also offers seminars at which papers are presented by Junior Research Fellows of the Colleges, Visiting Scholars, or final year doctoral candidates whose work is relevant to the course. </p>

	  <strong><a name="staff"></a>TEACHING STAFF</strong></p>
	  <p>The Course Director is Dr Mara Kalnins, Reader in Modern English Literature and Fellow of Corpus Christi College. Lectures and seminars in the first year and supervisions for the second year are undertaken by members of the English Faculty and by other specialists in the field who include:</p>
