This specialist version of the Supporting Learning Foundation Degree is designed for those support workers who are already contributing or wish to develop the provision of high quality PE and/or PSHE in schools. In particular, you will learn how to promote positive attitudes and nurture enthusiasm, how to develop childrens sporting skills and the benefits of an active lifestyle.

You will also be able to help the school gain Healthy School status by learning about childrens health beliefs and attitudes, and ways of empowering children to make healthy behaviour choices. A range of health issues will be covered, 
eg. emotional health and bullying, healthy environments, keeping safe, drug education and staff well-being. However, a particular focus will be placed on healthy eating, drinking and physical activity. You will learn how extended school provision such as breakfast and cooking clubs, after school and holiday activity schemes can make childrens lives happier, healthier, safer and more successful. You will take a selection of other more general modules such as Developing and Learning, Managing Behaviour and Promoting Inclusion.
