Abstract:
</H4>

<p>
Modelling studies have indicated that rising temperatures due to 
anthropogenic greenhouse emissions could have a dramatic effect on the 
mass balance of the Greenland ice sheet, and could eventually cause an 
almost 
complete melting.

In this talk, the results of a GCM modelling study on the possible effects 
of such a melting are discussed.  The talk will concentrate on the changes 
to the atmospheric circulation and the surface physics, and how these 
interact with the ocean.  Possible changes to the local vegetation, and 
the question of whether the ice sheet could regrow following a melting, 
will also be discussed.
