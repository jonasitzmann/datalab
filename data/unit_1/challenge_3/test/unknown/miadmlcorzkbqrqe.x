      <h1 align="center">Turning your Ph.D. into a Monograph</h1>
      <p>Linda Bree (Commissioning Editor, British and European Literature, CUP) 
        and Sophie Goldsworthy (Commissioning Editor, Literature, Media and Culture, 
        OUP) kindly offered a seminar on the subject of publishing monographs 
        on <i><font size="3">09/02/00. </font></i>Linda Bree spoke about the structure 
        of academic publishing, while Sophie Goldsworthy concentrated on the ways 
        in which approaches to publishers should be made. The following document 
        summarises the points made, both in individual presentations and in responses 
        to questions:</p>

      </ul>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <h2><u><a name="structure" id="structure"></a>The Structure of Academic Publishing</u></h2>
      <p>It is important to distinguish between trade publishers (e.g. Macmillan, 
        HarperCollins) and academic publishers. Trade publishers are only likely 
        to be interested in works for which there is likely to be large demand, 
        and which can make a large profit. This means they will not be interested 
        in academic monographs. Most academic publishers are attached to universities 
        and many of them (including CUP and OUP) are charities. They are the best 
        kinds of publisher for you to approach.</p>
      <p>Despite the financial pressure on monographs (sales have decreased significantly 
        over the last 10 years, as library budgets have been cut), the academic 
        monographa study of a single specialised area by one authoris not dead!</p>
      <p>But the market is very small, and this is a point to bear in mind when 
        you come to imagine the audience for which you are adapting your Ph.D. 
        The standard print-run for an academic book is less than 1000. Most sales 
        are to libraries, and the readership which you can realistically expect 
        is academic.</p>
      <p>There is a structural problem facing Ph.D. students who wish to publish 
        their works, of which it is as well to be aware from the very start of 
        your project. The AHRB stipulates that Ph.D.s <b>must </b>be completed 
        within four years; as a result Boards of Graduate Studies and graduate 
        admissions committees are looking for applicants who present very specific 
        projects that can be completed within AHRB constraints. Publishers, on 
        the other hand, are looking for work that addresses broader topics. Very 
        few books are now restricted to one author as their subject (although 
        works on major authors, Eliot, Shakespeare, Chaucer) are still published 
        regularly. It is important to discuss with your supervisor early in the 
        project how you might best reconcile the need to complete a thesis with 
        many publishers wish to print books with a broader focus and appeal. 
      </p>
      <p>When writing your thesis it is very important that you fulfill the requirements 
        for the degree. This means citing a great deal of secondary material in 
        order both to show that you have read it and to show how your thesis differs 
        from it. In printed monographs a lower level of annotation is expected. 
        As you write it is worth keeping a mental note of which footnotes might 
        be cut for the published version. It is also a good idea to have some 
        preliminary sense of which chapters might be cut or expanded, and how 
        you might subsequently extend the range of the dissertation for publication. 
      </p>
      <p>CUP and OUP both publish about 100 literature titles per year; of these 
        70 are monographs, and of these 30-40 were originally doctoral theses. 
        The 100 published are chosen from among hundreds of proposals submitted. 
        The consideration process (i.e. soliciting readers reports etc.) is activated 
        for only a small proportion of submitted typescripts. Your proposal needs 
        to be presented as attractively as possible (as the next section shows) 
        in order to make your project come through this highly competitive process 
        successfully.</p>
      <p>When deciding on a potential publisher, inquire as to whether or not 
        the company has marketing on both sides of the Atlantic (the US will provide 
        the largest market); search out publishers that might have specialised 
        lists appropriate to your field (the best ways to do this are through 
        the Internet, catalogues, bookstores, conference book displays, or discussion 
        with your supervisor). It is always worth approaching a publisher first 
        which has already published a work similar to that which you are proposing. 
        Publishers like to build up a list which has a rationale to it and which 
        appears to have an intellectual centre of gravity.</p>
      <h2><u><a name="approach" id="approach"></a>Approaching a Publisher</u></h2>
      <p>Once you have decided which publisher to approach, how do you set about 
        approaching them?</p>
      <p>The first thing to do is to find out the name of the editor with specific 
        responsibility for your area. This is simply so that you can address your 
        letter properly. Your supervisor may be able to help with a name or two. 
        Many presses websites contain useful contact information. The most important 
        thing to do in the initial approach to a publisher is to show that you 
        know what you are doing: a letter addressed to The Editor, OUP might 
        never reach the right editor, and will in any case make you appear to 
        be unprofessional.</p>
      <p>Proposals should be accompanied by a <b>covering letter</b>. This should 
        contain the following information:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>a very brief outline (1/2 a page) of the book.</li>
        <li>a summary of publications to date, if any.</li>
        <li>a brief statement of the tertiary institutions to which you have been 
          attached, and the name of your supervisor and your Ph.D. examiners. 
          If they have recommended publication, say so.</li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>If you have contact/s with the publishing company, it is a good ideal 
          to name them; so if your supervisor has suggested that you approach 
          a particular publisher, say so. If a member of the Faculty has suggested 
          a particular publisher to you after a graduate seminar, say so.</li>
        <li>a paragraph about competition for the book, and how your book will 
          differ from that competition. When a publishers reader first looks 
          at a typescript it is usually the case that the first question they 
          ask themselves is is this project the product of someone who knows 
          the present state of the discipline and the direction in which the majority 
          of work in the area is taking. This does not mean you should slavishly 
          follow fashion, but that if you are not following fashion you should 
          say what the fashion is and why you plan to depart from it.</li>
        <li>a brief account of how your book will fit in with the list of that 
          publisher.</li>
        <li>You should state the planned readership/s for your book. It is important 
          here to be realistic. It is tempting to suppose that publishers will 
          be more interested in a work which will be attractive to an undergraduate 
          readership. This is not always the case: some monographs will be of 
          interest to third year undergraduates, but these readers will almost 
          certainly not make any impact on the sales of the book. Most monographs 
          will be read by academics. </li>
        <li>You should also give an account of how much revision the thesis will 
          require for publication, and how much you have already accomplished. 
          Most publishers do not published unrevised dissertations, so make it 
          clear the revisions which you have done and those you plan to do.</li>
        <li>Include an up to date curriculum vitae.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Do not send the letter via email; send it as a letter and be sure that 
        it and all the work submitted is polished in content and well-presented. 
        Half-finished footnotes or ragged passages of argument can have a disproportionately 
        adverse influence on publishers readers, who are usually academics accustomed 
        to reviewing published monographs. They will apply more or less the same 
        standards to the work you submit.</p>
      <p>The <b>proposal </b>should be about six sides of A4. It should accompany 
        the cover letter. Keep the language simple. It is not the place to develop 
        arguments in technical detail. It should include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>A brief preliminary account of the argument of the book and how it 
          fits in to the present state of scholarship in the area. </li>
        <li>a contents list.</li>
        <li>chapter abstracts.</li>
        <li>the Introduction and perhaps a sample chapter (often the introduction 
          is enough). </li>
      </ul>
      <p>Publishers often send out small samples of a book to readers to get a 
        preliminary assessment of the viability of a topic. It is perfectly possible 
        to approach the publisher before the whole work of revision is finished 
        (though be sure that all the work you actually submit is in fully-finished 
        form).</p>
      <p>Bear in mind that the process of assessment and sending out to readers 
        is not quick, since busy academics are used as readers by the majority 
        of academic presses. The normal turn-around time is 3 months. It is acceptable 
        to send the proposal to more than one publisher, but the moment you have 
        any positive feedback from one it is ethical to tell the others whom you 
        have approached straight away. It is not a sellers market: you must be 
        very careful not to annoy potential publishers who will have spent money 
        on having your proposal assessed.</p>
      <p>In presenting your proposal you should bear in mind that publishers have 
        at least to break even and margins on academic monographs are very tight. 
        Usually less than a thousand copies are printed. Publishers therefore 
        have to keep strict control of length: most monographs are between 90-110,000 
        words. Works shorter than 70,000 will not seem substantial when printed; 
        works longer than that will be prohibitively expensive. Illustrations 
        should be avoided unless they are absolutely necessary.</p>
      <h3><u><a name="favour" id="favour"></a>Things that can count in your favour</u></h3>
      <ul>
        <li> Having published up to two chapters as articles in reputable, refereed 
          journals might work in your favour.</li>
        <li>Contact with or encouragement from the academic general editor of 
          a series of monographs (some publishers make greater use of series publication 
          than others; if you are approaching a publisher such as CUP which makes 
          relatively significant use of series publication it is as well to think 
          in advance which series your monograph might appear in and who its editors 
          are. These people are likely to be the first to be approached by the 
          publisher about the project)</li>
        <li>Choice of a publisher which prints material directly comparable to 
          the work you propose.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3><u><a name="unfavourable" id="unfavourable"></a>Things that can count against you</u></h3>
      <ul>
        <li> Excessively narrow focus</li>
        <li>Lack of connection to existing scholarly debate</li>
        <li>Sloppy presentation</li>
        <li>Lack of realism about length or audience.</li>
        <li>A title which does not clearly place the project in relation to its 
          target audience.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3><u><a name="neutral" id="neutral"></a>Things which do not matter either way</u></h3>
      <ul>
        <li> It is not a disadvantage to be working in interdisciplinary ways. 
          Neither will work that traverses period boundaries be at a disadvantage. 
          It is worth bearing in mind in both these cases that the work will be 
          sent to readers in <b>both </b>disciplines. Philosophers can be very 
          hard on literary critics who appear to them to lack philosophical rigour. 
          It is vital that you show your familiarity with recent secondary material 
          in all areas covered by an interdisciplinary proposal.</li>
