<h1 class="style1"> Student Accommodation</h1>
<img src="../../Applicants/Images/Acc01.jpg" width="150" height="150" alt="Accommodation" border="1" align="right" class="spacer" /><p> Moving away from home to study in higher education is an exciting time in life. There are new friends to be made, new places to discover and the chance to develop many new interests. An important part of the process is finding somewhere to live and our <a href="mailto:accommo@abertay.ac.uk">Accommodation Office</a> is there to help you find suitable accommodation and to offer advice to help you settle in quickly. <br />
  <br />
  Students new to Dundee normally look for somewhere affordable, comfortable and within daily travelling distance of the University. There are a variety of different types of student residential accommodation, either privately owned or directly leased by the University. 


Staying in any of the University of Abertay&rsquo;s halls of residence means that you can look forward to living in modern comfortable surroundings will all the facilities you need to make your stay enjoyable. </p>
<p>The University&rsquo;s six self-catering residences offer a wide range of high quality accommodation. The size of the accommodation varies from single bedsits to multi-occupancy flats and it is all located within easy walking or travelling distance to the University. The self-catering flats are furnished and are complete with standard kitchen facilities. There are now a significant number of self-catering flats available with en-suite facilities. You can have the added peace of mind of knowing that when you are staying in University accommodation there is a 24hr campus security service and an on-call caretaker.&nbsp; Alloway Halls, where our younger students stay, also have a resident caretaker on site.</p>
<p>The accommodation staff are happy to provide details of the range and prices of accommodation currently available. </p>
<h3 class="style1">Accommodation Policy</h3>
<p>When allocating accommodation the University gives priority to first entrants and to overseas students who are new to Dundee.</p>
<p>For those who do not wish to be placed in the University accommodation, our Accommodation Office staff happy to give information on finding accommodation within the private rented sector.</p>
<h3 class="style1">Living in the University's Residential Accommodation</h3>
<img src="../../Applicants/Images/Acc03.jpg" width="147" height="106" alt="Accommodation" border="1" align="right" class="spacer" />
<p> Living in student residential accommodation is great fun and an ideal opportunity to make friends. In the self-catering flats, which are grouped together on separate sites, students have their own study bedroom and share a communal living/kitchen area. Students therefore have daily contact with the people in their own flats and in the other flats situated on the same site. This provides the ideal environment for arranging nights out and entertainment, while the single study bedrooms provide privacy and an area in which to study and relax. The contract for all residences is for the full duration of the academic session, inclusive of Christmas and Easter vacations, or for one semester for those students attending the University for a single semester.&nbsp; The contract is generally 36-38 weeks duration.</p>
<h3 class="style1">Married Students and Students with Families</h3>
<p> The University has very limited accommodation set aside for married students or students with families. The Accommodation Officers are happy to give advice on finding suitable accommodation in the private sector or in local authority housing. </p>

<p class="style2"> Once the Accommodation Team receives your application, it will be processed in turn.&nbsp; We know you&rsquo;ll be anxious, but you <strong>can&rsquo;t</strong> speed it up by phoning the office, it only slows down the process, so please try to be patient.&nbsp; They will allocate you a room based on your age and the preferences you have made. </p>

<h3 class="style1">Living in Private Rented Flats </h3>
