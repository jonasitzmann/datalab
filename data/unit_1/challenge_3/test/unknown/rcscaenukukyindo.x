<p>
Large-scale convection in planetary or stellar interiors plays a significant role but it is difficult to reproduce the central force field of those systems in experimental studies. A technique to approximate a central force through the magnetic field from a magnet acting on a magnetic liquid paper is present. The thermomagnetic convection in a spherical shell filled with a magnetic liquid is analysed in the context of a terrestrial laboratory using a 2D Finite Element model. Two configurations of magnetic fields were investigated, one resulting in a radially decreasing force field, and the other in a radially increasing force field.

The results suggest that, while the actual force field does not reproduce the central gravity in planetary interiors accurately, it captures the essential qualitative of the flow unlike other terrestrial experiments, which were dominated either by gravity or by a cylindrical radial force field. It is therefore suggested that such an experiment would provide a useful tool to investigate thermal convection in planetary interiors.
