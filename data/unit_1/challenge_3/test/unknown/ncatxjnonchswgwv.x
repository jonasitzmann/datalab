			<P>From 1 October 2006 all children&rsquo;s services &ndash; including schools &ndash; in Brighton &amp; Hove are&nbsp;provided by the Children and Young People&rsquo;s Trust (CYPT).</P>
<P>The CYPT, which is not a separate organisation, is being created by bringing together the council&rsquo;s former Children, Families and Schools directorate with South Downs NHS Health Trust&rsquo;s Children and Families Services. It will work in partnership with other health services and the city&rsquo;s community and voluntary sector.</P>
<P>Schools will play an important role within the CYPT. A <A href="/downloads/education/education_online/key_documents/central_services/children_and_young_peoples_trust/CYPTschoolsbrochure.pdf">special brochure</A> for schools explaining the CYPT's structure is now available. There is also a <A href="/downloads/education/education_online/key_documents/publicleafletFINAL.pdf">leaflet for service-users and the public.</A></P>
<P>The CYPT has its own branding, which everybody is expected to use. This is an important way of signalling the new arrangements and establishing the CYPT. <A href="/downloads/education/education_online/key_documents/central_services/children_and_young_peoples_trust/CYPT_branding_guidelines.pdf">Guidelines</A> have been issued to help staff use the new branding, including the logo. </P>
<P>If you would like a set of logos in jpeg format to use on templates for your letter heads, newsletters etc contact the CYPT&nbsp;Communications Officer, Sue Bowes, on (01273) 291071.</P>
<P>&nbsp;The council's Print and Sign Shop at Hollingdean Depot can supply you with CYPT signs and stationery to order and has all the logos and branding guidelines necessary to do the job. Contact them on (01273) 295888.</P>
<P>There is also a list of <A href="/downloads/education/education_online/key_documents/central_services/Update_on_cypt_hr_contacts_20_Sept_2006.doc">Human Resources contacts </A>for schools.</P>
<P>The city is&nbsp;divided into three Areas &ndash; Central, West and East. Each Area has its own teams, although some services are city-wide. A complete set of area information, including maps, is now available, which you can access by logging on to <U><FONT color=#0000ff><A href="http://www.citystats.org/">www.Citystats.org</A></FONT></U>. </P>
<P>All the maps are on this site &ndash; you don&rsquo;t need to register or use a password to access them. You can search the maps using postcodes. Detailed instructions on using the site are attached below.&nbsp; </P>
<P><STRONG>Instructions for using Citystats website:</STRONG></P>
<P>Go to the main site &ndash; <A href="http://www.citystats.org/">www.citystats.org</A>. Once you are into the site, choose &ldquo;Interactive map&rdquo;</P>
<P>Choose&nbsp; &ldquo;CYPT areas&rdquo; in the Boundaries section in the top right-hand corner of the site &ndash; it&rsquo;s the last option on the list.</P>
<P>Click on &ldquo;update map&rdquo;</P>
<P>You can then type in a postcode and click &ldquo;Go&rdquo;. You can&rsquo;t search by street name at present.</P>
<P>You can zoom in using the metre option underneath the map. If you need to check an address right on the boundary of an area you will need to zoom in a lot to make the street name and numbers visible to clarify which side of the street the address is on, and therefore which area it is in.</P>
