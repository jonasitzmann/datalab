A working data requirements document was produced and distributed to relevant parties .
A data requirements workshop was held at SSLRC in February 2001 to discuss implcations 
and how the datasets would be generated. 
<P>
<IMG SRC="src1.jpg">

<P>
Model simulations using the Rothamsted Carbon Model (RothC) to those using the default soil related coefficient (SRC) 
method were compared for a number of land use transitions, corresponding to 
those used in the GHGEI.  This has shown that the SRC method tends 
to overestimate the loss of Soil carbon in scenarios where soil C is in decline, 
and overestimates the gain in soil carbon where soil C is increasing.
<P>
<IMG SRC="src2.jpg">

<P>
A prototype version of the Rothamsted carbon model for use with land use 
change scenarios was developed.  A review of soil carbon cycling in peat soils was 
conducted, and possible developments of the RothC model, or other alternative models 
for simulating C cycling in peat soils were investigated.  Testing of RothC predictions
 has been completed for a number of sites where grassland has been converted 
to arable land use (Morrow Plots, Illinois; SATWAGL, Australia;Waite Rotation, Australia),
 and shown a good reproduction of observed results in general.
<P>
<IMG SRC="rothc.jpg">
<P>
A prototype interface for running the RothC model with spatial databases 
has been developed, allowing it to access soil, meteorological and land use 
information output from geographic information systems.
<P>
<IMG SRC="morrow.jpg">
<P>
<P>
We have been unable to provide figures for the GHGEI due to lack of data provision 
<P>
Other - ancillary datasets have been collected for use in the project as follows:

A prototype version of the Rothamsted carbon model for use with land use 
change scenarios has been further developed and is ready for 
final implementation when the data becomes available. <P>
A sample soils dataset for an area of Derbyshire has been provided by NSRI (formerly SSLRC).  
This has been used to investigate C inputs to soil required to maintain measured SOC 
stocks for the 0-30cm, 30-100cm and 0-100cm layers, predicted by RothC.  
We also used these data to investigate the effects of using the dominant 
soil type to represent each 1km grid square versus using each component soil type, 
for the 0-30cm, 30-100cm and 0-100cm layers for a) calculating SOC stocks for the 
region and b) predicting SOC changes with RothC for a number of hypothetical land 
use change scenarios.  
<P>
<IMG SRC="cinputs.jpg">
<P>
The use of dominant versus component soils data to calculate 
SOC stocks for the region showed that using only dominant soils information 
leads to significant errors in estimated SOC stocks.  Using the RothC model for highly 
organic soils could also lead to significant errors in SOC stocks.  Estimates of C inputs 
to soil provided by RothC suggested that the model may be inadequate for simulating 
SOC dynamics in highly organic and/or waterlogged soils.  The use of dominant or 
component soils data in conjunction with the RothC model in predicting SOC changes 
under hypothetical land use change scenarios for the region also suggests that using 
dominant soil properties could lead to significant errors in predicted SOC fluxes.
<P>
<IMG SRC="soc.jpg">
<P>
Preliminary investigation of methods for uncertainty analysis has focused on the 
methodologies proposed by the IPCC, namely Monte Carlo analysis and error propagation 
equations.  Analysis of climatic data from the CRU has suggested that the probability
 density functions (PDF's) of monthly temperature and rainfall for the UK are 
not normally distributed but strongly skewed, and the nature of 
the PDF's may vary between months. Analysis of soil C content data from the 
National Soils Inventory has also suggested a non-normal, skewed distribution. 
Further preliminary investigation of uncertainty in model outputs at 
the site and regional scale has been conducted and has been submitted for publication.
<P>
A prototype interface for running the RothC model with spatial databases 
has been developed, allowing it to access soil, meteorological and land use 
information output from geographic information systems, and to output results
in a format compatible with GIS systems.  We have developed test GIS datasets for 
this prototype using climatic data for the UK from CRU and soils data from the National 
Soils Inventory.
<P>
<IMG SRC="cmodel.jpg">
<P>

The Rothamsted Carbon model has been further evaluated for different land management, 
climate and soil type combinations at a number of long term experiments  
in Europe (see publications list).  The prototype GIS-model interface has also been applied to Hungarian datasets for a number of carbon sequestration scenarios.
A working document, 'Allocating the spatial location and timing of land-use change' 
has been written and provided for comment by the steering group.
<P>
We have built a collaboration with the Climate Research Unit at the University of 
East Anglia (Dr David Viner), who will provide and format relevant current/historic 
and future (scenario) climatic data: delivery of these datasets is expected soon.
<P>
We have been unable to provide figures for the GHGEI due to lack of data provision on soils, land use and land use change.

Missing data checks have been completed on the preliminary 1km soils and land use datasets collated by NSRI.  A report on this work has been written and circulated to collaborators, and placed on the project website.  British Isles Climatology and SRES climate change scenario data have been obtained for modelling purposes from CRU-UEA.  These datasets were then processed and formatted for RothC model application at 1km scale. The RothCUK interface program has been created to utilise the 1km soils and land use datasets, and the CRU climate data with the RothC model.  This system is based on the plot/field scale RothC model, and can provide predicted fluxes of C from soil organic carbon or carbon dioxide emissions.  Programs have also been created to process and format climate files for use with the RothCUK interface. 
<P>
<IMG SRC="cinputss.jpg">
<P>
In the first instance, the RothCUK system has been tested with a subset of the preliminary 1km soils and land use datasets to investigate 1) fitting C inputs to measured SOC data, and 2) using default C input values to predict equilibrium SOC stocks, using the dominant soil type and component land use data for the 0-30cm and 30-100cm layers of each 1km square. These runs concentrated on arable, grassland and semi-natural land uses since woodland soils data were not available for the test area.  RothC output data from these runs have been analysed, which has 1) allowed calculation of average C input values for different land uses in the 0-30cm and 30-100cm layers, 2) shown that using default C input values for each land use and soil layer does not allow accurate prediction of measured SOC stocks, and 3) shown that the RothC model may be inappropriate for certain soil types (notably organic soils).  C inputs fitted to measured SOC values were well correlated with mean annual rainfall for grassland soils, but less so for arable soils. Since net primary production is strongly related to mean annual rainfall, better prediction of C input values for the RothC model may be achieved by linking RothC to a plant production model, which would also allow prediction of management effects on above and below ground C cycling. 
<P>
<IMG SRC="climate1s.jpg">
<P>
The RothCUK system has also been used to make preliminary estimates of changes in CO2 emissions from soils under two SRES climate change scenarios, A1f1 and B1, for the period 1961-2099, relative to the 1961-1990 baseline climate.  These initial scenarios showed that increased CO2 emissions would be expected from most arable soils after about 2050, with the greatest losses occuring from soils containing more organic matter.  Further simulations are needed to make concrete conclusions, and linkage with plant C cycling models will be necessary for predicting the interaction of  plant and soil C cycling under climate change. 
<P>
<IMG SRC="climate2s.jpg">
<P>
C fluxes have been modelled with RothC under observed land use change (1990-2000) for four test squares from the Countryside Survey data. These outputs have been compared with the soil related coefficient/ Monte Carlo method currently used for the Land Use, Land Use Change and Forestry Emissions Inventory.  RothC estimates of C fluxes for the various land use change options were generally within the range predicted by the Monte Carlo/Soil related coefficient method.  We have more confidence in the RothC method since it accounts for local climate, land use and soil type, and thus can provide more specific estimates of local decomposition rate constants, and hence predicted C fluxes. Initial RothC runs in the four test squares assumed instantaneous land use changes, although later work concentrated on succession and intermediate land use changes.  This is of importance when considering land use changes which take a considerable time to occur, for example natural woodland regeneration on arable land would not naturally occur as a direct transition from arable to woodland, but through arable to grassy weeds, to scrubland and finally woodland succession.  This work showed that the long-term trajectory of carbon flux under land use change was not greatly affected by intermediate land uses, but in contrast, strong effects were observed in the short term (up to 10 years or so), which would be of great importance in inventory calculations and Kyoto Protocol reporting.  Outputs of C input values from the CENTURY model (which incorporates above ground vegetation C dynamics) for woodland vegetation succession runs were also used to drive RothC runs, although the output C fluxes were similar to those using step changes in intermediate land uses with RothC C input values.  The quality and quantity of C inputs during early land use change succession is important in determining the short-term trajectory of C fluxes.  A set of suggested land use change scenarios for possible land use changes under the categories recognised by the 1km soils and land use database have been created for testing with the RothC model.  
<P>
Comparisons were also made between soil C changes predicted for gradual and instantaneous land use changes using the RothC model and the soil related coefficient method over 10 year timescales for the test squares.  Where applicable, intermediate land use changes (not just initial and final land uses) should be accounted for in further modelling, and future work would benefit from linkage with plant production models.
<P>
<IMG SRC="RothC_SRCs.jpg">
<P>
Version two of the 1km soils and land use database has been received from NSRI, and preliminary missing data checks on these datasets had begun. A collaboration with the Hadley Centre has been developed for prediction of climate change effects on soil carbon stocks. The aim of this work will be to include the RothC model in the HADCM3 climate model, which currently has a very simple soil carbon model, to enable more accurate prediction of changes in ecosystem carbon stocks and climate feedbacks under climatic and land use change.
Collaboration with a GEF-funded project Assessement of soil carbon stocks at national scale has also been initiated, which will promote work on inventory method development with the NREL group at Colorado State University (using the CENTURY model) in case study countries, and a BBSRC ISIS exchange grant has been obtained to harmonize approaches between Rothamsted Research and NREL.
The project website has been updated, and reports and information can be downloaded.
