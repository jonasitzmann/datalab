<center><h1><FONT COLOR=#008000>About the Statistics Department</FONT></h1></center>

Our aim is to be at the forefront of statistical research, while providing a statistical service for the needs of the Institute and the scientific community. There are five interacting themes:

<h2>Research into new methods of analysis</h2>

Our current research covers several areas of biometry, applied statistics and mathematical modelling that underpin agricultural research. Areas of research currently under investigation include:
<p>
<ul>
<img src=/common/images/bluedot.gif>New ways of fitting complex curves and surfaces to data, and interpreting 
the results. These are needed to understand how yields vary with fertilizer 
amounts, how plants grow, and in many other applications.	<br />
<img src=/common/images/bluedot.gif>The study of spatial variation and the effect this has on how we conduct 
experiments and interpret sampling results.<br />
<img src=/common/images/bluedot.gif>The best way of analysing data when variability comes from many sources, 
such as measurement error at one level, and field variability at another.<br />
<img src=/common/images/bluedot.gif>Novel approaches to disease modelling and risk assessment.
</ul>
<p>

<h2>Statistical Liaison</h2>

Scientists and statisticians work together to agree on the best ways of designing experiments and recording data, on fitting suitable statistical or mathematical models to the results, and in presenting the conclusions for 
publication in high-quality journals and for presentation at conferences. Without proper statistical advice much effort can be wasted in conducting investigations which cannot lead to valid conclusions. This may lead to a scientist's work not being recognized, or to incorrect conclusions having to 
be withdrawn at a later stage.
<p>
IACR statisticians work not only with scientist colleagues on site, but also with other agricultural institutes, to provide statistical training, advice and research. Three of the statisticians in the department are based at IACR-Long Ashton Research Station and collaborate extensively with scientists there, as well as providing formal statistical teaching as part of an MSc course in Crop Protection. One of our statisticians, based at Rothamsted, specializes in giving advice overseas, particularly in tropical and sub-tropical countries. The Department regularly receives visitors, Rothamsted International fellows and research students.
<p>

<h2>Large-scale projects</h2>

The Department is involved in several large-scale projects, such as modelling the effects of weather, pollution and aero-allergens on asthma attack incidence, and the parsimonious modelling of winter-wheat yields based on 
weather variations. The archiving of our historical data is an ongoing project. This involves the compilation of relevant long-term data from surveys and experiments at Rothamsted, particularly the so-called classical experiments, into a secure electronic database - the Electronic Rothamsted Archive. We have been able to reanalyse this data with particular regard to studies of environmental change, which require long runs of data.
<p>

<h2>Statistical Software Development</h2>

Statisticians in the department are involved in the development of <A HREF="http://www.vsni.co.uk/products/genstat/" >
GenStat</a>, which is a powerful and flexible statistical system. The <A HREF="http://www.vsni.co.uk/products/genstat/" >GenStat</a> system offers the user the benefits of a fully interactive system with extensive graphical facilities, plus a menu system. It has a long history of successful use and is continuously updated and improved to ensure that it remains at the forefront of statistical
technology. GenStat is currently distributed by <a href="http://www.vsni.co.uk/">VSN International Ltd</a> to over 1000 sites worldwide and is Europe's only widely distributed general purpose statistical system.  Recently, in an EU-funded project the GenStat algorithms have been incorporated into a new exciting visual programming environment, <a href="stable/tstable.html">STABLE</a>. Other statistical software produced by the department includes MLP (Maximum Likelihood Program) and Genkey (General Program for Diagnostic Keys).
<p>

<h2>Overseas Development</h2>

The Overseas Development Section is responsible for biometric work in developing countries. It runs multidisciplinary research projects for funding agencies such as the European Commission, the Rockefeller Foundation and the Department for International Development, as well as providing consultancies to overseas organizations. The section has strong links with a wide range of institutes overseas and receives visitors for short study periods. The section is responsible for running the <a href="uniquaims/aen_uniquaims.html">UNIQUAIMS Project</a>, which is a concerted action between many European and developing countries, working on renewable natural resources programmes.
