<H2>Dobson Room - detailed information about the slide projectors</H2>

<p><h3>PRIME and BACKUP PROJECTORS:</h3>

<p>There are two very similar Zeiss Ikon 35 mm slide projectors. They take
the straight 'toast rack' type of carrier, of which several are available. Both
landscape and portrait images fit easily onto the central screen. 

<p>Use the projector marked PRIME if possible. This should have the big fixed long
focal length large aperture lens. 

<p>If the bulb blows, switch to BACKUP machine and tell Keith Riley, the Physics
AV technician. Note that remote focussing does not work on the backup.


<p><h3>THIN SLIDES:</h3>

<p>With thin cardboard slides the changing finger sometimes slips past the slide
(and could damage it). Find a tall volunteer to feed these manually from above,
i.e. not from the toast rack carriage, or manually very carefully from the
toast rack, pushing the plastic finger over by hand. 


<p><h3>REMOTE CONTROL:</h3>

<p>Focussing and slide change are controlled by a remote control from the dais.
A short push on the round button advances the slide; a long push makes it go
back one. Remote focussing is only possible with the PRIME projector. 

<p>If you change projectors you need to swap the remote control plug over to the
requisite projector. If the remote control doesn't work make sure that it is
plugged into the right projector. 

<p>There is a spare controller which plugs into the trailing socket. 

<p>Slide changing and focussing can be done from the back of the room by plugging
in the spare controller or by turning the lens and moving the slide changer
manually. 

<p>If the slides change themselves automatically, switch off the autochange
timer. This is a round knob on the backup projector only. 

<p>If focussing or changing still occurs of its own accord it is probably due to
a faulty remote controller, so unplug it and either replace it with the spare
or have a person operate the machine from the back of the room. This happened
once when the controller was trodden on and the switches damaged.

<p>There is an extension lead for the remote control; this enables operation
from anywhere in the room (or a much larger room).

<p><h3>LENSES:</h3>

<p>If you use the BACKUP you can swap the lenses; if you do so also take the
bracket that supports the big lens otherwise its weight strains the projector.
For just a few slides it probably is not worth changing the lenses. The
smaller lens is a zoom and you may need to adjust the focal length. 


<p><h3>DUAL PROJECTION:</h3>

<p>Slides can be shown at the same time on both screens, with the big fixed focus
lens for the smaller side screen (with some minor clipping with portrait
orientation), and the zoom lens for the central screen. Both could be remotely
controlled, using the controller extension lead for one of them. 

<p>Slides can be shown on the central screen at the same time as viewgraphs on the
side screen with the lower power overhead projector, and both are of comparable
brightness. 

<p>Slides on the side screen (using the fixed focus lens) and viewgraphs on the
central screen with the high intensity overhead projector is only successful
if the slides are very bright.


<p><h3>MAINS ELECTRICITY:</h3>

<p>The projectors should normally left with their mains switches on and plugged
into the double socket nearest the door with the requisite socket being left on.
This socket is switched from the dais (switch on when you want to show slides).

<p>The mains switch for the BACKUP projector is on its rear. 

<p>There is also a master switch containing a fuse under the window by the dais;
this should be left on. Hence to operate the projector four switches must be on.

<p>If the projector doesn't work and you suspect that mains electricity is not
reaching it then try plugging it into the double socket further from the door;
this is a conventional socket that is powered all the time. 

<p><h3>BULBS:</h3>

<p>These are difficult to change; note that the bulb is of the same type as
fits the standard overhead projector (24 V 240 W), so a spare should be
available in the room.


<p><h3>MELTING SLIDES:</h3>

<p>If slides melt (this has happened), switch to the other machine and report the
problem. It means that the heat filter is missing or broken.
