Abstract:
</H4>

<p>
In this talk I shall review the features of a class of balanced models,
which
are frequently used in geophysical fluid dynamics, that make these
models
amenable to solution both analytically and numerically. Recent
developments,
based on the use of complex manifold theory, in understanding the
relationship
between a hierarchy of Monge-Ampere equations arising in potential
vorticity
inversion and the invariant properties of the corresponding dynamical
systems,
will be presented. Proposals for improving the design of data
assimilation
schemes and sub-grid models, based on these developments, will be
summarized.
