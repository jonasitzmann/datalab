<a name="intro"><h3>Introduction</h3></a>

<P>The Department develops and builds space instruments to study the
atmospheres of the Earth and the planets of the Solar System.  Data
analysis for experiments already in space involves sophisticated
radiative transfer and information retrieval theory, and applications
aimed at an improved understanding of global dynamics, composition and
energy balance and their evolution.  Theoretical and modelling groups
in the areas of middle atmosphere dynamics, physical oceanography,
nonlinear processes and geophysical and planetary fluid dynamics study
fundamental atmospheric processes, and carry out laboratory
experiments on rotating fluids.

<a name="space"><h3>Space Experiments</h3></a>

<P>During the past year we delivered flight hardware for the Composite Infra-Red Spectrometer on the Cassini Saturn orbiter, which will launch in 1997 and arrive at the ringed planet in 2004.  The Oxford-built part of this US-French-British instrument is a custom-designed cooler and associated cryogenic system which maintains the detector arrays at liquid nitrogen temperature using a passive radiator.  The CIRS investigation focuses on Saturn's largest moon Titan, which has a deep, cloudy atmosphere which resembles the primitive Earth's in many ways.  A Titan model atmosphere is being developed to help plan the investigation and, later, to analyse the data; this includes photochemical modelling of cloud production and the vertical distributions of minor constituents.  Further development of the Titan model will continue during the cruise phase of the Cassini mission.
<P>
Flight hardware production is now switching to rebuilding the PMIRR (Pressure Modulator Infra-Red Radiometer) experiment to investigate the present-day climate of the planet Mars.  The original instrument was lost on Mars Observer in 1993, but a replacement will be launched on Mars Surveyor in 1998.  At Oxford, we are working on the detectors, transmitting optics and pressure modulators.  The reflecting optics are being developed in Russia.  A proposal for a similar experiment at Venus is being proposed as part of the NASA series of 'Discovery' missions.
<P>
In 1988 we initiated a UK-US joint project to build the High Resolution Dynamics Limb Sounder (HIRDLS), supported in the UK by the Natural Environmental Research Council.  This is an infrared limb sounding instrument to measure temperature, geopotential height and concentrations of minor constituents in the Earth's upper troposphere, stratosphere and mesosphere.  The instrument will measure at a much higher spatial resolution than has been possible before, enabling dynamical and chemical phenomena with a fine structure (such as mixing) to be studied.    The System Concept Review was held this year, although there have since been design changes to reduce the mass.  The launch is planned for 2002 on the NASA EOS Chemistry-1 satellite. Work has begun on upgrading the calibration facility at Oxford by installing a vacuum chamber containing a seismically isolated optical table, and on building ground support equipment and blackbody targets for in-flight calibration.  An important requirement is to maintain absolute radiometric calibration to 1% or better, which requires measurements of blackbody temperatures to within tens of mK over a period of nearly ten years. Such accuracy was achieved in the ATSR programme, but for shorter periods.  With GEC-Marconi we are developing gyroscopes which will control the alignment of the instrument's optical axis relative to the Earth's limb to about 1 arcsec over half an orbit period (50 minutes).  
<P>
Flight hardware designed and built at Oxford has been delivered to the University of Toronto and integrated into the MOPITT ('Measurements of Pollution in the Troposphere') instrument, which is now being tested and calibrated in Canada before launch in 1998.  Plans are being made for data analysis to map the distribution of carbon monoxide and methane near the Earth's surface, and to investigate their global and seasonal cycles of production and removal from the atmosphere.
<P>
The Tropospheric Emission Spectrometer (TES) is a cooled Michelson interferometer which will make highly detailed measurements of the composition and temperature of the lower atmosphere.  In a collaboration with the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, we are designing the on-board radiometric and spatial calibration targets.  The former in particular presents interesting challenges for an instrument with much higher spectral resolution than a filter radiometer, and will include a thermoelectric cooler to give a wide operating temperature range and so permit on-orbit instrument linearity checks. We are also carrying out simulations and sensitivity studies of the retrieval of atmospheric constituents, including ozone and its precursors.  A related ground-based project involves using an interferometer supplied by Perkin Elmer to make spectroscopic measurements of urban pollution in Oxford. 
<P>
New experiments under development include a visible-infrared imaging spectrometer (VIRTIS) for the European ROSETTA mission to comet Wirtanen, with groups in Rome, Berlin, and Paris.  It combines high spatial resolution spectral mapping aimed particularly at investigating the composition of the solid nucleus and the ice and dust grains given off, with high spectral resolution, capable of identifying the gases in the coma and their physical state.  The requirement to cool the two focal planes to below 80K has led to a programme at Oxford to develop a new subminiature mechanical cooler, which will complement the heavier and more powerful coolers which we developed ten years ago and which are now being used extensively on scientific and commercial space missions around the world through a licensing arrangement with British industry.

<a name="atmosjm"><h3>The Atmospheres of Jupitor and Mars</h3></a>

<P>After its launch in 1989, and a six year interplanetary cruise, the Galileo spacecraft arrived at its final destination, Jupiter, on December 7th, 1995. After deploying a separate entry probe, the main spacecraft went into the planned, highly elliptical orbit about the planet. Oxford is part of the international team which provided the Near Infrared Mapping Spectrometer (NIMS) on board the orbiter which measures the infrared spectrum from 0.7 - 5.2 microns. The data from the probe have provided the first ever in situ measurements of the conditions in the Jovian atmosphere and have given a tantalising glimpse of a single region of that planet. NIMS data began to arrive in June 1996, and analysis is underway using advanced radiative transfer codes which simulate the complex, scattering processes in Jupiter's cloudy atmosphere. This model, combined with optimal estimation retrieval code also developed in Oxford, is providing new estimates of cloud heights and properties together with the abundances of gases such as methane and ammonia. To assist in this analysis, we continue to investigate the spectral characteristics of these gases at the low temperatures found in the Jovian atmosphere, using the spectroscopy facility at Rutherford Appleton Laboratory.  
<P>
While the NIMS measurements of Jupiter will provide the core of the group's work in the near future, parallel projects are taking place to investigate the atmospheres of other planets. Oxford is part of an international team (with other members in London and Canada) analysing the infrared spectra of Saturn and Titan measured by the Infrared Space Observatory (ISO). Simulations of the infrared spectrum of Titan, the largest of Saturn's moons and a key target of the forthcoming Cassini mission, are being conducted to assist in the mission planning of that project and also to compare to recent observations by ground-based telescopes.  Oxford is also a member of the team bidding to use ISO to measure the far-IR spectrum of Mars and in addition is performing a sensitivity study to optimise the design of a new orbiting Mars spectrometer.

<a name="sat"><h3>Satellite Studies of Middle Atmospheres</h3></a>

<P>A set of nine papers describing the validation of the public domain version of the data from the Improved Stratospheric and Mesospheric Sounder (ISAMS) has appeared in a special issue of the Journal of Geophysical Research devoted to the Upper Atmosphere Research Satellite (UARS).  The data, which includes measurements of temperature, the concentrations of CO, H<SUB>2</SUB>O, N<SUB>2</SUB>0, O<SUB>3</SUB>, NO<SUB>2</SUB>, CH<SUB>4</SUB>, N<SUB>2</SUB>O<SUB>5</SUB> and aerosol extinction at 12.1 and 6.2 &#181;m, has been widely disseminated and used; it is available from the Mission to Planet Earth Distributed Active Archive Center at Goddard Spaceflight Center (GSFC), and also on CD-ROM from the UARS project at GSFC.  Work has continued on the improvement of the quality of the data already made public, and the addition of the more challenging constituents, NO and HNO3.  It is anticipated that the data will be reprocessed once more in the near future to create a final version.
<P>
8 papers were presented at the 31st COSPAR Scientific Assembly in Birmingham, in the sessions on Middle Atmosphere and on Reference Atmospheric Trace Constituent Models.  The group also presented publications on stratospheric aerosols and chemistry at the 18th Quadrennial Ozone Symposium and on retrieval techniques at meetings of the Society of Photo-Optical Instrument Engineers and the International Radiation Symposium.
<P>
The reference atmosphere and validation work involving comparisons to other measurements has helped to evaluate possible systematic errors in the data. The conclusions have shown that ISAMS data for CH<SUB>4</SUB> and N<SUB>2</SUB>O have been revised downwards in absolute value and both species are now in line with in situ sampling of the atmosphere.  The global nature and internal consistency of the data on these long-lived tracers has provided the opportunity to examine dynamical phenomena such as the intrusion of mid-latitude air into the tropics.
<P>
Departures from local thermodynamic equilibrium (non-LTE) of the vibrational states of several of the emitting molecules have been under study, in collaboration with colleagues at the Institute of Astrophysics, Granada, and the Rutherford Appleton Laboratory, both in order to understand the physics of the processes, and to improve the quality of the data retrieved from ISAMS.  For example, water vapour in the upper stratosphere and mesosphere is subject to non-LTE emissions in the daytime, so a model of the processes involved is being implemented to provide retrievals of this species. Ozone is subject to chemically-induced non-LTE, since it is initially formed in a range of vibrationally excited states, and more needs to be known about the mechanisms involved in the excitation. The retrieval of CO, which has a large non-LTE emission in the mesosphere in the daytime, has been improved by calculating the source function from the retrieved temperature profile, rather than from standard temperature profiles, as previously.
<P>
The difficulty of measuring many of the nitrogen species has provided some interesting retrieval problems over the past few years. A model of non-LTE emission in the thermosphere from nitric oxide has been developed in order to carry out a stable retrieval of the NO mixing ratio in the stratosphere. Although preliminary, these data represent the first global, local time dependent data available for stratospheric NO.  By showing that the retrieved NO data are consistent with the diurnal variation of NO<SUB>2</SUB>, which was measured at the same time, the combined datasets provide a powerful tool for testing model predictions.
<P>
The development of the first global retrievals of N<SUB>2</SUB>O<SUB>5</SUB> is also worth highlighting.  These ISAMS data, combined with our measurements of temperature, NO<SUB>2</SUB> and HNO<SUB>3</SUB> allow some detailed studies of nitrogen chemistry to be performed. Reservoir species chemistry (N<SUB>2</SUB>O<SUB>5</SUB> and HNO3) has been considered in most detail so far.  We have demonstrated, in collaboration with UARS colleagues, the temperature sensitivity of N<SUB>2</SUB>O<SUB>5</SUB> concentrations and its importance in disturbed dynamical conditions. We have compared ISAMS observations with models of the local time dependence of N<SUB>2</SUB>O<SUB>5</SUB> and have shown that at night-time the observed and predicted behaviours are consistent.  In addition we have demonstrated that it is possible to infer NO<SUB>3</SUB> abundance from the N<SUB>2</SUB>O<SUB>5</SUB> measurements even when NO<SUB>3</SUB> is not in a steady state.  Observations of N<SUB>2</SUB>O<SUB>5</SUB> and HNO<SUB>3</SUB> are now being combined with other UARS data to examine the their partitioning when heterogeneous chemistry is important.
<P>
Stratospheric aerosol continues to be a very fruitful area of study using data from ISAMS and other UARS instruments. 
The extinction observed by ISAMS changes as aerosols cool and absorb water, which reduces its value as a tracer of atmospheric motion.  Removal of this effect by converting the observed aerosol volume density into a liquid sulphate density gives a quantity which is relatively invariant with temperature and is a useful tracer of atmospheric motion.
<P>
ISAMS observed aerosols with very small particle sizes in the high latitude upper stratosphere in regions of cold air, probably due to condensation of sulphuric acid which has been evaporated elsewhere in warmer regions.  The large surface area produced appears to be important in heterogeneous chemistry giving rise to an enhanced nitric acid content. Estimates of aerosol surface area are being used with gas concentration measurements by other UARS instruments to study the heterogeneous reactions involving aerosols.  Preliminary calculations imply the heterogeneous hydrolysis of N<SUB>2</SUB>O<SUB>5</SUB> to form HNO<SUB>3</SUB> observed within the atmosphere occurs more slowly than lab measurements imply.
<P>
Data from ISAMS and another UARS instrument, CLAES, have been used to study the global evolution of the Mount Pinatubo volcanic aerosols, including the position and motion of the centre and boundaries of the tropical stratospheric reservoir.  The results show that the cloud material was initially transported into the southern hemisphere and that the global mass loading decayed with a time constant of 342 &plusmn; 8 days.  The maximum aerosol surface area density of the volcanic cloud was shown to reach 50 &#181;m<SUPER>2</SUPER>cm<SUPER>-3</SUPER> in October 1991, about two orders of magnitude more than pre-eruption levels. ISAMS data have also been used to study synoptic scale polar stratospheric clouds and have shown their composition to be consistent with ternary HNO<SUB>3</SUB>-H<SUB>2</SUB>SO<SUB>4</SUB>-H<SUB>2</SUB>0 solutions. Finally, ISAMS data have been used to estimate the aerosol extinction spectrum and so deduce atmospheric heating rates.  The aerosols have been shown to affect the residual circulation in the stratosphere and lower mesosphere, although large uncertainties in the refractive index of cold sulphuric acid solutions limit the accuracy of the results.
<P>
The retrieval of water vapour and air density from the occultation radiometer experiment, built in the department and flown on the EURECA platform, has been completed. Water and temperature distributions were obtained from 50 to 80 km, over a period of about 12 months, and were validated by comparisons with the HALOE instrument on UARS.
<P>
We are preparing a reference model for the accurate computation of high resolution spectra to be used by the Michelson Interferometer for Passive Atmospheric Sounding (MIPAS), a European instrument due to fly on ENVISAT-1.  MIPAS will measure thermal emission from the limb of the atmosphere at high spectral resolution in order to obtain the distributions of temperature and a wide range of constituents.  

<a name="gpfd"><h3>Geophysical and Planetary Fluid Dynamics</h3></a>

<P>The development of advanced general circulation models (GCMs) of Mars has continued in collaboration with the Laboratoire de Meteorologie Dynamique (LMD) at the Ecole Normale Superieure in Paris.  A new phase of development to extend the capabilities of the model in terms of its spatial resolution and range of physical processes represented was completed, including a new and comprehensive validation exercise of test simulations against a wide cross-section of available observations of Mars' atmosphere and surface.  The new version of the model runs at a spectral resolution of T31, equivalent to a grid resolution of around 200 km, with 20 vertical levels on a terrain-following co-ordinate system.  New parameterisations include a sub-gridscale orographic drag scheme (including the effects of unresolved breaking gravity waves), an improved representation of polar processes  associated with the condensation and sublimation of CO<SUB>2</SUB>, a novel parameterization of the radiative effects of suspended dust in the atmosphere, and an advanced parameterization of the planetary boundary layer.
<P>
A detailed intercomparison of the Martian GCMs of various  groups from the USA and Europe culminated in a three-day workshop in July 1996, hosted in Oxford, at which experts from NASA Ames Research Center, JPL, GFDL  Princeton, NASA Goddard Institute for Space Studies, Washington State University, University of Texas, LMD, University of Granada (Spain) and Oxford reviewed the current status of atmospheric modelling for Mars. Recent models have achieved a considerable degree of success in obtaining quite realistic simulations of the climate of Mars (at least as observed to date), but a number of directions were identified in which further progress may be made in improving their performance and methods for their validation.
<P>
A programme of climate simulations using the new GCMs has now begun with the aim of producing a climate database for ESA which can be used by spacecraft engineers and mission scientists planning future missions to Mars.  Scientific studies investigating the Martian climate as simulated in these models have included studies of the effects of orographically generated gravity waves on the large-scale circulation, zonal jets excited by the thermal tide on Mars, and other effects of the diurnal cycle.  A new project was started in collaboration with the Mathematics Institute to use Empirical Orthogonal Function (EOF) methods to obtain reduced dimensional dynamical models of large-scale phenomena in Mars' atmosphere from analyses of full climate simulations with the main GCM.
<P>
The development and validation of a meteorological data assimilation scheme for the Martian atmosphere has made excellent progress with the implementation of a new version to assimilate remotely-sensed and in situ observations directly into our comprehensive Mars GCM.  A range of test assimilations, carried out using data derived from other model simulations under very different conditions, has demonstrated a capability to achieve accurate reconstructions of the original atmospheric state and evolution under quite realistic conditions, given a sufficient density of observations. 
<P>
The development of models of jets and large eddies in the Jovian atmosphere, in sufficient detail for comparison with Galileo observations, has included a stationary diagnostic model of a prototype large oval eddy. This is based on the primitive equations of dynamical meteorology on isentropic co-ordinates in gradient wind and hydrostatic balance, and allows the investigation of possible eddy structures spanning the stratosphere and upper troposphere of Jupiter to a depth of several tens of bars.  The structure of potential vorticity anomalies compatible with observations above the clouds and with both deep and shallow hypotheses for the depth to which the eddies penetrate below the visible clouds have been obtained.  These solutions may be useful in interpreting observations of Jupiter and in evaluating possible physical mechanisms for generating and maintaining such potential vorticity anomalies.  Work is now under way to extend these studies by developing a fully time-dependent dynamical model of Jupiter's stratosphere and upper troposphere, derived from a unified model of the Earth's atmosphere provided by the Meteorological Office.
<P>
Laboratory studies enable the investigation of a wide range of dynamical instabilities and other processes and are highly complementary to more conventional modelling studies in dynamical meteorology and oceanography. A further series of measurements of thermal properties and velocity fields in the  thermally-driven rotating annulus was completed, including measurements in a fluid  with lower Prandtl number (Pr ~ 12) than used hitherto.  Phenomena investigated include a multi-mode regime in which two initially distinct wavenumber states were observed to interact and intermittently exchange dominance of the flow in a form of attractor merging process. This phenomenon is most prominent in fluids of high Prandtl number, though some complex multi-mode interactions were also found in the lower Pr experiments, confirming the results of earlier experiments.  These phenomena evidently lead to very low frequency chaotic oscillations in the flow, and may represent a generic means of generating slow variability in any rotating stratified fluid system, including planetary atmospheres.
<P>
A study of nonlinear barotropic instability made good progress, using a new  apparatus to generate a detached barotropic shear layer in a rotating homogenous fluid.  The flow was observed to generate sequences of eddies through barotropic instability, and laser-Doppler measurements of radial velocity have shown that the flow exhibits a rich bifurcation structure as experimental parameters are varied, including period- doubling cascades and intriguing regions of parameter space where the flow breaks down discontinuously into fully three-dimensional turbulent motion.  Work is currently under way to investigate the spatial structure of these flows using particle-tracking methods.
<P>
A programme of experiments to investigate baroclinic instabilities in a two-layer stratified rotating annulus has also continued this year, using some novel methods of flow visualisation and analysis which exploit the wavelength-dependent properties of optical activity in one of the fluid layers.  By illuminating the flow from below with a diffuse white-light source and viewing the system from above between crossed  polaroids, dynamically-induced variations in the height of the interface appear as changes in the colour transmitted.  This technique has proved invaluable in revealing an unprecedented wealth of detail within the two-layer baroclinic flows, including the discovery of a novel flow regime at low bulk Richardson number in which time-dependent large-scale baroclinic waves were observed to generate trains of short wavelength inertia-gravity waves in regions of locally strong shear.  This may represent an significant new means of studying the interaction of these two important types of wave mode, with potential implications for the formulation of atmospheric models and data assimilation methods.
<P>
Theoretical studies in collaboration with colleagues at the Mathematics Institute in Oxford included a new nonlinear bifurcation analysis of a prototype two-layer baroclinic instability model with a single wave interacting with a zonal flow.  This demonstrated that the sequences of bifurcations observed in this system are all organised about a single point (a degenerate Takens-Bogdanov point) in parameter space.  This analysis has provided some new insights, unifying the results of a number of disparate theoretical studies in the previous literature which made various restrictive assumptions in different asymptotic limits.  Good progress has also been made in developing methods to obtain optimal low-dimensional models of baroclinic wave regimes from measured time series in the laboratory, via EOF-Galerkin techniques.  These studies aim to investigate the dynamics especially of the complex multi-mode baroclinic wave regimes mentioned above, and are highly complementary to the EOF-Galerkin studies of the circulation of the Martian atmosphere within the group.

<a name="atmos"><h3>Middle Atmosphere Dynamics</h3></a>

<P>The Middle Atmosphere Modelling group uses several numerical models to study dynamical and transport processes in the stratosphere and mesosphere, with a particular interest in interpreting satellite data. Our contribution to the UK Universities' Global Atmospheric Modelling Programme (UGAMP) includes a number of studies involving a sophisticated numerical model of the atmosphere up to altitudes of about 90 km, and comparisons with observed features.  In collaboration with scientists at Reading University we have found a '2-day wave' in the model.  This is a mainly mesospheric phenomenon that has been known observationally for many years; our simulation is apparently the first good representation of the 2-day wave in a GCM.  Other dynamical features studied in the model include the structure and evolution of the '4-day wave' and the diurnal tide, and the evolution and control by gravity-wave drag of the cold summer mesopause.
<P>
Comparisons with ISAMS measurements have been made, for both Northern and Southern hemispheres, with a high-resolution chemical-transport model (SLIMCAT) and a contour advection model, to simulate the transport in the lower stratosphere of sulphuric acid associated with volcanic aerosol. The effects of particle sedimentation have been included in the model.  The simulations show small-scale features not readily observable with current observational techniques. An interesting example of isentropic transport into the tropics of the middle stratosphere was found in water vapour, ozone and nitrous oxide data from UARS, which has been modelled using contour advection and domain-filling trajectories, driven by horizontal winds from the Met Office assimilation model, and diabatic vertical winds.  We have found statistically significant pole-equator temperature anticorrelations in the middle and upper stratosphere, by analysing ISAMS and model temperatures; we are investigating whether these are associated with periods of enhanced global meridional circulation.
<P>
The series of experiments with the Meteorological Office Stratosphere-Mesosphere Model (SMM), involving comparison with the 1991-92 northern winter as observed by ISAMS, has now been completed. Use of the SMM to model equatorial waves in the lower stratosphere continues. This year we have focused on getting the model to run at a higher vertical resolution (1 km), in order to model various classes of vertically propagating waves which are thought to be significant in the driving of the QBO.  The model is now performing well at the higher resolution, and experiments are being performed in which different classes of waves are forced in the model, and the response to these waves observed.

<a name="ocean"><h3>Physical Oceanography</h3></a>

<P>Work with the intermediate coupled model of the tropical Pacific ocean/atmosphere system has continued.  The ocean initial state from which an El Nino Southern Oscillation forecast is begun, is obtained by integrating the model using the past history of the windstress.  This poorly observed quantity is improved by deriving a statistical relationship between observed sea surface temperature (SST) and observed stress, then using the SST as input to the statistical atmosphere to derive a new filtered wind stress which was used to force the ocean model.  The ocean model response was much improved by this procedure and the resulting forecasts improved also.  A small further improvement was obtained by blending this filtered windstress with the observed, especially at higher latitudes where the statistical relationship breaks down.  Further refinements to the initialisation procedure for the coupled model are being tested, involving assimilation of SST into the model, and adaptive techniques for defining anomalies relative to a changing mean climatology resulting from model drift.  Results of studies to quantify the predictability of the forecasts show that SST is most sensitive to error in the central east Pacific.
<P>
The European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasting has just completed a 15 year re-analysis of atmospheric conditions from 1979 to 1993, providing a stable method of assimilating data into an atmospheric model.  This re-analysis provides consistent fluxes of momentum, heat and fresh water. To test their usefulness, a high resolution tropical Indo-Pacific ocean GCM has been forced with these surface fluxes for the duration of the reanalysis period.  Results are currently being analysed and compared with other ocean model results with the same forcing.  In addition comparison is being made with the observed variability in the equatorial Pacific and from satellite altimetry.  Comparison includes both the ocean response to higher frequency westerly wind burst and intraseasonal oscillations as well as the lower frequency El Nino response.
<P>
A notable landmark in the past year of involvement in the Universities Global Atmospheric Modelling Programme (UGAMP),   was the completion and first integration of a coupled General Circulation Model for climate and seasonal forecasting.  Current research is focused on improving understanding of: 1) The processes that determine the mean climate and seasonal cycle in the tropical coupled ocean-atmosphere system; 2) Intraseasonal variability in the tropical atmosphere and ocean, and its relevance to ENSO; 3) The influence of ocean-atmosphere interactions on climate variability over the North Atlantic and Western Europe.
<P>
Theoretical work on the predictability of non-linear dynamical systems has focused on the FASTEX (Fronts and Atlantic Storm Track Experiment) project.  This was initiated by the US government to obtain measurements over data-sparse areas of the Atlantic ocean in an effort to improve weather prediction skill.  Two aeroplanes have been dedicated for flights over the ocean to take measurements in areas where researchers feel they will be most useful.  Since the forecaster wishes to maximise the skill of a weather forecast, it is important to develop a system that results in measurements being taken in the most useful locations.  We use a simple system of ODEs to address this question in the low-order, nonlinear model scenario.  Trivial random and statistical assimilation schemes are employed and compared against dynamical methods such as breeding vectors and singular vectors for choosing the best place to assimilate.
<P>
The physical oceanography group has also been involved with the World Ocean Circulation Experiment.  Recent work has focused on the problem of interpreting oceanic measurements of transient tracers (CFCs and man-made tritium in particular) to improve knowledge of the interior ocean circulation. Using a boundary Green's function technique we can ask whether, or not, ocean tracer observations are consistent with general circulation model flow fields.  This reveals how the tracer measurements may be used to constrain the interior velocity field.  In order to actually perform this job of assimilating tracer data into an ocean model more sophisticated methods are needed.  We have been developing adjoint models which can solve these non-linear optimisation problems.
<P>
In a related project, chlorofluorocarbon (CFC) observations from the Southern Ocean are being analysed to improve the knowledge of the abyssal circulation in the region.  Dense outflows, carrying high CFC signals, can be traced over thousands of kilometres revealing the path of the abyssal water into the Indian ocean. Simple models have been constructed to constrain the speed and mixing of these deep ocean currents. 
<P>
Other work has involved investigating hydrodynamical instabilities common in the  upper ocean. A non-hydrostatic Navier Stokes model has been used to study gravitational, symmetric and baroclinic instability and the interaction of these processes in an ideal ocean mixed layer exposed to atmospheric cooling.  These mechanisms can be clearly understood by consideration of the Ertel Potential vorticity.  The project has also led to new parameterisations of convection and baroclinic eddy fluxes that can be incorporated in basin-scale ocean circulation models.
<P>
With the Space Science Department of the Rutherford Appleton Laboratory, scientific applications of sea surface temperature data from the Along Track Scanning Radiometer have involved a study of intraseasonal variability and instabilities in the tropical Pacific, a study of the impact of wind speed on sea surface emissivity and reflectivity, and a global comparison of ATSR data with operational analyses aimed at characterising deficiencies in the retrieval algorithms.  In a new joint project with the Southampton Oceanography Centre, processes at the ocean-atmosphere interface and in the near-surface ocean are being studied using the collocated sea-surface temperature (from ATSR) and sea-surface height (from radar altimetry) information from the ERS-1 and ERS-2 satellites.
<P>
A long-term objective of the ATSR sea-surface temperature monitoring programme is to quantify and reduce the uncertainties in predictions of anthropogenic climate change.  Although the satellite-derived data set is still too short for direct application to this task, we are working with the climate change modelling and detection group at the Hadley Centre for Climate Prediction and Research on the statistical techniques involved in climate change detection and their application to conventional data.  Our particular interest is in the use of model-derived statistics of climate variability, which is an essential step in quantifying uncertainty in climate change detection and prediction.  The application of standard and novel statistical techniques allows an objective comparison to be made between  modelled and observed variability, providing an essential consistency check in the climate change detection process.
