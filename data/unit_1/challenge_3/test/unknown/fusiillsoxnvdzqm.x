Abstract:
</H4>

<p>
The spectral theory of random matrices was originally introduced in
physics  as a statistical approach to the spectra of large nuclei.
 It found subsequent applications in such diverse domains as:
conduction in mesoscopic devices, quantum chaos, crystal growth, quantum
gravity in 2-D, and, most recently, supersymmetric gauge theory.
The deformation theory under changes in probability measure and its
relations
to the theory integrable systems, both classical and quantum, have also been
studied for a number of years. This talk will review the background and
point
out further applications to free boundary value problems governing the
interface between two fluids, and their relation to the dispersionless limit
of integrable hierarchies.
