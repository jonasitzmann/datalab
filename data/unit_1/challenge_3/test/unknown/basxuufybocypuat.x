<P><FONT COLOR=#000099>We regret that it is not possible to arrange
informal visits to the Department following our Open Day on 23
January.  All UK-based shortlisted applicants are invited for
interview and will have the opportunity to meet the relevant
supervisors then, as well as one or two of our current students.
Shortlisted candidates not based in the UK will be interviewed by
telephone.</FONT>

<P><FONT COLOR=#000099>Applicants should note that a first or upper-second
class degree (or equivalent) in Physics, Chemistry, Mathematics or
related subjects is required. UK-based students should have taken/be
taking a four-year course (M.Phys. or equivalent) rather than a
three-year course (B.Sc. or equivalent).</FONT>

<P><FONT COLOR=#000099><STRIKE>AOPP's Open Day on Tuesday, 23 January
is going ahead.  We still have a few places available so if you have
not already registered please email by Friday, 19 January if you wish
to come.  Remaining places will be allocated on a first-come
first-served basis.</STRIKE></FONT>

<P><FONT COLOR=#000099><STRIKE>We intend to hold an open day on Tuesday,
23 January 2007 if there is sufficient interest from prospective
applicants.  This will be an opportunity to meet supervisors offering
projects for 2007 as well as some of our postdocs and current graduate
students.  The day will start with a sandwich lunch at 1 p.m. to be
followed by brief talks/poster sessions/lab tours in the
afternoon.</STRIKE></FONT>

<P><FONT COLOR=#000099><STRIKE>If you would like to come please email
by 15 January to register.  We need a minimum of 10 attendees to go
ahead and the maximum we can cater for is 30.  Confirmation or
cancellation of the open day will appear on this website by 16
January.</STRIKE></FONT>

<p> The Atmospheric, Oceanic and Planetary Physics (AOPP)
sub-department offers a number of D.Phil. studentships every year for
students to take part it in the research work of the department. We do
not offer any Masters courses.

<P>The sub-department's research focuses on the study of physical
processes in the atmospheres and oceans of the Earth and other
planets, using experimental and theoretical techniques.  We have approximately
80 members, including nine permanent academic or research staff, about
34 post-doctoral researchers and senior visitors, and about 30
graduate students.

<P>On the experimental side we develop space instruments for infrared
remote sensing of the structure and composition of planetary
atmospheres, especially the Earth's stratosphere and mesosphere.  More
than ten of these instruments have been launched, either into Earth
orbit or to other planets; several new space experiments are under
development, including Earth-orbiting instruments to investigate
global change, and missions to Mercury, Venus and Mars.  Extensive
overseas and domestic collaborations are involved, with industrial and
scientific centres in Europe and the USA.

<P>We are an important centre for theoretical atmospheric and oceanic
modelling.  Our climate dynamics group studies the large-scale
behaviour of the atmosphere-ocean system and its response to external
drivers such as the increases in greenhouse gas levels responsible for
anthropogenic climate change. Other modelling of the Earth's
atmosphere focuses on large-scale dynamical and chemical-transport
processes relevant to climate, and on the interpretation of our
satellite data.  We also use dynamical models of other planets,
including Mars and Jupiter, to interpret existing data and help plan
new observational missions.

<P>We also investigate fundamental geophysical fluid dynamics by means
of laboratory experiments on rotating, stratified fluids.
