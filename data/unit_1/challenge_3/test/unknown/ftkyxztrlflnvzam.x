<h1>MACKINTOSH HERITAGE</h1><p>The history of the Glasgow School of Art is inextricably linked to Charles Rennie Mackintosh.  A graduate of the School, Mackintosh's 1896 design for a new School of Art building heralded the birth of a new style in 20th century European architecture and remains at the centre of the campus. </p><p>But Mackintosh was more than just an architect. He was also an outstanding international artist and designer.  Using the links on the left, find out more about our most famous gradaute, his masterwork building - the Mackintosh building and the School's extensive Mackintosh and other collections including the GSA Archive, documenting the history of the GSA and art, design and architecture education since 1845.    </p><p>The GSA welcomes visitors to the Mackintosh Building and to share, in the words of Professor Sir Christopher Frayling, Rector, Royal College of Art: "The only art school in the world where the building is worthy of the subject".  However, as it is still a working art school, the Mackintosh Building can only be visited by guided tour, given by GSA students.  </p><p>We look forward to welcoming you to The Glasgow School of Art.</p>
