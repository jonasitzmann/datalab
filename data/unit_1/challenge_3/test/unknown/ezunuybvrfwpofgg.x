<H2>Atmospheric, Oceanic and Planetary Physics Seminars</H2>
 
<P>
Except where stated, seminars are at 4.15 pm in the Dobson Lecture Room at
the Atmospheric Physics Laboratory and are preceded by tea at 3.45 in the
same room. Because on rare occasions the arrangements need to be changed, 
anyone intending to come to Oxford specially to attend should check first by
telephone (01865-272933). <BR>
