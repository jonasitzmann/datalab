		<p>The Glasgow School of Art enjoys a long and distinguished history of producing innovative, creative and successful artists, designers and architects and our distinctive, specialist, practice-based, education is today recognised worldwide.</p><p>Students are drawn to the GSA by the quality of our teaching and research, and the pivotal role the School plays in the creative community and industries of Glasgow, Scotland and beyond.  At the GSA you will study and collaborate with people from different cultures and disciplines, and after your first year you will have a dedicated personal studio space whether you choose fine art, design or architecture.</p><p>The School is renowned for the drive and standing of its academic staff, visiting lecturers and critics, who are not only inspiring teachers, but practising artists with international reputations in their fields.  Academic staff such as Professor Paul Anderson, Director of the Digital Design Studio, undertaking work with Ford (USA) and QinetiQ, Professor Thomas Joshua Cooper, internationally renowned fine art photographer, whose work was recently selected to hang in the new Scottish Parliament Building, Jack Cunningham, jeweller, who has recently curated an exhibition of contemporary narrative European jewellery involving over seventy key jewellers from twenty European countries and Sally Stewart, Architecture, working in the areas of accessible design and design for the elderly.</p><p>For many, the name of the GSA is synonymous with Charles Rennie Mackintosh, one of the most influential artist, designer, architects of the late 19th and early 20th century.  An alumnus of the School and architect of our main building, Mackintosh is one of a stream of intensely creative and innovative graduates, generations of successful and distinguished artists, designers and architects who have influenced and continue to influence world culture, creativity and design. </p><p>Today GSA graduates can be found worldwide, working for companies such as IBM, Apple, Dyson, Jaguar Cars, the Ford Motor Company, Foster Associates, Richard Rogers Architects, Nokia and Erricsson.  Others have joined the international design houses of Armani, Versace, Donna Karen and a large number are forging a name for themselves as today's creative industry entrepreneurs.  </p><p>Many choose to continue as practising artists, adding to the growing list of GSA alumni who are making a major contribution to the world of contemporary fine art, winning international acclaim. </p><p>Our graduates include the new Glasgow Boys and Girls of the 1980s - Peter Howson, Ken Currie, Steven Campbell, Adrian Wiszniewski, Alison Watt, short listed for the Jerwood Painting Prize, Christine Borland and Jim Lambie - Turner Prize nominees, Jenny Saville, Turner Prizewinners Douglas Gordon and Simon Starling and Beck's Futures Winners (2000, 2002, 2003) Roderick Buchanan, Toby Paterson and Rosalind Nashashibi.</p><p>The GSA's position as Scotland's leading art school is reflected in the success of our graduates internationally.  At the Venice Biennale 2005, the most prestigious international art event in the world, all the artists chosen to represent Scotland are graduates of the GSA - Cathy Wilkes, Joanne Tatham and Tom O'Sullivan, and Alex Pollard.  At the previous Biennale in 2003, 70% of the artists selected to represent Scotland were GSA alumni, including Claire Barclay, Simon Starling and Jim Lambie.  At the Milan International Design Fair in 2004, the world's leading design fair, 60% of the designers chosen to represent Scotland were GSA graduates including Timorous Beasties, 6am Hoover and Slight; and Charlie Sutherland and Charlie Hussey, GSA graduates and tutors in the Mackintosh School of Architecture, won the RIAS Best Building in Scotland Award in 2003 for their Ferry Shelter in Tiree.</p>
