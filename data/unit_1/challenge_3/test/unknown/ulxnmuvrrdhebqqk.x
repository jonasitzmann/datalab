<p><b><font size="4"><a name="mercury">MERCURY -</a><i> what kind of atmosphere does Mercury have, and could it support water?</i></b>

<p>Mercury has virtually no atmosphere at all. To an observer on Mercury, the sky would always be black, as the lack of atmosphere prevents light from being scattered.

<p><center><a href="mercuryglobe2.jpg"><img src="mercuryglobe2.gif"></a></center>
<center><i>This mosaic, also by the Mariner 10 spacecraft on the 29 March 1974, was taken while it retreated from the planet. Again consisting of 18 images, these images show somewhat more of the illuminated surface.</i></center>
 
<p>Because Mercury is so close to the sun, it was thought that the was no chance that water could exist at all. However, in 1991 scientists at Caltech boued radio waves off Mercury and found that there was an unusual bright return near the north pole. Because the rotation of Mercury is almost perpendicular to its orbital plane, the north pole always sees the sun at a very accute angle just above the horizon. Therefore any water that remained in craters or such could potentially be shielded from the sun and exist as ice in temperatures lower than -160 degrees C.



<p><b><font size="4"><a name="venus">VENUS -</a><i> why does Venus have a Super-Rotating Atmosphere?</i></b>

<p>Although Venus itself rotates very slowly (has a rotational period of 243 days), its equatorial clouds have a rotation period of 4 days (equivalent to wind speeds of 100m/s). Consequently the cloud tops are rotating faster than the surface of the planet, in the opposite direction to the sun. Almost, all of the sun's solar energy is absorbed in the clouds in a greenhouse-like effect due to the heavy concentration of CO<sub>2</sub> in the atmosphere. This energy provides the main driving force for the atmosphere's super-rotation.

<center><i>Ultraviolet image of Venus' clouds as seen by HST's Wide-Field/Planetary Camera 2.</i></center>

<p>As mentioned Venus has a heavy atmosphere of carbon dioxide with virtually no water vapour, and clouds which are composed of sulphuric acid droplets. This high conentration of CO<sub>2</sub> leads to extremely high temperatures (482 degrees C surface) from a very intense greenhouse effect.



<p><b><font size="4"><a name="earth">EARTH -</a><i> what makes Earth so special?</i></b>

<p>Earth's atmosphere composes of 78% nitrogen, 21% oxygen and 1% other constituents and shields us from nearly all of the harmful radiation coming from the sun. Our atmosphere also helps protect us from meteors, which burn-up from friction with the atmospheric gases/particles well before being in danger of hitting the surface. 

<p><center><a href="apollo17_earth.jpg"><img src="apollo17_earth.gif"></a></center>
<center><i>View of Africa and Saudi Arabia from Apollo 17. Probably the most requested picture of the Earth, this picture was taken by the Apollo 17 astronauts as they left earth orbit en route to the Moon. Taken on Dec. 7, 1972, it was the first time that the trajectory of an Apollo mission enabled a view of the south pole.</i></center> 

<p>The Earth's magnetic field also help shield us from such dangers. It arises from the planet's rapid rotation and molten nickel-iron core, and is distorted into a tear-drop shape by the solar wind.
Our upper atmosphere is a haven of activity - swelling by day, contracting by night, it is affected greatly by solar activity and is responsible for weather and climate on Earth.



<p><b><font size="4"><a name="mars">MARS -</a><i> is there water on Mars, and if so, why is it not frozen?</i></b>

<p>Mars's atmosphere contains mainly carbon dioxide, with small amounts of nirtogen, argon, oxygen and 0.03% water. Even though this level of water is very small, it is still sufficient to condense out to form clouds high up in the atmosphere, as well as thin layers of frost covering the ground in winter. But the question of large amounts of surface water is more taxing.

<p>Recent evidence from photograhs from the Mars Global Surveyor showed that there is a strong case for believing that water does indeed flow beneath the surface of Mars. Images of the far north and south showed what is believed to be groundwater occasionally bursting up from canyons or creator walls to carve channels before rapidly evaporating in the thin Martian air. It is thought that the liquid is water mixed with something else, which may or may not be more conducive to supporting life. The reason thought for this liquid remaining liquid under the surface and not evaporating away, is that it is flowing at such high pressures and in such large volumes that evaporation would be negligible. Also, high salt conectrations or high/low pHs would also reduce the freezing point sufficiently for it to remain liquid just beneath the surface.

<center><i>Global Map of Mars (Mollweide Projection).</i></center> 

<p>An alternative explanation is that the flows are due to 'clathrates'. These are explosive deposits of ice which are rich in CO<sub>2</sub>. If caused to expanded rapidly for some reason, the large amounts of CO<sub>2</sub> released would mimic liquid water and produce the same geological features seen.



<p><b><font size="4"><a name="jupiter">JUPITER - </a><i>why does it have a giant red spot and what is it?</i></b>

<p>Jupitor's giant red spot is an anti-cyclonic pressure storm, located in its South Tropical Zone. It measures 14 000km north-south, 40 000km east-west. The storm rotates anti-clockwise with a period of about 6 days and has its stability accredited to the fact that it never passes over any land mass. Material at the outer edge appears to rotate round in 4-6 days, whilst near the centre the movements are smaller and almost at random. It is thought to be formed by Jupitor's rotation combined with northerly and southerly layers of high-velocity turbulent winds, and is a demonstration of Jupitor's dynamic weather systems, where cloud pattens change within hours or days.

<p><b><font size="4"><a name="saturn">SATURN -</a><i> do any of Saturn's moons have an atmosphere?</i></b>

<p>The largest moon of Saturn is Titan, larger than Mercury and Pluto, the second largest in the solar system after Ganymede (moon of Jupitor). It has a planet-like atmosphere and thick clouds which have made it impenetrable to the prying eyes of Voyager, which could detect only slight colour and brightness variations. The air on Titan consists mainly of nitrogen and other hydrocarbon elements, which are responsible for it appearing orangey in colour. This atmosphere composition is very similar to the Earth's atmosphere, before life began to add oxygen.

<p><center><a href="titan.jpg"><img src="titan.gif"></a></center>
<center><i>Colour image of Saturn's largest satellite, Titan.</i></center> 

<p>Titan's surface air pressure is 60% greater than Earth's, with a surface temperature of -178 degrees C. Scientists believe the methane that exists there can be converted via photochemistry into ethane, acetylene, ethylene, and then with nitrogen to give hydrogen cyanide, which is an extremely important amino acid building block essential for life.



<p><b><font size="4"><a name="uranus">URANUS - </a><i>why does Uranus appear blue, and why does it rotate at an angle?</i></b>

<p>Uranus's atmosphere is composed of 83% hydrogen, 15% helium, 2% methane and small amounts of acetylene and other hydrocarbons. The methane present lies mostly in the upper atmosphere. This methane absorbs the red part of the spectrum from light shining on it, giving Uranus its blue-green colour.

<p><center><a href="uranus_true_and_false.jpg"><img src="uranus_true_and_false.gif"></a></center>
<center><i>True- and false-colour images of Uranus.</i></center>

<p>Uranus rotates around the sun tipped on its side, thought to be a result of a collision with a planet sized body early on in the history of the solar system. The most dramatic effect of this lop-sided roatation is on its magnetic field, being tilted at 60 dgreees from the planet's own axis of rotation. This effect produces a long 'magnetotail' twisted by the rotation of the planet into a long corksrew shape behind the planet. It is not known what the source of Uranus's magnetic field is (the source of the Earth's is from eletrical currents produced in its molten core) as the electrically conductive, super-pressurised ocean of water and ammonia, once thought to lie between the core and the atmosphere of Uranus, now appears to be non-existent. 



<p><b><font color="000080"><font size="4"><a name="neptune">NEPTUNE - </a><i>is it true that Neptune has ice-volcanoes?</i></b>

<p>One of Neptune's 6 moons, Triton, is the coldest place in the solar system, with a surface temperature of -235 degrees C. It's surface is frozen nitrogen ice and it is believed to have a very thin atmosphere with nitrogen ice-particles forming thin clouds a few kilometers above the surface. Even so, there exist erupting volcanoes which spurt out liquid nitrogen, the power for which is created by heat from slow radioactive decay of rocks beneath its surface.

<p><center><a href="triton_close.jpg"><img src="triton_close.gif"></a></center>

<p><b><font size="4"><a name="pluto">PLUTO - </a><i>does Pluto have an atmosphere?</i></b>

<p>The mean surface temperature of Pluto is below -220 degrees C, and so most materials would exist as solids or liquids, and those that would be gaseous could not be held by such a small gravitational field, and so would escape. However, the brightness of Pluto at infra-red wavelengths would suggest that there is some form of ice on the surface - thought to be most likely nitrogen and frozen methane, with traces of carbon monoxide. Also, it is thought that during 20 years of Pluto's orbit when it is closer to the sun and within the orbit of Neptune, these ices on its surface evaporate and form an atmosphere, only to condense back and form a frost when it moves further away from the sun.
