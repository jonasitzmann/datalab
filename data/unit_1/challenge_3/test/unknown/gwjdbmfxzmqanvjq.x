<p>This page offers a transcription of London, British Library,
Add. MS 12066, and a related letter from Add. MS 17520. The
former is edited in Butler's <em>Sidneiana</em>, but the latter
was not known to Butler. In presenting these documents we have
attempted to represent their original layout as faithfully as is
possible in html. Nevitt's text is carefully justified, with
frequent use of line-fillers. Numbers in the right-hand column
are given by Nevitt in the middle of the row after a bracket
encompassing the text to which they refer. We have put them at
the bottom of the row for the sake of clarity. Italics are used
to indicate Butler's use of an italic hand. Contractions are
expanded silently; Nevitt's consistent use of a majuscule for
initial 'c' has been ignored; we have tried to treat Nevitt's
terminal 'd' flourish consistently: at times it indicates an 'e',
at others it may be otiose, and at others still it is certainly
to be ignored. Erased material is given between angled brackets:
&lt;xxx&gt;. Where numbers have been altered the original reading
is given in whole for clarity's sake. Superlinear insertions are
given between carets: ^xxx^. Where punctuation is omitted through
Nevitt's oversight, it is supplied between square brackets: [)].</p>

commentary.</strong></p>

        of carseys perpetuanaes and fustians and many other
        commodities which I then delt in, and much more coulde I
        haue gott if the care of your honors affaires had not

        att London your honor and my Lady were pleased to ymploye
        ^me^ in your affaires and before that tyme I neuer
        entermedled with disbursing any of your honors monies.
        After th'ende of the yeare of the great sicknes your
        honor gaue me three watermens places to the late Queene
        which yeilded me 40<font size="2"><sup>li</sup></font>,
        which 40<font size="2"><sup>li</sup></font> I after gaue
        vnto your honor for a Lease in reuercion of some lande in
        Kent there being sixe yeares to come in the old Lease
        during all which tyme I had no benefitt of the 40<font
        size="2"><sup>li</sup></font>, att th'end of the sixe

        size="2"><sup>li</sup></font>. Also your honor gaue me
        viii<font size="2"><sup>d</sup></font> a day at Vlusshing
        theis thinges with now and then a sute of clothes were
        all I euer had from your honor for I neither had yearely
        wages nor board wages and althoughe I must acknowledge I
        gott other monies in your honors seruice, yett it came
        not out of your honors purse or you thereby damaged. as
        for example when a company fell att Vlusshing many tymes
        those that delt with your honor for them made vse of me
        to take vpp monies for them and to ingage my credditt
        with them for it and gaue me xx<font size="2"><sup>mks</sup></font>
        or xx<font size="2"><sup>li</sup></font> for my paines.
        and some smale matter I gott when thinges fell att courte

        meanes of the aduauncement of that smale estate I had
        ^For vppon the mariage of my wife I putt 400<font

        Knowles a Westcuntry Factor who had the ymployment of it
        Fower yeares and made it in that tyme as appeared by his

        cittie, after which tyme I purpose not to be heere in
        hast. I was within theis two daies with Mr Long, and hee
        tould mee that I did followe him over earnestlie in the
        busines, for if hee should but make an offer ^to have an
        order^ att this tyme I should never have a pennie,

        which I had found in the customehouse would bee otherwise
        disposed of, but hee tells mee that it cannot bee
        disposed of but according to his direccons. And nowe for
        the tallie and this warrant, they are but as thinges to
        shewe my Lord Treasurer what wrong hath binne offered to
        my Lord deceased; The warrant and Tallie are not worth

        will doe it. The creditors I dare assure your Honor will
        neither accept of Tallie nor warrant &lt;and&gt; this is
        one of the meanest reason of twentie that I will shewe
        vnto your Honor. Your Honor hath 250<font size="2"><sup>li</sup></font>

        not this without good advise and I had thought your Honor
        would have given mee manie thankes for my paines therein:
        for whether it take effect or not I have endeavoured what
        lies in mee to performe. The gentleman who is engaged for
        it makes noe doubt of it soe soone as any monies come in.
        Mr Addams hath binne very ymportunate aboute this monie,
        and Mr Geeres (who is one of the cheif of the parishe)
        marvailes it is not paid. I went to my Ladie and desired
        her to have some monie for the discharge of theis
        thinges, and shee tould mee that shee hoped that Your
        Honor would bee contented to allowe her these goodes for
        the 50<font size="2"><sup>li</sup></font> your Honor had
        of her when my Lord was sick, and shee did (as I finde by
        her) expect that you should have proffered it vnto her
        your self; trulie I never knewe of this. Her kinsman the
        Lawyer and Mr Austen with &lt;mee&gt; him and tould mee
        that Mr Ratcliffe hath a Iudgement against Emott for 100<font
        size="2"><sup>li</sup></font> and hee would have this 50<font
        size="2"><sup>li</sup></font> in parte of payment of the
        100<font size="2"><sup>li</sup></font> and this was all
        tould mee the verie same daie you came out of London, att
        which two assaultes I was much amazed; wherefore I did
        desire to have 33<font size="2"><sup>li</sup></font> of
        my Ladie for payment of theis thinges, because I would
        putt them both out of their bias [/bids?] for anie of
        that monie. I tould Mr Ratcliffe I marvaild hee would
        speake to mee aboute theis thinges considering I was but
        a servant. Out of the 33<font size="2"><sup>li</sup></font>
        I have paid the Plummer Mr Addams and the Surgeon 22<font
        size="2"><sup>li</sup></font> odd monie and have paid and
        reserved to my self iiii<font size="2"><sup>li</sup></font>
        ix<font size="2"><sup>s</sup></font> and i<font size="2"><sup>d</sup></font>
        which your Honor knowes of, and vi<font size="2"><sup>li</sup></font>
        I have reserved likewise vnto my self in parte of payment
        for my charges laid out in my being heere and for other
        charge laid out as by my bill maie appeare. For there is
        noe man to bee satisfyed sooner then ^nor before^ my
        self, and soe saith Mr Geeres for somebodie must followe
        the busines, and I knowe none to deserve paie better then
        hee which doth it. Mr Locherson makes a lamentable mone.
        If that Your Honor doth not appoint the interest monie to
        bee paid privatelie for the 100<font size="2"><sup>li</sup></font>
        and the 20<font size="2"><sup>li</sup></font> and
        likewise the interest monie to bee paid for the Agnett
        both Mr Lochersons bond and Mr Hawes will be putt in
        suite, Of which I thought good to enforme Your Honor. Mr
        Geeres charges aboute this busines I feare will come to
