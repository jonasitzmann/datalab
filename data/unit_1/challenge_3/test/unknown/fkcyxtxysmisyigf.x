<h2 align=center>RENAISSANCE MUSIC ON THE WEB</h2>

<p>

<a name=intro></a>

<h3 align=center>INTRODUCTION, GENERAL IDEAS</h3>

Because the World-Wide Web can offer sounds and images in support of text,

the next few years will probably see a proliferation of multi-media

extravaganzas. Expect Comus to leap off the screen at you in a year or two,

and eventually an animated Inigo Jones sketch to twirl before your eyes as

Michael Chance sings Ferrabosco's setting of a Jonson masque number. Already

record companies seem to have leapt on to the Web, so AltaVista searches on

names like Dowland and Marenzio will throw up dozens of blurbs for CDs.

Individual musicians have a strong web presence also, partly because many

musicians were seduced into computer literacy a long time ago by the

advantages of MIDI interfaces, enabling, for instance, musical notation to

be produced from a piano keyboard input, and multiple tracks/parts to be

played back. This does not concern us, but it is the sort of thing which

concerns a number of very good pages on the Web. Putting aside the

temptations of the Hurdy Gurdy Home Page, we can go straight to an example

of this, the extraordinary pages of the Finnish lutenist Arto Wickla at

<a href=http://www.cs.helsinki.fi/~wikla/music.html>http://www.cs.helsinki.fi/~wikla/music.html</a>.  This includes probably the best set of early music links, and plenty of

examples of pages with pretty tunes for those with sound cards.

<p>

The Cambridge Music Faculty recommends a start at one of two places: <a href=http://www.sun.rhbnc.ac.uk/Music/Links/>Royal

Holloway and Bedford (http://www.sun.rhbnc.ac.uk/Music/Links/)</a> and <a href=http://musdra.ucdavis.edu/Documents/AMS/musicology_www.html>

The American Musicological Society (http://musdra.ucdavis.edu/Documents/AMS/musicology_www.html)</a>.  

Royal Holloway's pages are a very rich though haphazard set of humanities

links with a musical skew; the AMS pages are rather less chaotic, and very

comprehensive.

<p>

Other fairly good links are at:

<a href=http://toltec.lib.utk.edu/~music/wwwclas.html>http://toltec.lib.utk.edu/~music/wwwclas.html</a><br>

<a href=http://www.iat.unc.edu/technology/music/music.html>http://www.iat.unc.edu/technology/music/music.html</a><br>

<a href=http://humanities.uchicago.edu/humanities/music/net.resources.html>http://humanities.uchicago.edu/humanities/music/net.resources.html</a>

<p>

The serious stuff, though (and please let us know if we're missing something

obvious), is limited...

<h3 align=center>DATABASES</h3>

<p>

<strong>RISM</strong><br>

The Repertoire International des Sources Musicales (International Inventory

of Musical Sources) represents a worldwide effort to identify and describe

sources of music and writings about music from the earliest times through

ca. 1825. The RISM Home Page is a joint production of the RISM

Zentralredaktion at Frankfurt/Main, Germany, and the U.S. RISM Office at

Harvard University Cambridge, Massachusetts, U.S.A. and is located at

<a href=http://www.rism.harvard.edu/RISM/>http://www.rism.harvard.edu/RISM/</a>.  

It hosts a number of databases, the directory to which is at

<a href=http://www.rism.harvard.edu/rism/DB.html>http://www.rism.harvard.edu/rism/DB.html</a>.  

Very useful and fully indexed is the database of music mss after 1600. Their

blurb: the RISM Series A/II Database contains bibliographic records for

music manuscripts written after ca. 1600 and, in most cases, before ca.

1850. Records include information in standard bibliographic categories as

well as graphical images of music incipits.

<p>

Others:<br>

The RISM-U.S. Libretto Database contains bibliographic records for more than

11,000 printed and manuscript libretti for musical stage pieces from the

earliest manifestations through the beginning of the twentieth century.

Presently included in the database are records for all libretti in the

Albert Schatz Collection at the Library of Congress.

The RISM Libraries Directory identifies more than 5,500 libraries world-wide

that hold music materials relevant to RISM series. All libraries are

identified by name and RISM siglum. Other information provided can include:

address, phone/fax numbers, links to relevant Internet resources, and

literature about the library.

The RISM Bibliographic Citations Database contains references for all

thematic catalogues and other secondary sources cited in the RISM A/II Music

Manuscripts Database and the RISM-US Libretto Database. The database can be

searched from hyperlinks in those databases, or directly from a database

search menu.

<p>

<strong>DOCTORAL DISSERTATIONS IN MUSICOLOGY ON-LINE</strong><br>

This is an excellent, and very comprehensive, searchable database, incorporating and continuing the American Musicological Society's published

listings: <a href=http://www.music.indiana.edu/ddm/>http://www.music.indiana.edu/ddm/</a>.  

<p>

<strong>UL MUSIC CATALOGUE</strong><br>

The new Cambridge University Library music catalogue contains ca. 12,000

entries for musical scores created since 1989, and includes nearly all music

manuscripts (except medieval liturgical and some other early mss). This is

its principal attraction. For instance, every one of the 239 intriguing

items in MS Dd.2.11 are separately entered, so the whole contents can be

browsed by a search on the classmark, and individual items can be pulled up

by their title. If you have a suspicion that there must be a number for

Willoughby, 'Willoughby's' in the title field will bring you 'My lord

Willougby's tune' from this ms. The catalogue can be browsed under 'other

catalogues' at <a href=telnet:ul.cam.ac.uk>ul.cam.ac.uk</a>.

<h3 align=center>OTHER COMPREHENSIVE SITES</h3>

<p>

<strong>SIXTEENTH-CENTURY PRINTED TABLATURES</strong><br>

This seems a very professional job. Its blurb: Sixteenth-century printed

tablatures for the lute, vihuela, guitar, and cittern is a site offering an

experimental database of printed tablatures for plucked-string instruments

from 1500-1599. It is primarily concerned with bibliographical information

relating to Lute, Vihuela, Guitar, and Cittern tablatures; it also contains

information on three lesser-known instruments: the Bandora, the Mandora, and

the Orpharion. Each section contains basic information regarding a specific

instrument: brief organological descriptions, explanations of tablature, and

links to more detailed bibliographical and biographical information. This is

an ongoing project; eventually, each book will be analysed as to contents

and individual incipits of the pieces (in tablature) will be placed in a

searchable thematic catalogue.  Visit this project at <a href=http://www.lib.duke.edu/music/lute/home.html>http://www.lib.duke.edu/music/lute/home.html</a>.

<p>

<strong>THE CLASSICAL MUSIC PAGES</strong><br>

This web site [tells you that it] provides you almost everything you need

concerning classical music - its history, biographical information about

composers (with portraits and short sound examples), explanations of the

various musical forms and a dictionary of musical terminologies.  Start at <a href=http://w3.rz-berlin.mpg.de/cmp/classmus.html>http://w3.rz-berlin.mpg.de/cmp/classmus.html</a>.   This is an ongoing project, but already it offers a fairly comprehensive set of extracts from the New Grove, with hypertextual links; certainly useful, if you really don't want to leave your desk.

<hr width=75% align=center>

<a name=lesscomp></a>

<h3 align=center>LESS COMPREHENSIVE BUT STILL WORTH A LOOK</h3>

<p>

<strong>THESAURUS MUSICARUM ITALICARUM (TMI)</strong><br>

TMI is run by the impressive Computer & Letteren at Utrecht University. The aim of the project is to publish in hypertextual format a series of 16th and early 17th-century Italian music treatises, although it is still incipient. A very full prospectus is at

<a href=http://candl.let.ruu.nl/>http://candl.let.ruu.nl/</a>. 

<p>

<strong>THESAURUS MUSICARUM LATINARUM</strong>

This is a repository of Latin music theory texts,

considerably more advanced: <a href=gopher://iubvm.ucs.indiana.edu/11/tml> gopher://iubvm.ucs.indiana.edu/11/tml</a>

<p>

<strong>LEXICON MUSICUM LATINUM</strong><br>

Prospectus for the printed volume, with

bibliography and links relating to Medieval music theory; a German site:

<a href=http://www.badw.de/musik/lml.htm> http://www.badw.de/musik/lml.htm</a>.

<p>

<strong>THEMA: (Music) THEory of the Middle Ages</strong><br>

At present, this database

comprises hypertext transcriptions of 18 manuscript copies of 14 Latin

theoretical treatises related to musica mensurabilis of the thirteenth

century. A little beyond our brief. <a href=http://www.uga.edu/~thema/> http://www.uga.edu/~thema/</a>.

<p>

<strong>GREG LINDAHL</strong><br>

Greg Lindahl has a personal but not unuseful set of pages, with an especial

liking for ballads and Thomas Ravenscroft; much is scanned in, so facsimiles

of entire volumes can be printed off.  For the main page, go to <a href=http://www.pbm.com/~lindahl/home.html>http://www.pbm.com/~lindahl/home.html</a>; for ballads, try <a href=http://www.pbm.com/~lindahl/ballads/ballads.html> http://www.pbm.com/~lindahl/ballads/ballads.html</a>. He provides an early music bibliography at <a href=http://www.pbm.com/~lindahl/articles/music_bibliography.html>http://www.pbm.com/~lindahl/articles/music_bibliography.html</a>.

<p>

<strong>JEFF LEE</strong><br>

Jeff Lee has a similar set of music pages, with MIDI files of Coprario's

'Funeral Teares' and links for lutenists: <a href=http://www.gate.net/~shipbrk/music.html>http://www.gate.net/~shipbrk/music.html</a>. His scary homepage includes a link to a fun set of 'rules for children to

write by' from 1611, with pictures of good and bad pen posture: <a href=http://www.gate.net/~shipbrk/>http://www.gate.net/~shipbrk/</a>.

<p>

<strong>LULLY WEB Project</strong><br>

The University of North Texas LULLY WEB Project, a multimedia thematic

catalogue of the University's Lully collections, is at: <a href=http://www.library.unt.edu/projects/lully/lullyhom.html>http://www.library.unt.edu/projects/lully/lullyhom.html</a>.

<p>

<strong>CARNEGIE MELLON</strong><br>

The trusty Carnegie Mellon English Server has some stuff: <a href=http://english-server.hss.cmu.edu/music/>http://english-server.hss.cmu.edu/music/</a>.

<p>

<strong>HNH</strong><br>

HNH, the umbrella company for NAXOS, provides composer's biographies with

surveys of their output, as well as a glossary of musical terms, with links

to information on Naxos recordings. Information depends on a record being

there to support it, so there is no Ferrabosco or Eccles; the glossary is

limited: no 'melisma', but 'modal' is useful enough. Not bad despite the

filthy mercantilism: <a href=http://www.hnh.com/hnh.htm>http://www.hnh.com/hnh.htm</a>.

<p>

<strong>TRANSCRIBING AND READING WHITE MENSURAL NOTATION</strong><br>

A labour of love from another muso punter, this site gives a multimedia tutorial in Renaissance music notation from the mid-16th century: <a href=http://listen.to/early.music>http://listen.to/early.music</a>.

<p>

<strong>THE ENGLISH DANCING MASTER</strong><br>

A project to enter Playford's first edition

(1651) is underway at: <a href=http://www.contrib.andrew.cmu.edu/org/sca/src/contributed/pc2d@andrew.cmu.edu/dance/playford.html>http://www.contrib.andrew.cmu.edu/org/sca/src/contributed/pc2d@andrew.cmu.edu/dance/playford.html</a>.  It includes audio and visual illustrations and is nearly finished. A parallel project by Jeff Lee seems further on: <a href=http://www.gate.net/~shipbrk/playford/index.html>http://www.gate.net/~shipbrk/playford/index.html</a>.

<p>

<strong>ENGLISH LUTE MANUSCRIPTS AND SCRIBES 1530-1630</strong><br>

One of the most impressive finds was the gobsmackingly vast 1994 Oxford

D.Phil. of Julia Craig-McFeely, ENGLISH LUTE MANUSCRIPTS AND SCRIBES

1530-1630, which one can download in its entirety, piece by piece, thanks to

the author's generosity. The files are under the aegis of a fellow lute

lover, who must have done the converting to html, no simple task:

<a href=http://www.cs.dartmouth.edu/~wbc/julia/>http://www.cs.dartmouth.edu/~wbc/julia/</a>.  It comes either in plain text or hypertext (with pictures). Try the

bibliography for starters, or the contents: <a href=http://www.cs.dartmouth.edu/~wbc/julia/toc.htm>http://www.cs.dartmouth.edu/~wbc/julia/toc.htm</a>.

<p>

<strong>THE PURCELL PROJECT</strong><br>

Pleasant audibles on offer at: <a href=http://web.ftech.net/~honeyg/purcell.htm> http://web.ftech.net/~honeyg/purcell.htm</a>.  Links to a basic multimedia biography and the BL's tercentenary Purcell exhibition (also multimedia) are at:

<a href=http://portico.bl.uk/exhibitions/purcell/overview.html>http://portico.bl.uk/exhibitions/purcell/overview.html</a>.

<p>

<strong>MORE MIDI TUNES</strong><br>

Including a fair few Campion, Dowland, Byrd: <a href=http://www.bcpl.lib.md.us/~cbladey/guy/html/midis.html> http://www.bcpl.lib.md.us/~cbladey/guy/html/midis.html</a>.

<p>

<strong>MEDIEVAL.ORG</strong><br>

Says little about itself but hosts a great deal of low-level

information, including Early Music frequently asked questions (FAQs), such

as 'what was the first opera?', the infinitely regressive equivalent of

'what was the first novel?'; the site also has links to huge amounts of

information on recordings, so a search on a composer will tend to take you

here: <a href=http://www.medieval.org/emfaq/>http://www.medieval.org/emfaq/</a>.

<p>

<strong>MUSICA BRITTANICA</strong><br>

This is usefully listed by its publishers at

<a href=http://www.stainer.co.uk/musica.htm> http://www.stainer.co.uk/musica.htm</a>.

<p>

For those interested in lyric poetry and song, there is no on-line Doughtie

or Fellowes, and the best thing in the meantime is to keep an eye on

VERSIFICATION, as mentioned below in 'Internet Resources': <a href=http://sizcol1.u-shizuoka-ken.ac.jp/versif/Versification.html> http://sizcol1.u-shizuoka-ken.ac.jp/versif/Versification.html</a>.

<h3 align=center>ON-LINE JOURNALS</h3>

<p>

Again, one can start at Royal Holloway and Bedford's list of music journals:

<a href=http://www.sun.rhbnc.ac.uk/Music/Links/journals.html> http://www.sun.rhbnc.ac.uk/Music/Links/journals.html</a>.  Or go direct to

<a href=http://www.sscm.harvard.edu/jscm/Welcome.html> http://www.sscm.harvard.edu/jscm/Welcome.html</a>

for the <a href=http://www.sscm.harvard.edu/jscm/Welcome.html>JOURNAL OF SEVENTEENTH-CENTURY MUSIC</a>. JSCM is published by the

Society for Seventeenth-Century Music and provides a refereed forum for

scholarly studies of the musical cultures of the seventeenth century. These

include historical and archival studies, performance practice, music theory,

aesthetics, dance and theatre. The JSCM also publishes critical reviews and

summary listings of recently published books, scores, recordings, and

electronic media. The journal is still working out its full potential, but

already has hypertextual links within articles to illustrative examples,

both graphical and audio. Clearly the on-line music journal is better placed

than many WWW efforts to assert its superiority over traditional media.

<p>

The other place to go is MUSIC THEORY On-Line at

<a href=http://boethius.music.ucsb.edu/mto/mtohome.html> http://boethius.music.ucsb.edu/mto/mtohome.html</a>.   This is the organ of the Society for Music Theory, and offers articles, reviews, book anouncements, dissertation listings, etc. with a theoretical skew but with no restrictions of period, so I learnt from here of a dissertation on the background to Morley's 'Plain and Easy Introduction', and a new book on German musica poetica.

<p>

<a href=#top><small>Back to top.</small></a>
<hr width=75% align=center>

<a name=lists></a>

<h3 align=center>LISTS</h3>

<p>

A good list of lists, including med-and-ren-music and rendance

(details for both of which are in the CERES Starter Guide) at

<a href=http://www.medieval.org/emfaq/misc/lists.html> http://www.medieval.org/emfaq/misc/lists.html</a>.

<p>

EARLYM-L is worth a look. It is a very lively list, accommodating

performers, listeners, musicologists, and is archived at

gopher://olymp.wu-wien.ac.at/11/.earlym-l.  Its home page is:

<a href=http://www.wu-wien.ac.at/earlym-l/> http://www.wu-wien.ac.at/earlym-l/</a>.  Rather clearer information on subscription is at

<a href=http://www.medieval.org/emfaq/misc/earlym-l.html> http://www.medieval.org/emfaq/misc/earlym-l.html</a>.

<p>
<hr width=75% align=center>

<a name=software></a>

<h3 align=center>SOFTWARE FOR MUSICAL NOTATION</h3>

By far the best notational software is that written by William Clocksin, of

the Cambridge Computer Laboratory and Trinity Hall, and a lutenist. His

'Calliope' is specifically geared to the problems of early music, including

lute tablature. Information about 'Calliope', and a demonstration, at

<a href=http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/users/wfc/calliope.html> http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/users/wfc/calliope.html</a>.  

Unfortunately the software runs only on NeXTStep, a UNIX platform which may

be made the basis for the next generation of Apple Macintosh, so perhaps one

day...

<p>

In the meantime there are some very expensive applications which enable you

to play with MIDI synthesisers, but very little devoted solely and sensibly

to inputting text and notes. Some lists of software are available at: <a href=http://www.sun.rhbnc.ac.uk/Music/Links/software.html> http://www.sun.rhbnc.ac.uk/Music/Links/software.html</a> and <a href=http://www.users.dircon.co.uk/~ara/notation.htm> http://www.users.dircon.co.uk/~ara/notation.htm</a>. Better, though, is the CTI's page: <a href=http://www.lancs.ac.uk/users/music/research/sware.html> http://www.lancs.ac.uk/users/music/research/sware.html</a>.  

This will take you to free software like Muzikator and Mozart; these tend

either to crash or not to cope well with combining words and music (or even

with managing 2 notes vertically on one stave in one case), as 'Calliope'

does so beautifully, and as other less elegant but very expensive

applications can. So as yet none receives a recommendation.

<strong>IHR</strong><br>

CERES strongly recommends the Institute of Historical Research's pages at

<a href=http://ihr.sas.ac.uk/ihr/ihr0101.html> http://ihr.sas.ac.uk/ihr/ihr0101.html</a>.  The IHR provides links to on-line resources for historians on separate pages for London, the U.K., Europe, and world-wide. So from the London list one can take a trip to the PRO via <a href=http://ihr.sas.ac.uk/ihr/source.lon.html> http://ihr.sas.ac.uk/ihr/source.lon.html</a> or <a href=http://www.pro.gov.uk> http://www.pro.gov.uk</a>.

The Historical Manuscripts Commission is also accessible at <a href=http://www.hmc.gov.uk/> http://www.hmc.gov.uk/</a>. 

<p>

<strong>THE NATIONAL REGISTER OF ARCHIVES AT HMC</strong><br>

The <a href=http://www.hmc.gov.uk/nra/nra.html>NRA (http://www.hmc.gov.uk/nra/nra.html)</a> is a computerised database of information on the nature and locations of manuscript sources for British history. The information is

taken from nearly 40,000 catalogues of manuscript collections as well as

published guides to collections and from the HMC's own correspondence with

owners and custodians of manuscripts. If you have a telnet program running

underneath your web browser, you can access the NRA directly from the web

page. Otherwise, telnet to public.hmc.gov.uk; log in as 'public'; easy

search methods include personal and family names, corporate names, place

names, and location of records.
