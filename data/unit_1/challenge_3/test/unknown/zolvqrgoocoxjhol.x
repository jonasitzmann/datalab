            <h1>Research at the University of Abertay Dundee</h1>
		    Research, both pure and applied, is an essential academic activity. The pursuit of knowledge is one of mankind's key distinguishing features, and the intelligent exploitation of that knowledge to create new ways of generating wealth and well-being for the community at large is the hallmark of a civilised human society.
            <br/><br/>
			The University of Abertay Dundee is fully committed to developing and promoting research activity, and we pursue this commitment with rigour and according to strict criteria. We focus on areas where research can be built on firm foundations of expertise and excellence. The activities described in this report have developed from the research interests of our staff.
            <br/><br/>
			At Abertay we strongly believe that research activity must, in the context of the emerging knowledge economy, focus on the needs and aspirations of industry and society at large. You will see many examples of research, which has as its primary objective the tackling of issues relevant to particular sectors, especially newly important components of the national economy such as digital entertainment, tourism, the human-machine interface and advanced manufacturing. Research work which focuses on the technological and graduate input needs of small and medium-sized enterprises - the backbone of the economy - is  promoted strongly..<br/>
            <br/>
			Our commitment and success are best exemplified by the <a href="Centres.cfm?Key=008.01">research centres</a> we have established over the last few years. Our Scottish Institute for Wood Technology (SIWT) is now recognised internationally for its work in wood preservation. Our Urban Water Technology Centre (UWTC) also enjoys an international reputation for the quality of its work on sustainable water and drainage systems in the world's cities.
            <br/>
            <br/>
			<br/>
			The latest additions to this growing research excellence are the International Centre for Computer Arts and Virtual Entertainment (IC CAVE) and the Scottish Informatics, Mathematics, Biology and Statistics Centre (SIMBIOS) - a joint venture with the University of Dundee which brings together the two institutions' complementary expertise in the new field of theoretical biomodelling and bioinformatics.
            <br/><br/>
			There is of course much more to Abertay research than these major centres. Within these pages you will read about many other smaller groups and individuals pursuing research in an extraordinarily diverse yet highly-focused range of disciplines. Institutional diversity and clarity of mission are two of the distinguishing characteristics of Abertay - factors which have been crucial in facilitating our emergence as a respected new University.
