<H2>Brief History of the Sub-department</H2>

<P>Atmospheric Physics started at Oxford shortly after World War 1 when
F.A.Lindemann was Dr Lee's Professor of Experimental Philosophy and
therefore Head of the Clarendon Laboratory. Lindemann was interested
in the upper atmosphere and was responsible for appointing a young
scientist then at Farnborough, G.M.B.Dobson, as a University
Lecturer. Together they worked on the analysis of observations of
meteor trails, from which they deduced that the temperature did not
decrease with altitude above the tropopause, as had previously been
supposed, but rather that there was a region where temperature
increased substantially with height. Dobson inferred correctly that
the cause of this was heating by ozone in the stratosphere, and he set
out to make measurements of the ozone amounts and their
variability. In 1923 he produced the first Dobson Ozone
Spectro-meter, to be succeeded in 1931 by his Spectrophotometer - a
device which is still in use worldwide, with a network of over 150
instruments making daily observations. (The famous `Antarctic Ozone
Hole' was discovered from data collected by one of these instruments.)
For many years, `Number One' was located in Dobson's original hut on
the roof of the Department. It is now in the Science Museum, South
Kensington.

<P>In 1929 Dobson became the first Reader in Meteorology, and in the same
year he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society. In 1948 he was
joined at Oxford by a new lecturer in Meteorology, A.W.~Brewer, and
together they made their classic study of atmospheric water
vapour. The `Brewer-Dobson Circulation' is generally accepted as the
breakthrough in understanding why the stratosphere is so remarkably
dry. Its details are still a major subject of study to this day in
Oxford and elsewhere.

<P>After Dobson retired, Brewer became Reader, and with one of his
research students, J.T.Houghton, made measurements of atmospheric
radiation and radiometric measurements of water vapour from aircraft
and balloons. Dr Houghton became Reader in 1963 and was appointed to
a personal Chair in 1973. He expanded the Department, adding two
further lecturerships, and in 1970 moved it from the Clarendon to the
`Old Zoology' Building. He also introduced it into the space era,
with a proposal for a radiometric temperature-sounder on the
NASA (See Appendix 1 for a list of abbreviations and acronyms)
satellite Nimbus D. This and subsequent Nimbus instruments flew in
1970, 1972, 1976 and 1978, and in the same period an instrument
(`VORTEX') was jointly developed with the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in
California. This became the first temperature sounder of the planet
Venus in December 1978.

<P>F.W.Taylor was Principal Investigator for VORTEX, having gone to JPL
in 1970 after completing a D.Phil.~in the Department on the
development of the Pressure Modulator Radiometer. Dr Taylor returned
as Acting Head of Department in 1979 when Professor Houghton went on
leave of absence to head the Appleton Laboratory (now merged with
Rutherford and Daresbury to form DRAL). This brought the Department a
substantial involvement in two more of NASA's large space projects -
the ATMOS spectrometer on the Space Shuttle and the Galileo mission to
Jupiter. A large and complicated space instrument, ISAMS, was accepted
for NASA's Upper Atmosphere Research Satellite. Three other major
space experiments with substantial Oxford involvement began in the
next few years: the ATSR, to measure sea-surface temperatures from
ERS-1, the EOR mesospheric water-vapour experiment on EURECA, and the
PMIRR atmospheric sounder for Mars Observer. The beginnings of the
Oceanography Group (originally under Dr D. L. T. Anderson) and the
Middle Atmosphere Dynamics Group (under Dr D. G. Andrews) also date
from about this time.

<P>In 1984, with Prof. (now Sir John) Houghton moving to the
Meteorological Office as Director-General, Dr Taylor became Reader and
Head of Department. A research team in planetary atmospheres was built
up and is now one of the leading European groups. In 1987, the
department was renamed and further expansion agreed.

<P>In August 1990, Atmospheric, Oceanic and Planetary Physics became
formally a sub-department of the newly-unified Physics Department and
Dr Taylor was appointed to the new Professorship of Atmospheric
Physics.

<P>Two new lecturers were appointed in 1991, bringing a significant
increase in the number of senior staff in the sub-department; another
lecturer was added in 1996.  The Nonlinear Systems Group, previously
in the Clarendon, also joined AOPP until its transfer to the
University of Manchester in 1996.

<P>Following ISAMS and ATSR in 1991, the EOR instrument was launched
in July 1992 and PMIRR in September 1992. The latter was lost, with
Mars Observer, a year later. It was rebuilt for the Mars Climate
Orbiter, launched in December 1998 and unfortunately lost again on
reaching Mars in September 1999! The CIRS instrument was built for the
Cassini mission to Saturn and Titan, which was launched successfully
in October 1997. HIRDLS, a follow-on to ISAMS, is currently being
constructed for launch in 2003.

<P>With the end of Prof Taylor's term of office as Head of the
Subdepartment in 2000, Dr David Andrews has taken over the headship.
