      <h3><a name="overview" id="overview">Overview</a></h3>
      <p>  The Cambridge English Faculty is a major centre for research in 19th- and 20th-century literature. Its staff include several leading figures in Victorian and 20th-century literary studies and it sustains a flourishing research culture. To continue to support research at the highest level, the Faculty has chosen not to offer an MPhil in this area. Instead, students wishing to work on literary, critical, and historical topics in this period will be admitted directly to the PhD. (Those with interests primarily in contemporary critical theory and post-colonial studies should apply to the Faculty's <a href="http://www.english.cam.ac.uk/postgraduate/Criticism_Culture_MPhil_Info.htm">MPhil in Criticism and Culture</a>, and those with interests in American or transatlantic literature should apply to the <a href="http://www.english.cam.ac.uk/postgraduate/AmLit_MPhil_Info.htm">MPhil in American Literature</a>.) We currently admit 10-12 new graduate students in this area each year. We welcome applications from able students who have completed or are completing Master's degrees elsewhere. </p>
      <h3><a name="programme" id="programme">Programme</a></h3>
      <p> Our programme of support is designed to enable Ph.D students (1) to acquire academic skills (2) to get to know a range of Faculty members other than their supervisors (3) to gain a wider sense of their individual subjects and of the relation of those subjects to other research in the period and (4) to develop a research community amongst themelves. As well as meeting regularly with their individual supervisors and with two Faculty-appointed advisers, graduate students working in this period are expected to attend the following: </p>
      <ol type="a">
        <li><span class="style2"><em> throughout the three years</em></span><br />
    Two fortnightly Graduate Seminars, one focussed on nineteenth-century subjects, the other on twentieth-century subjects. Each offers a varied programme of papers on research in progress from students and from distinguished visiting speakers. These seminars are intended to provide a forum for the kind of collaborative work which usefully supplements and diversifies concentration on the PhD thesis. The seminars meet in alternate weeks, and students working in any part of the period will benefit from attending both. <br />
        </li>
        <li><span class="style1"> in the first year</span><br />
    Issues annd Methods<br />
    A series of weekly seminars in the first two terms, designed to enable incoming Ph.D. students to get to know one another and one another's research subjects, and to help them to contextualize their work by providing a forum for informal discussion of texts and issues in the period, and of methods of research. Assistance will be given in preparing for the registration procedure at the end of the first year. A number of senior members of the Faculty working and publishing in this period will participate in these seminars and discuss the issues raised by their research. One main aim of this seminar is to assist graduate students in the period in laying the basis of a research community amongst themselves. The hope is that it will continue to evolve (as it has in past years) into a student-led reading group, meeting informally and continuing into the following term and beyond. <br />
        </li>
        <li><span class="style1">in the second and third years</span><br />
          The emphasis on developing academic skills and experience continues. Students in their second year will, if possible, be offered the opportunity of doing a small amount of undergraduate teaching on subjects related to their research; and also given the opportunity to gain lecturing experiencew. In addition, there will be communal sessions to discuss problems of completion and presentation, getting work published, and applying for jobs. For example, an academic journal editor will speak about the publication of articles and reviews, and a senior editor from Cambridge University Press about turning a Ph.D. into a book. There will also be a meeting with Dr Ruth Smith, the Careers Liaison Adviser for English students, to introduce the unparalleled resources the University of Cambridge Careers Service offers to graduate students, not merely whilst at Cambridge but throughout their future working lives. The University Careers Service has extensive experience of dealing with PhDs, both those considering pursuing an academic career, and those wishing to move on into other kinds of work. It offers (for example) detailed advice on research fellowship, postdoc and lectureship applications, on preparing different kinds of CVs and handling interviews; it provides information on employment opportunities, and maintains a large database of alumni contacts willing to offer help and advice. Students will find this Service invaluable not merely in planning their futures but in helping them to make the most of the time spent in working for the PhD. </li>
