<H1>Measurement of the Optical Properties of Volcanic Ash </H1> 
<P> 

Hello all, this is very much under construction!
</P>

We have just commenced a laboratory project, the "Optical Properties of
Volcanic Ash". This project will measure volcanic ash aerosol extinction
spectra and the aerosol particle size distribution. These measurements will
allow the calculation of the aerosol cross section. Dry, water ice and
sulphuric acid coated ash are to be measured. The temperature range will
represent that of the troposphere to the lower stratosphere. To facilitate
these measurements the project extends the capability of the Molecular
Spectroscopy Facility at the Rutherford Appleton laboratory. The project has
been funded by Natural Environment Research Council (NERC), under it's
Core-Strategic Measurements for Atmospheric Science (COSMAS) program.

</P>

For the time being this page contains the presentation material that was used
during the kick-off meeting on the project. This meeting took place on the 12
June 2003, at the Rutherford Appleton laboratory.

Don Graninger (the PI), gave an introduction to the project and some back
ground information. Can be found in power point format (<A

Sachchida Tripathi, gave an introduction to our current Microphysical model
for cell generation of aerosols. The slides can be found in pdf format can be
