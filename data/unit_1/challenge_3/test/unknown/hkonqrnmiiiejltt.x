          <td valign="top"> <p class="body-text">In the Middle Ages images were 
              the books - often called the 'quick' (i.e. living) books - of the 
              majority who could not read. Medieval art was a form of script, 
              and artistic endeavour across a range of media was unified by a 
              common purpose in expounding to the faithful the tenets of the Christian 
              faith, especially within the privileged spaces of the parish church.</p>
            <p class="body-text">In the church, on top of the 'rood' (cross) screen 
              between chancel and nave, would be carved figures of Christ on the 
              cross, the Virgin Mary and St John (i.e the crucifixion scene). 
              Above them, on the wall over the arch into the chancel there might 
              be a wall-painting of the Last Judgement, showing Christ presiding 
              over the general resurrection of the dead at the end of time and 
              their judgement to eternal reward in heaven or damnation in hell. 
              In the chancel there might be an altarpiece of painted wood or alabaster 
              panels depicting scenes from the lives of Christ and Mary. The undersides 
              of the wooden stalls used by clergy (misericords) might be carved 
              with devotional subjects (but often with grotesques and visual jokes), 
              and bench ends could have carvings of the seven deadly sins. On 
              the rood screen there would be paintings of saints, and the side 
              walls of the chuch might tell a story by means of wall-paintings 
              on scared subjects. Stained glass windows were also a script, displaying 
              Biblical stories or saints' lives. Others presented an integrated 
              scheme that related the life and ministry of Christ to those Old 
              Testament stories that were seen as 'antetypes' prefiguring events 
              in Christ's life. (This typological organization was popularized 
              by the early printed picture books, the <em>Biblia Pauperum</em>, 
              or 'Bibles of the Poor'). Roofs of great churches and cathedrals 
              (as at Norwich) might be decorated with carved stone bosses depicting 
              narrative cycles of New Testament incidents and their Old Testament 
              prefigurations. Many East Anglian churches had magnificent timber 
              roofs decorated with carvings of winged angels - an intimation of 
              heaven above - and the stone font, at which infants were baptised 
              into membership of the church, might be carved on seven sides with 
              representations of the seven sacraments. The effect of the whole 
              to a modern eye would seem an unfamiliarly polychrome profusion, 
              and also very cluttered, with side altars crowded with images and 
              objects of devotion.</p>
            <p class="body-text"> To sketch in this way the visual culture of 
              the medieval church is to realize the underlying unity of its concern 
              to tell a story, often through remarkable artistry and craftsmanship. 
              The later Middle Ages in England saw distinctive artistic achievement, 
              and this website assembles images from the many surviving aspects 
              of medieval English visual culture across a range of media, and 
              drawing on illuminated manuscripts to supplement what has been lost 
              in other forms.</p>
            <p class="body-text">This website has a double purpose:</p>
            <p class="body-text"> (1) It can help you to enter the visual world 
              that medieval English people would bring to encounters with texts 
              and especially as spectators at performances of the Mystery Plays. 
              It can help you to understand the inteface between image and text 
              for a medieval audience familiar with the conventions of representing 
              Biblical subjects and the patterns that interconnect and help interpret 
              those subjects. Many connections with the visual arts have been 
              made by critics attempting to show how the plays might have been 
              staged. Such connections can be illuminating but are rarely provable. 
              The greater value of images is in helping us understand what the 
              Mystery playwrights could take as read in their audience's knowledge 
              of the scenes they were dramatizing.</p>
            <p class="body-text"> (2) The site has been designed, in its selection 
              of images, to provide a library of materials for studying some of 
              the English arts in the later medieval period. There is an emphasis 
              on 14th- and 15th-century English material, but earlier images are 
              included for comparative purposes, as are some French and Flemish 
              items. For example, the site includes images from many of the most 
              significant illuminated manuscripts produced in East Anglia, and 
              representative selections from other manuscript traditions, stained 
              glass, and the English manufacture of alabasters and embroidery.</p>
            <p class="body-text"> The site is ongoing and images continue to be 
              added.</p></td>
