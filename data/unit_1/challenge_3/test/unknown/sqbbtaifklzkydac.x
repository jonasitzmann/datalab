<a name="intro"><h3>Introduction</h3></a>


<P>The department continued its long-standing programme to develop space
experiments to study the atmospheres of the Earth and the planets of the Solar
System.  Theoretical and modelling groups in the areas of middle atmosphere
dynamics, physical oceanography, nonlinear processes and geophysical and
planetary fluid dynamics continued their work on fundamental atmospheric
processes, supported in the last two cases by laboratory experiments.

<a name="space"><h3>Space Experiments</h3></a>


<P>A new focus on the physics of cometary comas led to a proposal to mount a
spectrometer on the recently-approved ROSETTA mission to comet Wirtanen.  This
experiment, to be developed jointly in Rome, Berlin, Paris and Oxford, combines
high spatial resolution spectral mapping aimed particularly at investigating
the composition of the solid nucleus and the ice and dust grains given off,
with high spectral resolution, capable of identifying the gases in the coma and
their physical state.  The requirement to cool the two focal planes to below
80K has led to a programme at Oxford to develop a new subminiature mechanical
cooler using pulse-tube technology.  If successful, this device will complement
the heavier and more powerful coolers which we developed ten years ago and
which are now being used extensively on scientific and commercial space
missions around the world through a licensing arrangement with British
industry.
<P>
Another development which reflects the current drift towards combining
commercial interests with scientific research - hopefully without compromising
either - is the Upper Air Sounder which the department has designed along with
a consortium of British and US aerospace companies.  This was in response to
interest by the US Air Force in the pressure modulation technique, pioneered at
Oxford in the 1960s and subsequently exploited on a range of atmospheric
science missions by ourselves and others, including NASA missions to Venus and
Mars.  A study has shown how the UAS, using modulators built in the department,
will be able to monitor atmospheric temperature from a series of operational
satellites over the next decade or so.  The prospect of five or six identical
instruments making measurements over a long period opens up new prospects for
the detection of early signs of global change.  Previous measurements and
theoretical studies have indicated that stratospheric cooling is one of the
most sensitive indicators of changes in the greenhouse effect.  Long term,
accurate monitoring by consistent techniques are expected to show not only the
temperature trends themselves but also any associated changes in the
stratospheric circulation and meteorology.
<P>
Another new development during the year has been the revival of the PMIRR
(Pressure Modulator Infra-Red Radiometer) experiment to investigate the
present-day climate of the planet Mars.  The original instrument was lost on
Mars Observer in 1993, but NASA has just agreed to fly a replacement on Mars
Surveyor which launches in 1998.  At Oxford, we have started work on the
detectors and optics and on fabricating new pressure modulators.  A proposal
for a similar experiment at Venus as part of the <i>Discovery</i> series of
missions was not successful, but is being revised for further consideration
next year.
<P>
A highlight of the past year was the delivery of the prototype hardware for
the Composite Infra-Red Spectrometer on the Cassini Saturn orbiter, which must
launch in 1997 to arrive at the ringed planet in 2003.  The CIRS investigation
is, for the Oxford investigators at least, focused mainly on the moon Titan,
which has a deep, cloudy atmosphere which resembles the primitive Earth's in
many ways.  A Titan model atmosphere is being developed to help plan the
investigation and, later, to analyse the data; this year, with the help of the
Physical Chemistry department, we have been including some sophisticated
hydrocarbon photochemistry with the aim of modelling the cloud production
processes and the vertical distributions of minor constituents.  Further
development of the Titan model will continue during the long cruise phase of
the Cassini mission.
<P>
Work has proceeded on the design of the High Resolution Dynamics Limb
Sounder (HIRDLS) instrument to be flown on NASA's Earth Observing System CHEM-1
satellite in 2002.  The project is joint with the National Center for
Atmospheric Research in Boulder, Colorado and several other institutions in the
UK and USA and now has more than 100 people actively involved.  HIRDLS is an
infra-red limb sounder that will measure temperature and the concentrations of
chemical species in the stratosphere, mesosphere and upper troposphere to a
high spatial resolution in order to study climate change and atmospheric
chemistry.  The project had a successful System Concept Review at Goddard Space
Flight Center in September 1995.  This marked the end of the conceptual design
phase, and detailed instrument design will begin in January 1996 with the start
of Phase C/D.  Software development and prototype electronic construction has
begun at Oxford, and the first engineering model hardware needs to be completed
by July 1997.
<P>
Work with the University of Toronto on developing the 'Measurements
of Pollution in the Troposphere' (MOPITT) instrument included this year the
delivery of the flight hardware designed and built at Oxford. Following
integration and test of the complete instrument in Canada, it will be launched
in 1998.  The goal is to map the distribution of carbon monoxide and methane
near the Earth's surface, and to investigate their global and seasonal cycles
of production and removal from the atmosphere.<i></i>
<P>
The Tropospheric Emission Spectrometer (TES) is a cooled Michelson
interferometer which will make highly detailed measurements of the composition
and temperature of the lower atmosphere.  In a collaboration with the Jet
Propulsion Laboratory, Oxford is designing the on-board radiometric and spatial
calibration targets.  The former in particular presents interesting challenges
for an instrument with much higher spectral resolution than a filter
radiometer, and will include a thermoelectric cooler to give a wide operating
temperature range and so permit on-orbit instrument linearity checks.
<P>
As lead co-investigator for TES measurements of emission from the
atmospheric limb, we are carrying out simulations and sensitivity studies of
the retrieval of atmospheric compositions and temperatures.  Detailed
intercomparisons of radiative transfer forward models have been performed with
other groups in the USA since such algorithms form an important part of the
retrieval process.  
<P>
Since 1981, Oxford has been part of an international team (also involving
the USA and France) which provided the Near Infrared Mapping Spectrometer
(NIMS) experiment for the Galileo Jupiter orbiter. The spacecraft will arrive
at Jupiter in 1995 December, and is in reasonable shape to meet its scientific
objectives despite much-publicised problems with the main antenna and the
on-board tape recorder.  Oxford responsibilities include key areas of the
atmospheric science, specifically atmospheric composition sounding and cloud
reflectance spectroscopy.  Until the first data arrives in the first half of
1996, development of retrieval software, including new laboratory measurements
of Jovian gases at high pressures and low temperatures, remains the main
activity.
<P>
Prototype hardware has been delivered for the Composite Infrared
Spectrometer to fly the Cassini mission to Saturn, which launches in 1997.  The
Oxford contribution to this US-French-British instrument is a new design of
cooler and the associated cryogenic system.  Testing of the prototype revealed
some deficiencies in the structure and thermal properties which are being
corrected in the flight model for delivery in the next few months.
<P>
A prototype of a new compact and robust solar spectrometer, capable of
surviving a semi-hard landing on the surface of Mars, is complete and now
undergoing tests.  A theoretical study has been undertaken which shows the
sensitivity of the device to water vapour, carbon monoxide, dust and ozone in
the Martian atmosphere. 

<a name="sat"><h3>Satellite Studies of the Middle Atmosphere</h3></a>


<P>A major achievement this year has been the preparation of a set of eight
papers describing the validation of the data from the Improved Stratospheric
And Mesospheric Sounder (ISAMS) on the Upper Atmosphere Research Satellite
(UARS).  They will appear in a special issue of <i>J. Geophys. Res.</i> devoted
to the validation of all of the UARS data.  In addition to temperature, the
validated data includes measurements of the concentrations of CO, H2O, N2O, O3,
NO2, CH4, N2O5, and aerosol extinction at 12.1 and 6.2 microns.  These
measurements are enabling a number of important studies of stratospheric and
mesospheric chemistry and dynamics to be performed by scientists
world-wide.
<P>
All ISAMS data have been reprocessed incorporating some improvements
identified during the validation exercise.  The new version includes the
retrieval of aerosol extinction at 7 new wavelengths and a first attempt at the
retrieval of nitric oxide profiles, a difficult problem due to the large
contribution to the infrared limb radiances from thermospheric NO.  The
preliminary results are encouraging: peak stratospheric NO is observed with
single point precisions of better than 20% on days when contributions from the
thermosphere are relatively small, and the expected diurnal behaviour of NO is
also seen in the data.  Work continues on developing source functions
appropriate to the thermosphere in particular, and in improving the stability
of the retrieval algorithms.  
<P>
The ISAMS observations of stratospheric nitrogen oxides are being employed
to investigate stratospheric chemistry, for example the diurnal variation of
the partitioning of NOy, including night-time decay of NO2 and production of
N2O5.  Studies are also underway to understand the discrepancies seen between
ISAMS N2O5 data and model predictions during the late afternoon when N2O5
values are low, and to investigate the departure from steady state of
intermediate species such as NO3.  A major effort is being directed towards
understanding the partitioning between the reservoir species N2O5 and HNO3 in
the polar winter middle stratosphere.  This partitioning is not in accord with
our present understanding of the chemistry, particularly in the polar vortices,
and we are examining reasons for the discrepancy with groups involved in
chemical modelling.  Possible candidates are missing processes, such as ion
cluster chemistry and heterogeneous processing on sulphate aerosols, in the
models.  
<P>
The data from the CLAES and ISAMS instruments are the first global infrared
measurements of the stratospheric aerosol and form a unique dataset.  The
eruption of Mt Pinatubo in 1991, one of the largest this century, injected 20
Mt of SO2 gas into the stratosphere, which  was converted to sub-micron sized
particles of sulphuric acid-water aerosol over a period of months.  Such a
large volcanic aerosol cloud produces local heating which perturbs the
stratospheric circulation, backscattering of solar radiation which affects
photolysis rates, and particle surfaces on which heterogeneous reactions take
place.  Modelling of these effects requires knowledge of the spatial and
temporal evolution of the microphysical properties of the aerosol cloud.  We
have used the constraints imposed by in situ balloon data to convert the
measured infrared extinctions into the aerosol microphysical properties of
volume density, surface area density and effective radius.  These have been
used to investigate tracer transport, heterogeneous chemistry and radiative
effects.
<P>
It has been shown that the liquid sulphuric acid component of the aerosol
is a more reliable tracer than the aerosol extinction.  Investigation of the
transport of the aerosols from the tropical stratospheric reservoir using this
tracer is in progress. ISAMS data of the Mt Pinatubo cloud was used to examine
the tropical stratospheric reservoir and the sensitivity of computed heating
rates to the presence of the aerosols.  A technique to interpolate UARS data
onto isentropic trajectories has been developed and is being used to
investigate the formation and composition of polar stratospheric clouds.
<P>
Departures from local thermodynamic equilibrium are important in the
analysis and interpretation of ISAMS data.  Projects being undertaken in
collaboration with colleagues at the Rutherford Appleton Laboratory and
Institute of Astrophysics in Granada include analysis of such effects on 6.9 um
emission from H2O and on the source function for NO in the stratosphere,
mesosphere and thermosphere, and a study of the effect on CO2 emissions at 4.6
um.  Improvements have also been made to the specification of the source
function and errors used in the CO retrievals and will lead to an improved
dataset for this molecule, an important dynamical and chemical tracer. 
<P>
Space-time analyses, which are sensitive to details of retrieval and
gridding processes not seen in zonal and time means, were used to investigate
the integrity of ISAMS retrieved temperatures.  Prominent zonal wave number 1
features are observed with characteristics similar to those expected for Kelvin
waves.  Time versus longitude plots reveal quasi-regular eastward phase
progression from November 1991 to mid-January 1992.  The perturbations extend
throughout the upper stratosphere and lower mesosphere (altitudes of 32-64 km),
exhibiting peak-to-peak amplitudes of up to 2-3 deg K and periods from 2 weeks
in mid-stratosphere to 1 week at higher altitudes.  Faster Kelvin waves (3-5
day periods) are also found in the lower mesosphere. Height versus time plots
reveal downward phase and upward group velocities, consistent with forcing from
below.  Vertical wavelengths are about 20 km for the slower mode and about
twice this for the faster 3-5 day mode.  The features are trapped within 10-15
deg of the equator.  Good agreement is found with the UARS Microwave Limb
Sounder (MLS) temperatures, illustrating the internal consistency and ability
of both ISAMS and MLS temperature grids to capture relatively small amplitude
features with space-time scales of fast, zonally asymmetric equatorial modes.
<P>
Two new research students have joined the ISAMS team. Jane Attwell is
working on heterogeneous chemistry in the stratosphere, using ISAMS data in
conjunction with constituent data from other UARS instruments to investigate
the influence of Polar Stratospheric Clouds on stratospheric chemical processes
by using measurements made on trajectories calculated to pass through the
clouds.  Katerina Koutoulaki is working on non-LTE effects on ozone in the
upper stratosphere and lower mesosphere.  Ozone is formed in a range of
vibrational states which do not correspond to the LTE distribution, leading to
an excess of daytime emission which is clearly seen in the ISAMS
measurements.
<P>
A new project has been started this year which uses data collected in since
1970 by a series of four Oxford-designed infrared radiometers on NASA Nimbus
spacecraft.  These produced a large database on stratospheric and mesospheric
temperatures, which is still widely used in dynamical modelling studies and in
formulating standard atmospheres for a variety of purposes. Advances in the
techniques and resources used to analyse satellite measurements mean that it is
now possible to obtain worthwhile improvements in the accuracy of the derived
temperatures by reprocessing the original calibrated data. This effort will
initially concentrate on retrieving temperatures in the mesosphere and upper
stratosphere from the Nimbus 6 PMR instrument, which was launched in
1976.
<P>
Water vapour measurements made from our occultation radiometer experiment
on the EURECA platform are being used to produce zonal monthly means of
temperature and water vapour in the dissociation zone in the upper atmosphere.
When the error analysis and comparisons with correlative data are completed it
will be possible to consider the processes responsible for the observed
seasonal variations.

<a name="gpfd"><h3>Geophysical and Planetary Fluid Dynamics</h3></a>


<P>The development and validation of a comprehensive semi-spectral general
circulation model of the Martian atmosphere, as part of a recently initiated
collaboration with the Laboratoire de M&eacute;t&eacute;orologie Dynamique
(LMD) in Paris, was completed during the year. Following this, a new and
definitive series of multi-annual climate simulations at high spatial
resolution under a variety of differing conditions (e.g. of dust loading) have
been completed.  Analyses of these simulations confirm our earlier findings
that the baroclinic weather disturbances which occur during northern hemisphere
winter act as a bimodal system, in which the atmosphere is found in one of at
least two distinct quasi-steady states, each characterised by a different zonal
wavenumber.  Irregular transitions between these states are stimulated by the
action of the thermal tide in the model, which results in an aperiodic response
which closely resembles the variability present in the time series from the
Viking Lander spacecraft.  This resemblance has been further studied using some
novel analysis methods, based on singular value decomposition of time series
from nonlinear dynamical systems, originally developed for our laboratory
work.
<P>
Further analyses of our climate simulations have confirmed the presence of
concentrated low-level equator-crossing jets adjacent to large topographic
features on Mars, previously identified in our earlier studies using much
simpler atmospheric models as analogues of oceanic `western boundary currents'.
In the full GCM simulations, however, the jets are found to be strongly
modulated by the diurnal cycle, resulting in additional wind components due to
katabatic slope winds.  The thermal tide has also been found to produce a
low-level westerly jet close to the equator, particularly around the equinoxes
in the seasonal cycle when the dust loading is high.  This jet is evidently
present in simulations obtained by other models of the Martian atmosphere, but
there is as yet no direct observational evidence to confirm this
phenomenon.
<P>
The collaborative work on the development of a new Mars model has recently
received recognition in the award by ESA of a research contract to ourselves
and LMD to further develop jointly a more advanced version of our model, and to
carry out a series of very high resolution simulations of the Martian climate.
These simulations will be used as the basis for a new database which will
provide information useful to spacecraft engineers planning future missions to
Mars, including the proposed INTERMARSNET project.
<P>
Our data assimilation work has also made good progress.  The Analysis
Correction scheme, as used routinely by the Meteorological Office for
initialisation of their numerical weather prediction model, has been
implemented for all versions of our Mars models, including the full GCM
discussed above.  A range of experiments have been carried out to evaluate the
feasibility of using such methods to analyse observations from past and future
spacecraft missions to Mars.  Experiments take simulated data from our full
climate simulations in the form which might be acquired by either a polar
orbiting spacecraft (such as the forthcoming NASA Global Surveyor series)
and/or from networks of surface stations or landers are passed to the analysis
scheme and the accuracy of the reconstructed fields of meteorological variables
are compared with the original GCM simulations.  The results confirm the
feasibility of obtaining successful analyses of the synoptic variability of the
Mars atmosphere using temperature measurements from orbiting spacecraft such as
the Global Surveyor series.  Experiments suggest that significant improvements
to the analyses may be obtainable if additional information on the variation of
surface pressure can be obtained at the same time as the orbiter measurements,
e.g. from a small network of surface stations such as planned for
INTERMARSNET.
<P>
The other main element of the group's research programme is concerned with
laboratory studies of waves and instabilities in rotating, stratified flows;
phenomena which underlie a range of processes which are important in
determining the energetics, transport and predictability of virtually all
oceans and atmospheres.  A major programme of measurements to investigate
transition phenomena and the occurrence of complex mixed-mode baroclinic wave
flows was completed.  A range of irregular, intermittent oscillations were
found to occur as the result of a complex nonlinear competition between
distinct spatial modes in the flow.  Nonlinear interactions via either
wave-mean flow coupling, or various kinds of wave-wave interaction, were found
to contribute to the observed variability in differing regions of parameter
space.  The mechanisms identified were capable of producing variability on very
long timescales, and may well turn out to be relevant to understanding the very
long timescale variability recently discovered in very long integrations of
atmospheric climate models as part of the UK Universities Global Atmospheric
Modelling Programme (UGAMP).
<P>
The availability of high quality data from these experiments has recently
led to a new collaboration with colleagues in the Mathematical Institute on the
general theme of evaluating the predictability of nonlinear systems.  Work is
now under way, for example, to apply forms of Singular Value Decomposition
methods to the analysis of the spatio-temporal behaviour of some of the complex
multi-mode flows discussed above.  Such methods are useful not only as a means
of representing the evolution of a complex nonlinear system in a highly
efficient way, but also as an aid in the formulation of simple nonlinear models
of the phenomena observed in the laboratory.
<P>
In a related programme, Dr L. Smith (Mathematical Institute) has developed
a general nonlinear prediction algorithm (based around radial basis function
interpolation) which he has applied to time series of temperature measurements
from our laboratory system, typically in a complex multi-mode regime.  Large
ensembles of ~ 2048 initial states are presented to the predictor, which then
forecasts the evolution of a `probability density function' at future times, in
a similar manner to that used increasingly in the evaluation of numerical
weather forecasts, though with many fewer members in an ensemble (typically
around 32).  Forecast experiments using our laboratory data have exhibited a
number of intriguing phenomena, previously only observed in experiments with
idealised data derived from numerical models, such as the initial growth of
errors followed by their subsequent contraction in a recovery of predictive
skill at later times.  Future developments of this work will investigate novel
methods (a) of evaluating forecast skill and (b) for the optimal selection of
ensembles for prediction systems. 

<a name="atmos"><h3>Middle Atmosphere Dynamics</h3></a>


<P>The Middle Atmosphere modelling group uses a variety of numerical models
to investigate dynamical and physical processes in the stratosphere and
mesosphere and to interpret satellite data. 
<P>
As part of our contribution to the Universities' Global Atmospheric
Modelling Programme, we have been collaborating in some multi-year simulations
using a sophisticated model of the atmosphere from the ground to approximately
90 km altitude. Particular attention has been focused on seasonal evolution and
variability in the model. The simulations use a modified version of a standard
scheme for parameterizing the effects of breaking internal gravity waves in the
model. (These effects are poorly understood, but are believed to play a crucial
role in the circulation of the mesosphere.) Results show that the model
captures many features of the observed climatology of the middle atmosphere
reasonably well. However there are some clear problems, particularly in early
winter in both hemispheres, and in late winter in the southern hemisphere. The
results are sensitive to the gravity-wave parameterization but, surprisingly,
rather insensitive to an increase in the model's horizontal resolution. 
<P>
Simulations of early winter 1991/92 have been performed using the UK
Meteorological Office's Stratosphere-Mesosphere Model.  This is the period that
we had previously studied intensively using ISAMS data.  The model simulations
have revealed that the location and alignment of the polar westerly vortex are
particularly important in the development of the observed near-major sudden
warming in mid-January. In addition, it appears that inertial instability of
tropical regions may influence the higher latitude evolution by moderating the
usual cross-equatorial summer-to-winter circulation in the upper stratosphere.
<P>
We have also been using the Stratosphere-Mesosphere Model to investigate
equatorially-trapped waves, with the intention of simulating the observed
Quasi-Biennial Oscillation - an oscillation of winds and temperatures in the
equatorial stratosphere with a period of roughly 27 months. The QBO is thought
to be forced by rectified effects due to short-period, upward-propagating
Kelvin and Rossby-gravity waves. To date, a Kelvin wave has been introduced
into the model and the resultant westerly accelerations in the mean flow
investigated. A start has been made on the modelling of the Rossby-gravity wave
thought to be responsible for the easterly phase of the QBO. 
<P>
We have recently started using a high-resolution chemical-transport model
kindly provided by the Department of Chemistry at Cambridge, with a view to
interpreting ISAMS sulphuric acid data.  The sulphuric acid is associated with
aerosol ejected by Mt Pinatubo, and is thought to be a more conservative tracer
than aerosol itself.  Validation runs in the absence of diabatic heating show
very good agreement between this model and independent runs using an isentropic
'contour advection' scheme.  Initial runs with the model, using ISAMS sulphuric
acid data and including diabatic heating, have highlighted mechanisms
responsible for the transport of air from the tropics to midlatitudes in the
lower stratosphere. 
<P>
We are investigating whether stratospheric tracer information (e.g. N2O
from ISAMS) can be used, in a comparatively simple way, to improve
satellite-based estimates of stratospheric winds, especially in low latitudes.
Associated work is to study dynamically-interesting features in the ISAMS
low-latitude stratospheric N2O fields and to carry out contour advection
simulations of such features. 
<P>
The ISAMS team has recently been analysing tidal data for the stratosphere
and mesosphere. To interpret these observational studies some tidal modelling,
based on a model we developed a few years ago, has recently begun. Basic
features like the trapped diurnal tidal structure around the midlatitude
stratopause, forced by ozone heating, are well modelled; however, further work
will need to be done to understand less prominent aspects of the observations.

The main focus of this research continues to be on the application of
modern mathematical ideas of bifurcation and dynamical systems theory to fluid
flows.  There are currently three major projects underway concerned with
hydrodynamic phenomena in crystal growing processes, nematic liquid crystal
flows and the effects of symmetries on rotating flows.  The work is underpinned
using contemporary signal processing techniques to enable a connection between
experiment and theory to be made. In addition, important insights are gained
into nonlinear processes in systems governed by partial differential equations
by investigating much simpler problems such as coupled pendulums.
<P>
The crystal growth project is concerned with the convective flows induced
by the temperature gradient between crystalline gallium and the melt.  These
arise in practice when a crystal is slowly pulled from the melt.  Oscillations
can develop in the flow which in turn produce unwanted striations in the
crystal.  A magnetic field applied at right angles to this liquid metal flow
can suppress the oscillations under certain conditions but is can also enhance
them and produce low-dimensional chaos.  Thus there is a need for a greater
understanding of the fundamental fluid dynamics.  Our initial work was
concerned with the steady convective flows where we have now obtained highly
satisfactory agreement between experiment, theory and complimentary numerical
work.  However, when the temperature gradient is increased so that oscillations
appear, qualitative differences between experiment and calculation are found.
In essence, the experimental study has uncovered a rich variety of dynamical
phenomena which indicates that crucial elements are missing from the
theoretical model.
<P>
Electrohydrodynamic convection in nematic liquid crystal flows occurs when
an ac field is applied across a device and the frequency and voltage are set
above some critical values.  It is avoided in most commercial devices such as
computer screens by designing the product in such a way that the phenomenon is
suppressed.  However, this may be very inefficient and one way of making
progress is to gain a deeper understanding of the processes involved.  Thus we
have developed a very small liquid crystal device which is approximately the
same size as the dot on this "i".  This enables us to have very tight control
on the convection patterns which arise and further we plan to obtain numerical
solutions of the complicated governing equations of motion so that an absolute
comparison between theory and experiment can be made.  The experiments have
also revealed low-dimensional dynamical motion including chaos.  This is
particularly exciting since the flow is on the limits of the continuum
approximation used in hydrodynamics so that there is an interplay between
microscopic and macroscopic effects.
<P>
The flow between rotating cylinders, commonly called Taylor-Couette flow
has provided an excellent test bed for ideas from dynamical systems theory.  It
could be argued however, that the rather special geometry of one cylinder
rotating inside another may mean that the observed behaviour is untypical of
broader classes of fluid flows.  In addition, any wave which is generated will
be fed back onto itself creating resonance phenomena.  We have carried out a
systematic study of the first of these features in the past by reducing the
symmetry of the problem in definite stages.  Now we have a constructed a
geometry where the closed flow aspect can be investigated in detail.  The
apparatus consists of two half cylinder ends with two straight sections in
between so that it resembles a stadium shape if viewed from above.  There are
two such configurations with one inside the other so that there is a uniform
gap around the stadium.  The flow is unstable in the curved sections and stable
in the straights so that disturbances can grow and decay as they are convected
around the gap.  Preliminary experimental results are encouraging in that both
low and high-dimensional dynamics are found.
<P>
Open flow problems where instabilities may grow or diminish as they are
convected along are the norm.  A classic example of this is to be found in the
Reynolds experiment concerned with transition to turbulence in a long straight
pipe.  We have carried out a carefully controlled experimental study of this
problem by driving the flow at constant mass flux and hence constant Reynolds
number.  Our results are in good accord with theory which predicts that the
flow is linearly stable so that a finite amplitude perturbation has to be added
to trigger turbulence.  More interestingly the transition appears to be
independent of the form of the perturbation added.  This gives an indication
that the process may involve `disconnected' solutions which are found in other
problems.  Another open flow we have investigated is flow through a sudden
expansion. In this case the natural transition process involves complicated
dynamical events.  However, we have shown that if a periodic perturbation is
added to the flow then low-dimensional dynamics appear which have the same form
as those found in the Taylor-Couette system.  Interestingly, the
low-dimensional dynamics can replace the more complicated dynamics found in the
unforced system.

<P>Work has continued on the development of models of intermediate complexity
applied to the seasonal prediction problem.  The model shows a reduction in
predictive skill in spring, sometimes called the predictability barrier.  Our
model shows such a `barrier' in the decade of the 70s, but not in the decade of
the 80s. There is not sufficient data to allow predictions for periods earlier
than the 70s, but a proxy analysis using observed sea surface temperature and
persistence as a measure of predictive skill has been made back to the end of
the last century.  The dependence of predictive skill on the seasonal cycle and
on the phase of ENSO has been investigated theoretically using the delay
oscillator equation.  The mechanism of obtaining the ocean initial state in any
prediction experiment is to precondition the ocean using the past history of
the wind field.  This procedure might be less than optimal as noise undoubtedly
is present in the wind and this might misalign the initial model trajectory.
To try to improve the ocean state a relation between observed wind and observed
sea surface temperature was found statistically and used to filter the observed
winds.  This, combined with changes in the coupling coefficient has lead to
improved multi-seasonal predictions, as validated over the 70s and 80s.  To
investigate further the sensitivity of the coupled model to initial conditions,
the adjoint of the model is under construction.
<P>
To investigate low frequency variability in the coupled system, a new
atmospheric model is being constructed and coupled to a full general
circulation ocean model.  This will make possible highly detailed study of the
role of ocean-atmosphere interactions in the climate system.  Of particular
interest is improving understanding of the extent to which climate variability
is predictable on seasonal and longer timescales. The project is highly
collaborative, involving partnerships with the Centre for Global Atmospheric
Modelling at Reading University, the European Centre for Medium Range Weather
Forecasting (ECMWF), the UK Meteorological Office and the NERC OCCAM
ocean-modelling project.  In the first year, a flexible system for running
coupled models has been put together based on a universal coupling interface
developed at CERFACS in Toulouse, which permits a wide range of coupled models,
of varying complexity, to be configured around a single unifying framework.
The current version of the coupled model consists of the ECMWF `IFS'
atmospheric GCM, coupled to the OCCAM `MOMA' ocean GCM.  
<P>
The development phase for the coupled GCM is virtually finished.  In the
next year, versions of the model will be used to address a range of key issues
such as: the role of ocean-atmosphere interactions in determining the mean
climate state and climate variability on timescales from intraseasonal to
decadal;  the nature of the relationships between patterns of climate
variability characterised by different timescales and found in different
regions.  Progress in addressing these issues will be fundamental to future
advances in seasonal and longer term forecasting of the climate system.
