<h1 align=center>Unified Model Page</h1>

<p>
This page describes experiments I have performed under a project funded by the NERC UTLS Ozone programme entitled <b>Dynamics and variability in the UTLS region in the coupled ocean-atmosphere system</b> in collaboration with Myles Allen and Mike Palmer (AOPP, Oxford), Keith Williams, Ruth McDonald and Cath Senior (Met Office), and Mark Baldwin (NWRA, Seattle).

<h2 align=center>64-level slab model</h2>
<p>
In the course of this project a 64-level slab model was developed, based on the atmosphere-only model written by Jeff Cole, but coupled to a slab ocean. The model has been used to examine the role of stratospheric resolution in determining the response to greenhouse gas and ozone forcing, so it was important to make the model in other respects as similar as possible to HadSM3, a 19-level model, which was to be used as a control. The following links give details of the particular changes to make the L64SM from either the L64 atmosphere only model, or from HadSM3.

<h2 align=center>EP flux modset</h2>
<p>
This modset changes the calculation of UV, VT, V^2, and U^2, T^2, wU, wT under STASH, such that it outputs U'V', V'T', V'^2, U'^2, T'^2, w'U', and w'T' where ' indicates an anomaly from the zonal mean. This allows EP and Plum fluxes to be calculated from the output.
