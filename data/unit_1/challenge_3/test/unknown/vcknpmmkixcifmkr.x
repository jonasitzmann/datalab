<H3>The Society's Library</H3>
<P align=justify>
In 1993 the RSGS moved its Headquarters from Edinburgh to new office accommodation in the <a href="http://www.strath.ac.uk/maps/graham_hills.htm">Graham Hills Building</a> on the University of Strathclyde's John Anderson Campus in the centre of Glasgow. &nbsp; Following its relocation to Glasgow, the Society deposited its Library in a new dedicated reading room and repository at the University of Strathclyde's <a href="http://www.lib.strath.ac.uk/">Andersonian Library</a> in the <a href="http://www.strath.ac.uk/maps/curran.htm">Curran Building</a>, 101 St James' Road, Glasgow. &nbsp; Officially opened by HRH The Princess Royal on 20th April 1994 and named <a href="http://www.lib.strath.ac.uk/RSGS.htm">The Royal Scottish Geographical Library of the University of Strathclyde</a>, the Collection was purposely located in close proximity to the University Library's own collections of geographical books, journals and maps on the Arts and Humanities floor (5).
</P>
<P align=justify>
Accommodation for the RSGS library includes 16 study places in addition to consultation tables for the perusal of larger volumes. &nbsp; A microcomputer workstation located in the reading room provides access to the Andersonian Library's <a href="http://zen.lib.strath.ac.uk/">on-line catalogue</a>, and thus to the bibliographic records of the entire holdings of the <a href="http://www.lib.strath.ac.uk/">University of Strathclyde Library</a> system.
</P>
<br>
<H3>The Collection</H3>
<P align=justify>
This long-established library comprises over 15,000 books and nearly 200 serial titles currently received on a regular basis by the Society.
</P>
<P align=justify>
Of particular significance in this collection are a set of Hakluyt publications, sizeable collections of travel guides, geographical journals, monographs on geography, local history and topography, and works on polar exploration and mountaineering. &nbsp; In 1998 the gift of some 2,000 books by Professor J.T. Coppock was a major addition to the Library.
</P>
<P align=justify>
The Library is augmented on a continuing basis by additions of books, reports and serial issues supplied through the RSGS.
</P>
<P align=justify>
In addition to the book and periodical collection housed in the <a href="http://www.lib.strath.ac.uk/">University of Strathclyde Library</a>, the RSGS has additional collections of maps, photographs, archives and reference material at its Headquarters. &nbsp; Enquiries about these collections should be addressed to the Society's staff on floor 5 of the <a href="http://www.strath.ac.uk/maps/graham_hills.htm"> Graham Hills Building</a>.
</P>
<BR>
<H3>Access to the Collection</H3>
<P align=justify>
Access to the RSGS Library is available freely to members of the Society as well as to the University of Strathclyde's own staff and students during the normal opening hours of the University Library. &nbsp; Other bona fide scholars who wish to use the RSGS Library should apply in writing to the <a href="http://www.lib.strath.ac.uk/main_staff_dir.htm">University Librarian</a> at the <a href="http://www.strath.ac.uk/">University of Strathclyde</a>.
</P>
<P align=justify>
Readers can be assisted by the staff of the University Library at the main enquiry desk on level 3, where an extensive range of information sources is available.
</P>
<BR>
<H3>University of Strathclyde Library - On Line Catalogue</H3>
<P align=justify>
The books and periodicals in the RSGS Library have been catalogued according to international MARC (Machine Readable Cataloguing) standards, classified, and incorporated in the Andersonian Library's <a href="http://zen.lib.strath.ac.uk/">On-line Public Access Catalogue</a> (OPAC), which contains entries for all the books and serial titles held in the Library. &nbsp; Access to information on the RSGS Library is therefore readily available nationally and internationally through the Joint Academic Network (JANET) and the Internet.
