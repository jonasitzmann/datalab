<p>
This talk will discuss theories for the decay in time of an advected
passive scalar in a large-scale flow, e.g. a chaotic advection flow. This
problem is relevant to atmospheric, oceanic and mantle flows.

Recent theories -- `Lagrangian stretching theories' -- have predicted the
evolution of the scalar field by considering the evolution within a small
fluid element and then averaging over many such elements. The statistical
properties of the decaying scalar field are then determined by the
statistics of Lagrangian stretching histories. Agreement has been claimed
with numerical and laboratory experiments.

I will argue that the Lagrangian stretching theories do not give useful
information for the scalar decay problem. For example, the decay rate of
different moments of the scalar field is incorrectly predicted. Correct
description of the decay requires solution of a `global' eigenvalue
problem, in which the scalar field within different fluid elements cannot
be considered as independent. However, once the decay rate of, say, the
variance has been determined, then information on the statistics of
Lagrangian stretching may be used to predict the wavenumber spectrum or
probability density function of the scalar concentration.
