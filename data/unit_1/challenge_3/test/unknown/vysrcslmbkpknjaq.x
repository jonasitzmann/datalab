<p>
Experimental results of a laboratory study simulating coastal currents developing from estuarine fresh-water discharges into the ocean are discussed. The depth, the width and the propagation velocity of the developing currents are studied as a function of the background rotation rate, the volumetric discharge rate at the source and the density difference mediating the current motion.
Data from two complementing sets of experiments are compared to each other. One set was carried out in a tank on a small-scale rotating turntable with a diameter of 1 m. The second was conducted at the <a href='http://www.coriolis-legi.org'>Coriolis Facility </a>(LEGI, Grenoble) which has a tank diameter of 13 m.
A simple geostrophic model for the flow is developed. The predictions of the model are compared to the experimental data in terms of a set of non-dimensional parameters derived from a dimensional analysis of the flow problem.
