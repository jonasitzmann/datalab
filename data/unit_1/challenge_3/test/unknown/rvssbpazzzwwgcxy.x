<H1>Some advice about completing a DPhil</H1>
<P>
Having just finished the whole process of writing up a thesis, printing it out, getting it bound, submitting it and, of course, having the viva, I've decided to put a few (hopefully) useful hints on this page which may be of some use, particularly to people in AOPP. This is <b> not </b> intended to be the definitive guide to completing a DPhil, but if it eases the pain a bit for anyone then it's worth it!

<H1>1. Writing up. </H1>

<H3>1.1 Writing the thesis. </H3>

This section includes some information on a few of the things I used during the writing up phase, e.g. <a href="latex.html">LaTex</a> for word-processing, GraDs and IDL for plotting. In particular, there is a template LaTex thesis file, which also includes some basics on using and setting up bibliographies, using sections, referencing or citing, and incorporating tables, pictures, equations and figures.

<H3>1.2 Printing it out. </H3>

My main tip here is make sure you leave enough time - especially if you have a lot of colour plots, which take forever. Also make sure that the printer doesn't cut off the bottom of some pages - I didn't print out anything in colour until the last possible moment, to conserve toner, and then only noticed half way through that on the colour printer (taz) lines were missed on some of the fuller pages.

<H3>1.3 Getting it bound. </H3>

I took mine to The Oxford Print Centre (36 Holywell Street, 01865 240409 or 240442), which bound two copies in ten minutes at a cost (in April 2001) of 5 pounds each. I can't guarantee that this will always be possible, and I have no idea whether somewhere else does a better job (although mine seemed fine) or be cheaper (apparently physics photographic cost about half this, but take overnight). I would, however, recommend you be aware of this place, as the last thing you want to worry about if you can't wait to submit is saving 5 pounds! Presto Print also does binding at its St. Clements office (31 St. Clements Street, 01865 201320).

You will need to submit two soft bound copies for your examiners, and take them, complete with the appropriate paperwork, pre-labelled packaging and your contact details, to the university offices at Wellington Square, Graduate Studies Office. You will generally find that people there are quick to realise your situation, as there is something unmistakeable about a harried individual holding large brown envelopes extremely protectively.

<H1>2. The viva. </H1>

Too recent to comment on without shaking. <b> However</b>, good news for those of you who were undergraduates at Oxford and therefore need to wear a BA (white fur) hood for it - a departmental one is currently available, and is being paid for gradually as people need to borrow it (at 3 pounds per person it will be paid for and therefore free to future students after another 6 or so people have used it). Just ask me about it. It can also be borrowed for graduation ceremonies. I'm afraid I can't help with the gown, though. Try asking around, or borrow one from <a href="http://www.shepherdandwoodward.co.uk">Shepherd and Woodward</a>. <b> NB </b> - you need the BA hood even if you have an MPhys.
