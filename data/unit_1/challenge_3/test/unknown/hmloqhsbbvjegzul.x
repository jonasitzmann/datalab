<p>Mrs Dunlop, Ms Dunn and Mr McGregor will fill vacancies left by resignations from the Board of the Company over the last year.

<p>Welcoming the new members, the Minister said: &#8220;I am very pleased that Mrs Dunlop, Ms Dunn and Mr McGregor have agreed to accept this position. I am confident that their experience and skill will be invaluable to the Company as it seeks to support the promotion of major events in Northern Ireland.</p>
<p></p>
<h2>Notes to Editors:</h2>
<p>Councillor Mrs Roberta Mahood Dunlop has been a Councillor for North Down Borough Council since 1997 and held the position of Mayor of the Council between 2005 &#8211; 2006.

She started the Bangor International Choral Festival fifteen years ago and is now the Festival Treasurer with a team of fifty volunteers. She is also a member of the North Down Advisory Committee. Councillor Dunlop has considerable experience of organising events such as concerts with the Irish Guards, Royal Marines and RAF etc and was behind the organisation of the 50th Anniversary of the D-Day Landings in Bangor in 1995 which was a highly successful large-scale event. Councillor Dunlop was self-employed for thirty years, fifteen years as a newsagent and the last fifteen years as proprietor of a Bed &amp; Breakfast business.</p>
<p>Ms Nicky Ann Dunn has been the Chief Executive of the Odyssey Arena since 2000, with experience in organising a wide variety of events including sports, concerts, theatre and other cultural events, encompassing all aspects including financial, operational and marketing. Ms Dunn was a member of the Committee which designed and monitored the construction of the Odyssey Arena. Previous positions held include Event Manager and Operations Director at London Arena. Her career of 19 years in Venue Management has gained her considerable experience of attracting world class events for both London and the Odyssey, such as the Brit Awards, professional boxing, tennis competitions, and concerts which included Mamma Mia etc. She is also currently a board member for Crimestoppers NI.</p>
<p>Mr Samuel Thomas McGregor is currently a Board member of HM Prison Magilligan, a Custody Visitor for the Police Authority, a member of the Board of Governors of a local Primary School and a member of the Limavady Sports Council. He also holds a City &amp; Guilds of London Institute. From 1974 to 2005 Mr McGregor was a Director of Development Services for Limavady Borough Council with overall responsibility for strategic policy and planning of the Council&#8217;s Leisure Services and Economic Development Department. During this time he gained invaluable experience of working in partnership with public, private and statutory bodies through representing the Council at Board level on several statutory and Advisory Committees in addition to consultation with the Voluntary and Community sector. Mr McGregor&#8217;s responsibilities included economic and community development and culture, arts and tourism development.</p>
<h3>The appointment process</h3>
<p>All appointments were made on merit and the process was approved by the Office of the Commissioner for Public Appointments for Northern Ireland.</p>
<p>The position of Member of the Northern Ireland Events Company Board is not remunerated.</p>
<p>Political activity plays no part in the selection process. However, in accordance with the original Nolan recommendations, there is a requirement for the political activity of appointees in the last five years (if any declared) to be published.</p>
<p>Mrs Dunlop has declared political activity as a District Councillor, representing the Ulster Unionist Party on North Down Borough Council.</p>
<p>Ms Dunn has not participated in any political activity during the last five years.</p>
<p>Mr McGregor has not participated in any political activity during the last five years.</p>
<h3>The Northern Ireland Events Company</h3>
<p>The Northern Ireland Events Company (NIEC) is a company limited by guarantee. The Department of Culture, Arts and Leisure is the sponsoring department for NIEC and is responsible for allocating resources to the Company and monitoring its performance. </p>
<p>NIEC was set up to give effect to Programme for Government commitments in relation to securing a programme of high profile international sporting and cultural events for Northern Ireland. </p>
<p>The strategic aim of NIEC is to support the promotion of major events in Northern Ireland which have the potential to:</p>
<ul><li>impact positively on the image of Northern Ireland and in particular its external image;</li>
<li>create opportunity for social cohesion; and</li>
<li>bring direct or indirect benefits to Northern Ireland.</li></ul>
<p>In pursuit of this aim, NIEC has defined its role as being:</p>
<p>To contribute to improving the social and economic status of Northern Ireland, for the benefit of all people, by supporting events, consistent with its aim, which would be unlikely to happen in Northern Ireland without the intervention of the Company. </p>
<p>In developing an events strategy NIEC works closely with other relevant bodies, including the Arts Council, Sports Council, local government and the Tourist Board.</p>
<h3>Future Developments</h3>
<p>Under the Review of Public Administration it was decided that NIEC will be incorporated into the Northern Ireland Tourist Board from 1 April 2008.</p>
