<strong>INTRODUCTION</strong><br>
Welcome to the second Harvest of the CERES on-line era.  In this Harvest there is a
pretty healthy crop of new resources, which we hope will bring much pleasure.
<p>
<hr>
<h2 align=center>ELECTRONIC RESOURCES</h2>
<p>
<strong>OCTAVO</strong><br>
<cite>A few words from our top Gizmo Correspondent, Colin Burrow</cite>
<p>
The American publishers Octavo have begun a series of electronic
reproductions of early modern books, which combine the pleasures and detail
of a photographic facsimile with the convenience - say it, pastability - of
e-texts. So far they offer Hooke's <cite>Micrographia</cite>, Newton's <cite>Opticks</cite>,
Shakespeare's <cite>Poems (1640)</cite>, with a variety of goodies planned for future
publication, including Johnson's <cite>Dictionary</cite>, Harvey on the circulation of
the blood and Vesalius's <cite>De Humani Corporis Fabrica</cite>. The focus is on texts with a large visual component, but they are also promising some more texty
texts such as <cite>Areopagitica</cite> in the near future.
<p>
What do you get? Well, the great thing about the series is that the texts
come as PDF files which can be viewed with an Adobe Acrobat viewer. This is
free, small, quite fast, and many people will have it anyway installed on
their systems. It enables you to view the volumes in near-photographic
quality (you can see things like show through from the previous page,
splodges of ink, torn corners, even the indentations made by individual
pieces of type -- although real bibliographers might grouse at the lack of
good shots of watermarks). You can also zoom in, scroll down, and navigate
through the volume by means of hyperlinks. Rudimentary keyword searches are
possible as well as more sophisticated proximity searches. And you can
paste text from what appears to be a photograph into a word-processor.
Pages can be viewed in three levels of detail: Print (which is black and
white and works fast), Browse (which is in decent colour, but which
disables text copying), Read (which is in good colour quality and which
enables copying text) and Examine (which is extremely high detail, with
pixels only becoming visible at 800x magnification). Examine mode is
slowish on a Pentium 166, but Read mode lets you, well, read. And Octavo
have cleverly made it look as though you are turning the pages as you move
through the volume.
<p>
The limitations are mostly those of the Adobe Acrobat Viewer. Copying text
works quite well, except that if you copy the bottom half of one page on an
opening you also as far as I could tell have to copy the text at the bottom
of the facing page. Sometimes text pasted from the 1640 Shakespeare's poems
lost its line-endings. But one can live with this once one knows it's a
problem. There are nice touches: a problem with the 1640 volume is finding
which of Benson's combined and retitled sonnets correspond to the numbers
in Thorpe's Quarto. Octavo get round this by having a side bar which lets
you hop to the poems in their 1609 numberings.
<p>
This is good stuff. And it is cheap: the Shakespeare volume is 25 US
dollars plus 3 dollars postage. Now think of a wish list (Milton's Poems
1645, the Jonson Folio, Herrick's Hesperides ...). Me, I'm waiting for the
Vesalius: can't wait to see all those bodies pulling their flesh off, and
all for 75 US dollars...

<strong>ARTS AND HUMANITIES DATA SERVICE</strong><br>
The Joint Information Systems Committee of the United Kingdom's Higher
Education Funding Councils (or rather, the JISC of the UK's HEFCs) fund
this attempt to collect and catalogue and offer good quality electronic
resources on-line. Those who are in love with the Internet's fragmented
side and who enjoy picking up a text of Milton in Perth and then a text of
Marvell in the other Perth won't see the point of it, but there is
something to be said for a body which considers the best ways of creating
publicity, access, and protocols for serious research resources which have
often taken a lot of effort to produce. Also, the one thing education
systems need is lots of committees, as any member of the NAFH working group
of the PTTP committee of CERES can tell you.
<p>
So far the literary material is basically the Oxford Text Archive and the
link from AHDS sends you straight there. We already have a link to OTA on
our web page so that's not a great advance. The History materials are more
impressive although AHDS again acts as a central linking hub. One of CERES'
most oft-repeated sententiae is that there is a lot of potential here and
it could become a wonderful resource (particularly in this case for its
interdisciplinary possibilities) BUT that depends on the contributions made
by people like us. At this stage the food for thought here is mainly for
those who are thinking of putting resources on-line themselves. Find the
AHDS at <a href=http://ahds.ac.uk>http://ahds.ac.uk</a>.
<p>
<strong>NEW ISSUES OF EMLS AND RENAISSANCE FORUM</strong><br>
<cite>Early Modern Literary Studies</cite> 4.1 is out, based at
<a href=http://purl.oclc.org/emls/emlshome.html>http://purl.oclc.org/emls/emlshome.html</a>.  Articles include...
<ul>
<li>'Jonson's Stoic Politics: Lipsius, the Greeks, and the Speach According to Horace' by Robert C. Evans.
<li>'Petruchio's Horse: Equine and Household Management in The Taming of the

<li>'"Corrupt with goodly meede": Munera and Medusa in Book 5 of Spenser's The
Faerie Queene'by Joan Fitzpatrick.
</ul>
PLUS Reviews galore and all the usual EMLS services.
<p>
<cite>Renaissance Forum</cite> 3.1 is out, based at <a href=http://www.hull.ac.uk/renforum>http://www.hull.ac.uk/renforum</a>.  Articles include...
<ul>
<li>James Fitzmaurice on Jane Barker and the Tree of Knowledge at Cambridge
University.
<li>Lisa Hopkins on Knowing their loves: knowledge, ignorance, and blindness in
Tis Pity She's a Whore.
<li>Andrew Stewart on Some Uses for Romance: Shakespeare's Cymbeline and

</ul>
And plenty of reviews here too!
<p>
<strong>MONTPELLIER EARLY MODERN ENGLISH DOCUMENTS (MEMED)</strong><br> 
...is at <a href=http://alor.univ-montp3.fr/MEMED/>http://alor.univ-montp3.fr/MEMED/</a>.
<p>
Currently this service is offering <cite>A Declaration of the Sentence and
Deposition of Elizabeth, the usurper and pretensed Queen of England</cite> (1588),
<cite>The Pater Noster, the Creed, and the commandments of God in English, with
many other godly lessons, right necessary for youth and all other to learn
and to know, according to the commandment and injunctions given by the
authority of the king's highness through this his realm</cite> (1538), and William
Elderton's <cite>A New Ballad declaring the dangerous shooting of the gun at court</cite> (1579).
<p>
All of these are in HTML format although it is planned that all documents
will eventually be offered in RTF format as well (RTF will be more easily
accommodated by your word-processing software). More transcriptions are
underway.
<p>
Also now based at the University of Montpellier is the home-page of the
Societe Francaise Shakespeare: <a href=http://alor.univ-montp3.fr/serinf/SFS/>http://alor.univ-montp3.fr/serinf/SFS/</a>. This has details of the Society, and details of its activities and congresses since 1979.
<p>
The Centre d'Etudes et de Recherches sur la Renaissance Anglaise has a
large collection of Shakespearean videos which have been catalogued at
<a href=http://alor.univ-montp3.fr/serinf/CERRA/Shakespeare_Multimedia/>http://alor.univ-montp3.fr/serinf/CERRA/Shakespeare_Multimedia/
</a>.  The list gives a lot of information about each film and could help solve
those 'who was that guy who played Macduff in that weird version which was
all dark' questions.
<p>
<strong>ABRAHAM COWLEY ON-LINE ARCHIVE</strong><br>
New images are being added all the time at <a href=http://etext.virginia.edu/kinney/>http://etext.virginia.edu/kinney/</a>.
<p>
At present this site, maintained by Daniel Kinney, has two texts by Cowley
- <cite>The Third Part of the Works of Mr. Abraham Cowley Being his Six Books of
Plants</cite> (1689), and <cite>Translation of the Sixth Book of Mr. Cowley's Plantarum</cite> (1680) - which can be read and searched. It also has many pictures of Cowley, his works, and of many related sources.
<p>
As one would expect given its affiliation to the Electronic Text Center at
Virginia, this site is sensibly organised and the reproductions are very
good. The archive is introduced at <a href=http://etext.virginia.edu/kinney/about.html> http://etext.virginia.edu/kinney/about.html</a>.
<p>
<strong>BIDS AUTOJOURNALS</strong><br>
Find out about this service at <a href=http://www.bids.ac.uk/news/autojnls.html>http://www.bids.ac.uk/news/autojnls.html</a>. The deal is that BIDS will e-mail the Contents Pages of journals when they
are catalogued at BIDS - which is very frequently. If you love browsing the
periodicals shelves then this will spoil your fun, but do you really catch
everything of interest? Really?
<p>
One wonderful feature is that you can customize your own list of journals
from the huge list at BIDS. Although it can take quite a while to trawl
through and choose the ones you want, this can be very useful as it points
to which periodicals aren't there. BIDS is great, but it is not perfect.
Then again, the MLA Bibliography doesn't do this (or we don't think it does
anyway). If your institution is with the programme, enjoy!
<p>
<strong>MORE RENASCENCE EDITIONS</strong><br>
