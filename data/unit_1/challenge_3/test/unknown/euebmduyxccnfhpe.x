<b> Still in work </b>

<p>
Calibration of the HIRDLS instrument is the primary method of determining the characteristics of
the instrument response to input radiance prior to delivery to the spacecraft integrator and
thence to mission operation. 

A purpose built facility has been developed at Oxford University for the calibration of HIRDLS.
This consists in essence of a clean room, a vacuum chamber with thermal control services,
of calibration equipment consisting of a source of variable monochromatic radiation, a
broad-band point source and full aperture radiance sources.

The requirements and specifications for the pre-launch calibration are detailed in the 
documents: <sp-hir-007> <>. In summary, these requirements flow directly from the instrument
mission requirements, which define the resolution and accuracy of measurement required
from the HIRDLS instrument. 

These requirements lead directly to the specifications for the calibration equipment and 
include, for example, the knowledge requirement for the temperature of the external 
black bodies, the wavelength knnowledge of the monochromator and relative output intensity.

<p>
The concept for the calibration activity is for all the calibration equipment to be
installed and operated simulatensously in the vacuum chamber with the HIRDLS instrument.
