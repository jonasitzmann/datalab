<br />
<p>Abertay's Student Centre is slap bang in the middle of our friendly city campus, just yards from our award winning library and main teaching buildings. We've invested &pound;6 million into getting it just right, from the beautiful red sandstone to the inspiring green cladding with glass front. The Student Centre is more than just a building - it&rsquo;s the cultural and social hub of our city campus and is a safe, stimulating environment in which to eat, relax and socialise with friends and meet with lecturers. In keeping with our  library it really stands out as a place of beauty and innovation and with the Students' Association it encompasses numerous services including student welfare, entertainment, clubs and societies. </p>
<h3>What&rsquo;s inside the Student Centre?<span class="style4">
  
</span></h3>
<h3 class="style2">The Basement /Nightclub </h3>
<p>Capable of holding around 350 people the basement is an excellent venue for student nights, start of term parties and freshers' week. It also hosts some great specialist nights such as guest DJ's, small bands,   Afro Nights, Bangra Nights and charity functions.</p>
<h3 class="style2">JS Campus Bookstore</h3>
<p>The Abertay student bookstore sells a wide range of books for all courses that the University of Abertay offers as well as popular non-fiction and fiction books. Plus a great range of discount priced CD&rsquo;s, DVD&rsquo;s, cards, and a small shop that sells the essential student needs. A 10% discount card is offered to all University staff while students receive special offers at the start of term. With friendly staff to help you out, a coffee shop in the foyer area and the main lecture theatre across the road - all needs are covered. </p>
<h3 class="style2">Foyer/The coffee bar/retail unit</h3>
<p>The building has an open, welcoming and comfortable foyer space with a central reception point and great seating which overlooks the  library and pedestrianised area. It has a relaxed atmosphere where students can have a quiet break between classes, a chance to sit down, have a coffee and review notes with classmates. A small shop sells sandwiches, snacks, tea, coffee and stationary items. A real grab and go atmosphere about it.</p>
<h3 class="style2">Level One/Lounge Bar and Diner</h3>
<p>The hub of the centre and a great place to eat, study, relax and meet your friends for coffee or hot food. The diner sells affordable, nutritional, quality meals to suit all tastes and is bright with natural light from the windows. Large TV screens play music channels and there are pool tables at the back. The room is split into two levels so whether you want to study quietly or meet with friends you can.</p>
<h3 class="style2"> </h3>
<h3 class="style2">Level Two Lounge/Sports Bar </h3>
<p>A buzzing area with an atmosphere that never seems to sleep.&nbsp; Students can drop in for a game of pool, watch the large TV screens located throughout the room to show sporting events or attend the many sports clubs and societies that use this room as a meeting point to hold various functions. The bar is the venue for special event evenings such as quiz nights and karaoke.</p>
<h3 class="style2">The Hannah Maclure Centre</h3>
<p>The Hannah Maclure Centre is located on the top floor of the new Abertay Student Centre in the heart of the campus and provides an informal and cultural space for students and staff to present, engage and interact with the exhibitions. The Centre also houses a state of the art cinema and performance space that seats 80 and runs an experimental film and video series along side student film nights and a multitude of one off screenings, performances and seminars.</p>
<p>The Centre works with contemporary and interdisciplinary cultural producers and artists from the UK and abroad, as well as supporting teaching activity and developing opportunities with staff and students. The innovative programme of exhibitions, film and video screenings, seminars, artist talks and outreach, aims to explore the creative, social and educational impact of contemporary arts practice. The main space can be booked for conferences and has both a fully equipped coffee area and a large balcony for outside use that boasts stunning views over Dundee. </p>
<p>Other facilities include wireless internet access for laptop use throughout the centre, publications, art periodicals and information on other cultural venues and events in the region. This facility is open to students, staff and the general public.</p>
