<h2>Growing the future </h2>
<h3>Insect pests and their control-workshop report</h3>


 <p>&quot;Growing the Future&quot; workshops were
      conceived as a process whereby public awareness could be created about
      some of the complex problems associated with crop production nationally
      and internationally. By bringing a small group of scientific researchers
      and thinkers together with others whom might challenge their assumptions
      and perspectives the intention has been to distil some important messages
      that can be placed into the public domain through the media. The intention
      is to produce an authoritative, scientific analysis of a set of
      closely-focused topics. There is an urgent need for well-considered and
      balanced scientific analyses on important issues to reach the general
      public as well as those who influence opinion and political decision
      making. This outcome was considered sufficiently important for two
      independent charitable trusts (Lawes Trust and John Innes Foundation) to
      provide the necessary financial support for the first workshop.</p>
      <p>Agriculture in general and science
      of relevance to agriculture in particular have had a bad press in the UK
      for several years. Three acronyms tell the story: BSE, GM, FMD. The very
      requirement for a domestic agriculture and primary food production is now
      challenged by some. There are others who argue that the way in which food
      is produced needs to be radically changed. Yet others have a conviction
      that solutions to all problems reside in new technologies and a free
      market. One thing is clear however, the public and even influential
      members of society are not being clearly enough presented with the means
      of discriminating scientific fact from fiction.</p>
      <p>Humanity needs options for the
      solution of some enduring problems and there has never been a time when
      science had more to offer. Global food security in the face of an
      expanding population, the inadequate nutrition of many hundreds of
      millions of people, environmental degradation associated with agriculture
      and increasing reliance on non-renewable resources for food production are
      representative of a complex of problems where the world looks to science
      for solutions. Paradoxically, in the affluent west, the application of
      advances in biosciences is treated with suspicion. Safe, varied and
      relatively cheap food is plentiful and there are those who question the
      need for new technologies. Yet others suggest that science has been the
      root cause of problems associated with a food supply chain where consumers
      are increasingly divorced from producers.</p>
      <p>&quot;Insect Pests and their
      Control&quot; is therefore the first of a series of workshops. It is
      essential for farmers to keep in check the insect pests that are vigorous
      competitors for the carbohydrate, protein, oils and fibre they seek to
      harvest for our well-being. However, the need and options for the control
      of insect pests of crops provides an example of a component of
      agricultural production about which there has been controversy; in this
      case, the widespread use of insecticides and concerns over their impact on
      human health and the environment. Some important messages from this
      workshop are summarised below.</p>

      <h3>Growing the Future Report</h3>
      <h4>OVERVIEW OF INSECT PROBLEMS</h4>
      <p>Ian Denholm (Rothamsted Research)</p>
      
      <p>The damage to food and fibre
      production from insect pests, although difficult to quantify, is
      potentially devastating. Different pests attack crops in different ways,
      causing direct damage through feeding or contamination of produce, or by
      transmitting a wide range of plant diseases.</p>
      
      <p>The primary causes of pest outbreaks
      include:</p>
      
      <ul>
        <li>High concentrations of crops in monocultures</li>
        <li>Crop physiology being optimised for yield, and
          potentially increasing vulnerability to pests and diseases</li>
        <li>Loss of or reduction in beneficial insect
          reservoirs to provide natural pest control</li>
        <li>Year-round cropping allowing pests to breed
          without interruption</li>
        <li>Inadvertent movement of pests by human agency</li>
        <li>Over-reliance on insecticides</li>
      </ul>
      
      <p>Other important factors relate to
      the attributes of the pests themselves:</p>
      
      <ul>
        <li>Pest occurrence is often difficult to predict
          (due to complex population dynamics)</li>
        <li>Growers may have to contend with many different
          pest species at once</li>
        <li>Pest distributions can change (e.g. through
          climate change or importation)</li>
        <li>Evolutionary changes may occur (e.g. development
          of insecticide resistance)</li>
      </ul>
      
      <p>One insect pest that exemplifies
      many of these factors is the cotton or tobacco whitefly (<i>Bemisia tabaci</i>).
      It causes direct damage to specific crops such as cotton, but is probably
      more important as a vector of at least 60 plant viruses e.g. those
      affecting tomatoes and other vegetable crops. Due to its genetic
      plasticity, <i>B. tabaci</i> consists of a number of different races or
      &quot;biotypes&quot; that are morphologically indistinguishable but differ
      in important biological traits such as host plant range. Some biotypes are
      of extreme economic importance, others seem entirely benign. The spatial
      distribution of different biotypes can change over time. For example, both
      &quot;B&quot; and &quot;Q&quot; biotype variants of whitefly occurred
      around the Iberian Peninsula in 1995, but by 2000 only the &quot;Q&quot;
      type could be found. The reason for these rapid changes in biotype
      distribution is not known. It could be a result of changes in agronomic
      practices, or the result of one biotype developing insecticide resistance
      faster than the other. More research is needed in this area.</p>
      
      <h4>Living with insecticide resistance</h4>
      
      <p>Insecticide resistance is a
      widespread and still increasing phenomenon. Approximately 540 species of
      arthropods have been reported to resist at least one class of insecticide.
      These include:</p>
      
      <p>c. 310 agricultural pests</p>
      <p>c. 200 pests of medical/veterinary
      importance</p>
      <p>c. 30 beneficial species (e.g.
      predators and parasitoids that can be used in integrated pest management
      strategies)</p>
      
      <p>The peach-potato aphid (<i>Myzus
      persicae</i>) feeds on crops such as lettuce, potatoes and brassicas. It
      has a high propensity to develop insecticide resistance, and possesses
      three different resistance mechanisms: one based on the overproduction of
      a carboxylesterase (which confers resistance to organophosphorus
      insecticides), one based on a modification of acetylcholinesterase (which
      confers resistance to carbamates) and one based on mutation in the
      voltage-gated sodium channel in nerve membranes (which confers resistance
      to pyrethroids). All of these resistance mechanisms can occur in a single
      aphid clone. Between 1996 (a year of serious aphid outbreaks) and 2001,
      the frequency of these mechanism tended to decline, probably due to less
      intensive use of pesticides. However, resistance levels can decline even
      in the face of continued pesticide application due to resistance
      mechanisms imposing a biological cost on their carriers such as reduced
      overwintering ability or decreased responsiveness to external stimuli.</p>
      
      <p>Whiteflies (<i>Bemisia tabaci</i>)
      are a major pest of cotton in Israel. They became a particular problem in
      the late 1980s and a strategy was put together to conserve the natural
      enemies of this pest during the early part of the growing season. This
      strategy also involved not using any chemical compound more than once in a
      season to minimize the selection pressure for resistance. The strategy was
      successful and pesticide use decreased dramatically. In 1986, 10-14
      applications per season were used to control whiteflies on cotton. By 1997
      this had fallen to 1-2 applications per season.</p>
      
      <p>Despite this success, some
      resistance problems have arisen. In particular, resistance to the juvenile
      hormone analogue, pyriproxyfen, increased rapidly in some areas of Israel
      even though growers applied this compound only once per season. This
      appears to have been a consequence of whitefly ecology. In some isolated
      valleys in Israel, cotton may the only only whitefly host available at the
      time that pyriproxyfen is applied. Thus, almost all insects are exposed to
      the insecticide and selected for resistance. In other areas where
      alternative hosts are present, resistance has not arisen or has developed
      much more slowly. An understanding of pest ecology is of great benefit in
      formulating countermeasures for resistance, as it is for developing
      sustainable pest management strategies in general.</p>
      
      <p>Another pest that has a propensity
      to develop resistance rapidly is the cotton bollworm (<i>Helicoverpa
      armigera</i>), a major pest of cotton in the Old World tropics and
      subtropics. In extreme cases (as in parts of China and India) resistance
      precipitated a 'pesticide treadmill', whereby farmers were resorting
      to up to 30-40 sprays per season, many consisting of a cocktail of active
      ingredients. One alternative approach to bollworm control is to adopt
      transgene technology involing the use of cotton genetically modified to
      express insecticidal toxins derived from the bacterium <i>Bacillus
      thuringienses</i> (so-called 'Bt cotton'). This has been pioneered in
      Australia and the USA. In Australia, Bt cotton (tradename INGARD) now
      occupies c. 30% of the cotton growing area, and has led to a c. 50%
      reduction in the number of insecticide sprays against bollworms. However,
      pests are also capable of developing resistance to Bt toxins, and to
      counter this the acreage of Bt cotton permitted in Australia has been
      capped at 30% until new transgenic varieties expressing two distinct Bt
      toxins become available. In addition, every 100 ha of Bt cotton must be
      accompanied by non-Bt refuge to promote the survival of susceptible moths.
      There has been high compliance with this strategy, and to date there is no
      evidence of Bt cotton failing to control bollworms due to resistance
      development.</p>
      
      <p>China adopted Bt cotton more
      recently, but in 2001 between 1.6 and 1.7 million ha (c. 40% of all cotton
      grown) consisted of transgenic varieties. As in Australia, Chinese farmers
      are claiming a substantial reduction in insecticide sprays on Bt cotton
      compared to conventional varieties. However, in China there has been no
      attempt to use refuge crops to combat resistance. The critical question is
      whether this more indiscriminate use of transgenic crops for insect
      control is sustainable. Only time will tell.</p>
      
      <h4>Discussion</h4>
      <ul>
      <li>There is a lack of comprehensive information about
        the extent of damage by insect pests. The conventionally quoted figure
        is that losses amount to about 40% of crop biomass. Some databases exist
        (e.g. the <i>Liaison</i> database from the UK Central Science
        Laboratory). However such information is incomplete and additional
        opportunities exist to include factors such as host range, epidemiology
        and natural enemies.</li>
      </ul>
      
      <ul>
        <li>When assessing the likelihood or impact of a
          potential pest outbreak it is important to look at the relative
          importance of the factors that cause attacks. Research is needed to
          discover the relative importance of the environmental changes
          involved.</li>
      </ul>
      
      <ul>
        <li>In assessing causal factors, the degree of
          geographical isolation of cropping systems is important. The situation
          becomes more complicated as the area becomes larger and less isolated
          and causes become more difficult to identify and to separate. Causal
          factors also change with time, as in Uzbekistan where over-reliance on
          pesticides has ceased to be the primary cause of pest out breaks.</li>
      </ul>
      
      <ul>
        <li>Caution should be exercised in drawing
          conclusions from different situations until all influences are
          accounted for. For example, comparisons between the development of
          resistance to Bt cotton in Australia and China have little meaning
          because, although there is no refuge policy in China, only 40% of
          farmers are using Bt cotton, ostensibly leaving 60% as the refuge.
          However, in some Chinese provinces nearly 100% of the crop is Bt
          cotton thus there is no refuge in those areas.</li>
      </ul>
      
      <p>It could be argued that transgenic crops are
      pesticide analogues and the most significant challenge is to find
      innovative ways of moving away from over reliance on pesticides.
      Understanding complete systems is critically important. For example, a
      transgenic form of the mosquito <i>Anopheles gambii</i> that does not
      transmit malaria would inhibit the spread of the disease but it would be
      vital to know how to integrate it into natural<font SIZE="2"> populations
      and any other effects that this might have.</p>

      <h3>OVERVIEW OF INSECTICIDES AND THEIR
      USES</h3>
      <h4>John Casida (University of
      California, Berkely, USA)</h4>
      
      <p>Insects have always been a
      significant problem to human welfare. The specific goal of insecticide
      research is to produce new products and methods for the safe and effective
      control of pests, thereby maximising food production and public health
      benefit.</p>
      <p>Significant issues in insecticide
      research are:</p>
      
      <ul>
        <li>The evolution of insecticides</li>
        <li>Resistance as a challenge</li>
        <li>GM crops</li>
        <li>Changing priorities in research</li>
      </ul>
      
      <b>
      <p>Evolution of insecticides</p>
      </b>
      
      <p>The development of insecticides
      follow a broad timescale:</p>
      
      <p>1940s- chlorinated hydrocarbons</p>
      <p>1950s- organophosphates</p>
      <p>1960s- methyl carbamates</p>
      <p>1970s- pyrethroids</p>
      <p>1980s and 1990s- diverse types,
      &quot;the neonicotinoid era&quot;</p>
      
      <p>Current usage of insecticides:</p>
      
      <ul>
        <li>Chlorinated hydrocarbons- DDT is still in use in
          some areas</li>
        <li>Organophosphates- 85 of these have been
          superseded. 69 are still in use but only 10 are still of major
          importance</li>
        <li>Carbamates- half have been lost from use</li>
        <li>Pyrethroids- 26 are still in use, 7 have been
          superseded</li>
        <li>Neonicotinoids- none of these have yet been
          superseded because they are still new</li>
      </ul>
      
      <p>In terms of mechanisms of action,
      90% of insecticides are nerve poisons (attacking the Na<sup>+</sup>
      channel or Cl<sup>-</sup> channel or cholinergic system) and 10% are
      respiratory inhibitors and growth regulators.</p>
      
      <ul>
        <li>Indoxacarb is a Dupont compound and a
          lepidoptericide. It was an important development, but is complex to
          synthesise.</li>
      </ul>
      
      <ul>
        <li>Spinosad is a nerve poison with low toxicity to
          mammals. It has good properties, but is hard to produce inexpensively.</li>
      </ul>
      
      <ul>
        <li>Rotenone is an example of a respiratory
          inhibitor/uncoupler . It is highly toxic to fish and problems of
          insect resistance are developing.</li>
      </ul>
      
      <ul>
        <li>Insect growth regulators should be an ideal pest
          control mechanism; e.g. the synthetic analogue of juvenile hormone,
          but they work relatively slowly so do not have a major market in crop
          protection.</li>
      </ul>
      
      <ul>
        <li>Botanical insecticides include pyrethrum,
          nicotine, rotenone and azadirachtin.</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h4>Resistance as a challenge</h4>
      
      <p>Too many pesticides work on too few
      biochemical targets in the insect and the discovery of new targets are
      significant events. In order to circumvent the development of
      cross-resistance, individual insecticides should be used sparingly, for
      example by using only one treatment per season.</p>
      
      <p>Whilst there is a very large number
      of potential toxins, there are significantly fewer targets, such as sodium
      channels, and most of these are impractically slow or too insensitive.
      Trying to expand the arsenal against insect pests means examining the
      available weapons. There are a number of possible candidates:</p>
      
      <ul>
        <li>Chemical toxicants (there is still a strong
          dependence on these)</li>
        <li>Natural products</li>
        <li>GM crops</li>
        <li>Behaviour modifiers</li>
      </ul>
      
      <p>Pesticide use in all of these
      classes is being restricted. Pesticide attrition is occurring for many
      reasons, one of which is that when the patent runs out there is no
      incentive to retain registration.</p>
      
      <p>Insects are great survivors. They
      are insensitive targets- a simple change in a single *amino acid, or an
      altered binding site or cross-resistance can wipe out the effectiveness of
      a whole class of insecticidal compounds. There are also many insect
      enzymes that detoxify insecticides e.g. p450 oxidases, GSH S transferases
      (these break down many insecticides including DDT) and esterases (which
      can hydrolyse pyrethroids).</p>
      
      <p>New strategies are needed to delay
      the selection pressure for pesticide resistance to evolve and also to find
      new targets in the pest.</p>
      
      <h4>GM crops</h4>
      
      <p>Organisms can be modified to make
      them resistant to attack:</p>
      
      <ul>
        <li>Bt maize, Bt soybean, Bt cotton, Bt rice</li>
        <li>It would be possible to create pesticide
          resistant parasites and predators</li>
        <li>Pests could be genetically modified to make them
          more sensitive to pesticides</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h4>Changing priorities in research</h4
      
      ><p>Advances in pest control, through
      the discovery of new compounds and applications, is aided by novel
      compound combinations, genomics, proteomics and molecular modelling.</p>
      
      <p>New biotechnology and GMOs are
      having a positive impact. However rapid development is limited as there
      are now only six major companies involved in pesticide R&amp;D.</p>
      
      <p>New priorities are impacting on
      effectiveness, including the focus on health and the environment, the
      imperative for a reduced emphasis on chemicals and less support for
      pesticide research. There is a changing worldview (and therefore changed
      funding priorities) encapsulated in the phrases &quot;Save the world from
      famine and disease&quot; to &quot;Save the world from pesticides and GM
      crops.&quot; In the United States, Federal funding has shifted from food
      production and crop protection to health and the environment. In
      University research and teaching there are fewer people with a research
      specialisation in insecticide chemistry and toxicology, but there are
      still elements of this subject taught in environmental science, policy and
      management university courses.</p>
      
      <p>New priorities and new players mean
      that new agents, targets and a better understanding of mechanisms of
      action are required. Pesticides can be ideal probes to investigate living
      systems such as the nervous system and efforts have to be focused on
      minimising resistance development to conserve pesticides as a finite
      resource.</p>
      
      <h4>Discussion</h4>
      
      <ul>
        <li>Whilst most research is at present directed to
          identifying compounds in plants with toxicological properties, an
          alternative approach might be to examine plant responses to attack.
          The number of biochemical targets for pesticide action is limited
          because fast acting and cost-effective compounds are required. This
          means that the nervous system is the most frequent target. Other
          compounds, such as ecdysone inhibitors might be slower, but their
          ultimate impact might be more effective. Many insect proteins are
          unique and do not have human equivalents or relations. With the
          ability to reconstruct proteins it should be possible to produce new,
          highly effective, insecticidal compounds that have few side effects in
          man.</li>
      </ul>
      
      <ul>
        <li>Education, both for consumers and for farmers,
          will be important if slower acting insecticides are to become a
          significant element of the armoury. However the process will be
          difficult as people are conditioned to the need for fast treatment of
          human disease and the fast acting effects of insect nerve poisons.</li>
      </ul>
      
      <ul>
        <li>Farmers are part of society. They respond to
          economic and political signals and information from scientists may be
          unclear. The range of constraints applied by society to the use of
          potentially useful compounds severely limits the number of targets, in
          herbicides as well as pesticides. This may mean that farmers have to
          accept lower yields and perhaps society should be prepared to pay a
          premium for this.</li>
      </ul>
      
      <ul>
        <li>There is pressure from the public to reduce the
          environmental impact of pesticides. It is increasingly less
          economically viable to register pesticides. It can cost around £60
          million to bring a new compound to registration level. Compounds are
          continually being lost from use due to the cost of reviewing them. In
          2003 the number of active ingredients in Europe will drop drmatically.
          It is possible that food retailers, responding to consumer feedback,
          might dictate the products used on food. Additionally, the number of
          major pesticide manufacturers will drop at a rate of about one per
          year.</li>
      </ul>
      
      <ul>
        <li>Higher specificity from natural compounds
          improves targeting but reduces the spectrum of application. The costs
          involved in registration remain the same. New products have to be
          broad spectrum to be commercially feasible. Any rationalisation of the
          registration process would raise anxieties of reduced safety
          standards, even though many of the animal tests used are not
          significant terms of reducing risk to the human population.
          Comparisons are often made with the pharmaceutical industry but the
          all-important difference is that insect targets represent only a very
          small part of the environment to which a chemical compound might be
          applied.</li>
      </ul>
      
      <ul>
        <li>Every insecticide has different properties and
          the loss of one may lead to significant gaps in crop protection.
          Public pressure may change the situation when the loss in quality or
          availability become apparent. A considerable number of active
          chemicals is being lost every year and the public is generally unaware
          of the consequences of the loss.</li>
      </ul>
      
      <ul>
        <li>Public knowledge of growing systems is limited.
          The public also do not understand estimates of risk, such as MRLs
          (maximum residue levels) and ADI (accepted daily intake). As
          pesticides are normally applied at the threshold of an outbreak,
          rather than prophylactically, the amounts that have to be applied are
          larger and the effect has to be immediate. This can lead to higher
          levels of residue which may be identified and receive negative media
          attention.</li>
      </ul>
      
      <ul>
        <li>There was general agreement that the media does
          not present a balanced view of the scientific facts. Scientists
          themselves do not respond in a concerted and coordinated way to media
          stories. Scientists could make direct approaches to consumers.
          Scientists can set up hypotheses that can be refuted but they can
          never prove a negative, so it is impossible to disprove a link between
          chemical residues and health effects.</li>
      </ul>
      
      <ul>
        <li>In some cases the standards set have to be seen
          against a background of limited information about synthetic compounds
          and their action. However, despite a general assumption that man-made
          compounds are dangerous, many of the 10<sup>8</sup> natural compounds
          in existence are much more toxic and carcinogenic.</li>
      </ul>
      
      <ul>
        <li>There is particular concern about minor crops
          like lettuce and tomatoes where the total amount of pesticide usage
          does not justify the investment required to develop new compounds.</li>
      </ul>
      
      <ul>
        <li>Information is needed about chronic and acute
          toxicity. It is estimated that there are three million acute pesticide
          poisonings each year and 20,000 deaths.</li>
      </ul>
      
      <ul>
        <li>Ideally whole biological systems would be
          investigated but pesticides are rapidly disappearing from use. The
          international perspective is also important, for example London
          requires 300 times its own area to sustain its food supplies and much
          of this food is sourced from overseas.</li>
      </ul>
      
      <ul>
        <li>There is little evidence that the currently used
          pesticides are having a deleterious effect on health. Life expectancy
          is rising and cancer rates in children (those most sensitive to the
          environment) is decreasing. 200 medical investigations have shown that
          a diet high in fruit and vegetables cuts the incidence of cancer. Only
          25% of people currently eat enough fruit and vegetables. Organically
          produced food is more expensive and fruit and vegetable consumption
          would fall if only organic produce were available.</li>

      <h3>BIOLOGICAL CONTROL OPTIONS</h3>
      <h4>Dr Eizi Yano (National Agricultural
      Research Centre, Tsukuba, Japan)</h4>
      <p>This presentation will mainly be confined to the use
      of natural enemies in biological pest control (biological control in the
      strictest sense) but will also discuss the use of semiochemicals. Other
      options for biological control are cultural practices and host plant
      resistance.</p>
      <p>Biological control only accounts for a small
      fraction of a pest control market dominated by synthetic pesticides.
      Nevertheless, natural enemies (predators, parasites or pathogens) are
      currently protecting vast areas of crop (table 1). Biological control
      using natural enemies can be classified as; introduction, augmentation or
      conservation.</p>
      <h4>Introduction of natural enemies</h4>
      <p>Classical biological control is the introduction of
      exotic natural enemies to suppress introduced pests to below economic
      threshold levels. The first famous example of this was introduction of the
      Vedalia beetle, brought into control the cottony cushion scale on citrus
      in California. This form of biological control can be very economical and
      produce a long-term effect. However, success rates are low; of 4769
      introductions recorded in the BIOCAT database only 517 resulted in
      satisfactory control. Successful introductions have mainly been confined
      to the homopteran and lepidopteran orders of insect. It is mainly
      effective for exotic pests and there are also problems of environmental
      safety, including the possible reduction or extinction of indigenous
      species.</p>

      <h4>Augmentation of natural enemies</h4>
      <p>Augmentation is the use of natural enemies (micro or
      macro-organisms) as bio-pesticides. These can be used in inoculation,
      where natural enemies are added a few times and the population grows
      naturally, or augmentation where repeated applications are made. This
      process can be commercialised and in Europe 26 companies produce more than
      80 species of natural enemies. It has a relatively high success rate, is
      effective against both exotic and indigenous pests and can be integrated
      with other control measures, such as selective chemical insecticides. The
      disadvantages are that it is often expensive and reared natural enemies
      may lack effectiveness in the field.</p>
      
      <h4>Conservation of natural enemies</h4>
      <p>The activity of indigenous natural
      enemies can be enhanced by conservation measures such as providing
      physical refuges or food sources or reducing negative agricultural
      practises such as pesticide applications. This approach is cheap and
      preventative but requires in depth knowledge about the pests and
      indigenous natural enemies in local conditions.</p>

      <h4>Regulatory issues</h4>

      <p>Registration of introduced natural
      enemies is required for micro-organisms, but is increasingly needed for
      macro-organisms also. There are legitimate concerns about the effects of
      imported agents on non-target species. For example, the introduction of
      predatory snails in Hawaii led to the extinction or decline of several
      indigenous species. There are a number of regulatory measures in
      operation: for example the FAO has the code of conduct for the import and
      release of exotic biocontrol agents, the UK has the Wildlife and
      Countryside Act and Europe issues guidelines via EPPO.</p>
      
      <p>Quality control is an important factor in assuring
      reliability of natural enemies and may become a factor in the registration
      process. Natural enemy producers in an IOBC working group have cooperated
      to make standards for quality control of natural enemy production.</p>
      
      <h4>Semiochemicals for biocontrol</h4>
      <p>The use of semiochemicals in pest control has
      largely been restricted to Lepidopteran and Coelopteran female sex
      pheromones. These are produced by females to attract males for mating and
      can be synthesised and used for monitoring pest populations, mass trapping
      or mating disruption (table 3). However there are constraints to the
      effectiveness of such techniques. For example, when using pheromone-baited
      traps for monitoring there can be difficulties in relating trap catches to
      population density. Density dependent effects and factors such as wind
      speed and field size can compromise the effectiveness of mating
      disruption.</p>
      <p>Kairomones and synomones can be used to attract
      natural enemies but often fail to boost predation rates. This highlights
      the need for more quantitative research about the role of kairomones or
      synomones in host or prey searching behaviour.</p>

      <h4>Conclusion</h4>
      <p>There is a need for greater
      knowledge of the characteristics of biocontrol measures and the effect of
      environmental variables. Biocontrol has great potential for integration
      with other measures. For example, natural enemies can be used in tandem
      with selective pesticides, resistant cultivars or sex pheromones. It has
      great potential for controlling important pests, which easily develop
      pesticide resistance.</p>
      
      <h4>Discussion</h4>
      <ul>
      <li>There are opportunities to increase the
        effectiveness of natural enemies for example by encouraging learning
        appropriate to that ecosystem.</li>
      </ul>
      
      <ul>
        <li>Regulation is suppressing expansion of the
          biopesticide market, such as mycofungicides. EU regulatory authorities
          lack expertise in this area.</li>
      </ul>
      
      <ul>
        <li>Greater diversity in options for biocontrol of
          insect pests is possible if thinking is not too constrained by ideas
          of conventional pesticide use.</li>
      </ul>
      
      <ul>
        <li>It is important to understand interactions
          between plant, pest and natural enemy and there is considerable scope
          for changing the dynamics of the relationship to crop production
          advantage.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>PLANT DEFENCE MECHANISMS</h3>
      <h4>John Pickett (Rothamsted Research)</h4>
      
      <p>There is considerable scope for the
      use of plant defences but the Bt endotoxin is currently the only compound
      in use in plants commercially. Other proteins like snowdrop lectin are
      still awaiting development.</p>
      
      <p>The main defence of plants against
      pests is based on secondary metabolites. Defence from secondary metabolism
      is normally broad spectrum, for example phytoanticipins are constitutively
      expressed to anticipate a problem of pest attack. Many fruits and cereals
      are defended by such chemicals, for example cherry stones and barley
      contain precursors of cyanide. It is possible to manipulate these natural
      plant defences, e.g. by taking genes from sorghum and putting them into <i>Arabidopsis</i>
      so novel compounds can be made that the pest has not previously
      encountered. Thus, cyanogenic glycosides can be added to brassicas that
      have never occurred there naturally.</p>
      
      <p>The effect of these metabolites
      needs to be tested on insects and regulation could raise significant
      problems. For example, it is likely that the introduction of cyanogenic
      genes to crop plants would be resisted.</p>
      
      <p>Phytoalexins are found in the
      Asteraceae including sunflowers and lettuce. For example, there are
      sesquiterpene lactones that form on the onset of damage by pathogens or
      insects. They are cytotoxic and often carcinogenic so would not be
      desirable candidates for use in genetic modification. Some plants such as
      celery produce photophytodermatitic furanocoumarins. The pathway of
      production is under investigation.</p>
      
      <p>Since the relative toxicity of
      different potential systems varies there needs to be a risk assessment in
      each case.</p>
      
      <h4>Push-Pull systems</h4>
      
      <p>Semiochemicals are potentially a
      powerful tool, but they should be integrated with other systems. The
      push-pull concept is of great potential importance- the pest is pushed
      away from the crop and &quot;pulled&quot; into traps or &quot;trap
      crops&quot;.</p>

      <p>The principles of push-pull
      agricultural systems are:</p>
      
      <ul>
        <li>To use natural biodiversity</li>
        <li>To find out the plants that are attractive and
          repellent to the pest</li>
        <li>To use these to make a trap crop more attractive
          than the main crop or the main crop less attractive</li>
      </ul>

      <p>The aphid sex pheromone has been
      used successfully as an attractant. The sex pheromone is also used as a
      kairomone by parasitic wasps. This type of tool is very popular and the
      public is interested in it. There is a problem with the chemistry used in
      this system, however. The volatile, low molecular weight (166-168)
      compounds have 16 isomeric possibilities and only one is used as a
      signalling cue by the aphid and parasite. Therefore it is very expensive
      to correctly make the right compound. However, by producing these
      chemicals in new industrial crops this problem can be solved.</p>
      
      <p>In Kenya a push-pull system has been
      devised to protect the maize crop against stem borers. An intercrop of a
      legume called molasses grass (<i>Melanis minutifolia</i>) is used, which
      smells like badly damaged maize so has a deterrent effect on the stem
      borer. The molasses grass also attracts parasitoids into the area, which
      will prey on the stem borer. A trap crop of napier grass is grown around
      the maize, which is more attractive to the stem borer than the maize.
      Napier grass does not allow the stem borer insects to develop; they are
      inundated by latex in the late instars of their development. Napier and
      molasses grasses are good cattle food, so are not wasted. Napier grass is
      also a useful grass for controlling soil erosion. Molasses grass in this
      system was found to protect up to 20 rows of maize from stem borer attack.</p>
      
      <h4>Plant signalling</h4>
      <p>When a plant is damaged, a chemical
      signal may be used to attract parasitoid wasps and also warn adjacent
      plants to switch on their defences. The first chemical signal to be
      discovered was methyl jasmonate (jasmonic acid). A similar compound,
      methyl salicylate could be used externally on plants to make them
      anticipate attack. Bion is a signalling compound made by Syngenta that is
      an analogue of methyl salicylate.</p>

      blackcurrant/lettuce aphid. The aphid becomes repelled by the smell of
      blackcurrant (its winter host) in the springtime and thus leaves
      blackcurrant plants in the search for lettuce. Thus, if blackcurrant
      volatiles are added near lettuce, this has a repellent effect on the
      aphid. One compound active in this was <i>cis</i>-jasmone. Other studies
      on this compound showed that it would also attract aphid parasitoids and
      predators. Further research showed that <i>cis</i>-jasmone would, in fact,
      switch on the defences of completely undamaged plants, presenting a new
      tool for inducing plant defence.</p>
      
      <p>If couch grass (<i>Agropyron repens</i>)
      is planted upwind of barley it protects barley plants from aphids.
      Planting couch grass in a field of barley would clearly not be popular
      with farmers, but an allelopathic compound has been extracted from the
      couch grass that could potentially be of use.</p>
      
      <h4>Discussion</h4>
      
      <ul>
        <li>Legume intercropping can be mechanised and
          therefore carried out on a large scale. Clover may be a successful
          intercrop because it produces olfactory confusion in insects. Other
          issues that may be important as a potential pest attractant or
          deterrent are the colour of the crop or its arrangement.</li>
      </ul>
      
      <ul>
        <li>The Kenyan push-pull system is in operation in
          parts of Kenya and in Uganda, Malawi and Ethiopia. The system has
          recently come to the attention of DFID but it is relatively hard to
          promote. Such a scheme may have geographical limitations, for example,
          in South Africa maize tends to be grown at lower densities and
          therefore cover crops are less effective.</li>
      </ul>
      
      <ul>
        <li>It is unfortunate that monocultures are used in
          the UK when intercrops are so successful at creating confusion in
          pests. There is a strong pressure to grow monocultures because of the
          need to market identifiable varieties of crops. Millers and maltsters
          need single varieties. The difficulty with undercropping is that it
          could delay the harvesting time of the main crop, which is
          unacceptable because the next year's main crop needs to be planted
          quickly.</li>
      </ul>
      
      <ul>
        <li>It might be possible to produce a crop variety
          which is uniform in size but with a mixture of different receptor
          proteins for the plant to recognise pests. This would create diversity
          in just one component of the system and would use genetics and
          chemistry to make the plant more resistant to pests.</li>
      </ul>
      
      <ul>
        <li>The main quality required by growers is
          predictability. If several varieties were grown together they would
          need to have identical qualities in order to satisfy the market.</li>
      </ul>
      
      <ul>
        <li>There is an issue about delivering what the
          consumer wants. It is easier to manipulate processes in industry than
          to modify plants genetically.</li>
      </ul>
      
      <ul>

      <li>There may be problems of scaling up small field
        experiments. For push-pull systems the field size needs to be kept
        relatively small.</li>
      </ul>
      
      <ul>
        <li>Push- pull systems are a benign technology from a
          human health perspective. However such systems could have a large
          environmental impact on higher trophic levels and landscape effects if
          they encouraged the survival of certain parasitoids and
          hyperparasitoids. Any pressure that reduces the fecundity of an
          organism will create an evolutionary response, similar to the effect
          of using an insecticide.</li>

      <h3>OPTIMISING THE USE OF INSECTICIDES</h3>
      <h4>Graham Matthews (International
      Pesticide Application Research Centre, Silwood Park, UK)</h4>

      
      <p>The benefits of correct pesticide <i>application</i>
      often tend to be forgotten and relatively little money is invested in
      this. Although pesticides are very effective, they can be very
      inefficient. For example, if a crop of beans is being sprayed to control
      aphids, only 0.02% of the active ingredient applied to the crop may arrive
      at or near an aphid- there is clearly much room for improvement of the
      application process.</p>
      
      <p>From the early days of fungicide
      application at the turn of the last century, sprays have been applied
      using hydraulic nozzles, which tend to produce sprays of different droplet
      sizes. Some of these contribute to concerns about spray drift, especially
      small droplets. Ultra low-volume application was the first attempt to try
      a different application technique from conventional hydraulic nozzles. A
      newer technique is controlled droplet application (CDA), which uses rotary
      atomisation to give a more uniform droplet size. This has developed in
      certain niche markets. It is possible to use oil-based formulations but
      the use of water is a more recent trend. Using CDA, the volume of water
      needed to formulate the spray has been reduced; for example only 10-20
      litres of water are required per hectare instead of more than 200 needed
      through a hydraulic nozzle. This kind of new technology is good for weed
      management in urban areas, where people prefer not to carry large weights
      of chemical sprays on their back.</p>
      
      <p>Currently in the UK most boom
      sprayers still use conventional nozzles. More recent developments are
      aimed at better herbicide application rather than insecticide application.
      The aim has been to alter the design to produce larger droplets. In the
      most popular nozzles (the air inclusion nozzle) as the liquid comes
      through them, air is sucked in, which produces aerated droplets of spray
      that are less likely to drift. However this technique still produces a
      wide droplet size spectrum.</p>
      
      <p>A 1985 report of the committee of
      the British Crop Protection Council calculated the distribution of droplet
      size from various types of hydraulic nozzle sprays, by putting them
      through a laser beam. Categories of droplet size were calculated, from
      &quot;very fine&quot; to &quot;very coarse&quot;. Very fine sprays are not
      recommended (except, perhaps, in enclosed areas like greenhouses) due to
      the risk of spray drift. &quot;Fine&quot; sprays are ideally the best for
      distribution of insecticides throughout a crop but this must be balanced
      against the increased potential for spray drift.</p>
      
      <p>Environmentalists are concerned
      about so-called &quot;exodrift&quot; i.e. spray that leaves the field.
      When chemicals are applied to the crop, in most cases an unsprayed buffer
      zone must be left round the crop to protect the ditch or watercourse
      downwind of the spray. In the UK, because the wind changes direction so
      regularly, in practice this means every edge of the crop. For arable crops
      the measure is 5m from the edge of the crop to the top of the ditch.
      Farmers have objected to having such a wide barrier all round the field so
      the government introduced LERAP (the Local Environmental Risk Assessment
      for Pesticides). This can enable the farmer to spray closer to the field
      margins under appropriate conditions.</p>
      
      <p>In the UK, a pesticide application
      method that is favoured is the &quot;air sleeve&quot; system. It uses a
      large fan to create an airstream that is projected through a plastic
      sleeve. This produces an air curtain, which blows open the crop and allows
      good penetration of the spray into it. This reduces the incidence of
      exodrift. Another potential new development is the use of a small airjet
      to affect the spray from each nozzle. This air means that relatively
      smaller droplets are produced, but as they are carried in the airstream
      they are less likely to drift. Less air is required than for the air
      sleeve system and the other advantage is that each jet can be moved into
      an appropriate position, depending on the type of crop treated. Therefore
      this system gives more scope for adaptation.</p>
      
      <p>In orchards, the buffer zones in the
      UK are normally set at around 18m, but using LERAP for orchards this can
      be reduced to 7m. Lateral spraying into a tree rather than vertical
      spraying is better for fruit trees as it reduces drift. Another
      environmentally beneficial option for fruit crops such as grapes is a
      tunnel sprayer, where spray goes into and all around the canopy and any
      residue is collected at the base. However, such systems are very expensive
      and they are only suitable for flat ground with single rows of relatively
      small trees.</p>
      
      <p>One of the conflicting issues when
      spraying is to kill pests but also to minimize the effect on natural
      enemies. If a high volume of spray is used there is also the risk of
      considerable runoff to the ground (endo-drift). Surplus spray kills
      beneficial insects in soil and wastes money. In order to improve on this,
      more information is needed about dose-response dynamics. For example, a
      farmer may be willing to accept 70% control of a pest, provided the
      natural enemies of the pest survive to aid in pest control.</p>
      
      <p>A number of new techniques have been
      developed using conventional water-based sprays. Most of this research
      work has been carried out on herbicides rather than pesticides. Electronic
      mapping systems (e.g. GPS) have been developed for use within the crop to
      map where the pest is. Patch spraying of the affected areas only, by
      switching certain spray nozzles on or off, can then be used. GPS can also
      be used to improve the distribution of foliar fertilisers, by mapping
      areas of the crop that need fertilising.</p>
      
      <p>Pest behaviour is another important
      factor when considering spray application. Leaf hoppers are exposed on the
      upper leaf surface, other pests may be found under the leaf, whereas stem
      borers burrow into the plant. Different formulations may be needed,
      depending on whether they must stay as a discrete deposit on the plant
      surface or spread and penetrate into the plant with systemic action. Crops
      also need to be carefully monitored to time spray applications against the
      most susceptible stage of a pest.</p>
      
      <p>An effective technique for
      bollworms, which are found low down in the crop canopy, is the use of a
      &quot;tail boom&quot; or &quot;drop-leg&quot; on tractor-mounted
      equipment. This improves coverage on the lower crop canopy and effectively
      controls first instar bollworms before they started to damage the crop.
      This technique therefore requires considerably less chemical compared to
      delivery via aerial spraying. In the UK context underleaf cover on
      brassicas, potatoes etc is important as pests are often hidden within crop
      canopy.</p>
      
      <p>Control Flow valves (CFV) behind
      spray nozzles ensure uniform pressure and output on manually operated
      equipment.</p>
      
      <p>A recent Californian development has
      been to control electronically the position of each nozzle across a boom
      to spray just a row crop and not an inter-row. This may be an effective
      way of preserving natural enemies in the inter-row. Also, instead of
      spraying straight down on a crop, it is possible to spray forwards and
      backwards over it using a twin nozzle to get better penetration.</p>
      
      <p>Seed treatment with pesticides prior
      to sowing can be considered a good way of localising treatment, especially
      for early season pest management, but this method obviously has to be used
      prophylactically, rather than as a reaction to a pest outbreak.</p>
      
      <p>&quot;Lure and kill&quot; is another
      effective method i.e. persuading the pest to come into contact with the
      pesticide. For example, bednets with pyrethroid insecticides are an
      effective control of malarial mosquitoes. The humans sleeping under the
      nets are the lure. &quot;Boll weevil sticks&quot; contain an attractant
      and an insecticide- they capture weevils emerging from diapause in the
      spring before they enter the cotton fields.</p>
      
      <p>Another important issue is which new
      techniques the farmer will actually accept. The use of tramlines in crops
      for spray application was accepted very quickly after the bad aphid season
      of 1976 when there were not enough planes available to spray every field
      from the air.</p>
      
      <p>In England, farmers are required to
      pass a proficiency test, so the standard of spray application has
      increased considerably.</p>
      
      <p>There has been a great deal of
      research by agricultural engineers to develop new equipment. A lot of work
      is also done by agrochemical companies to develop improved formulations of
      pesticide. In the final analysis there will always be a trade-off between
      the biological effect and economic cost. The link between these is not
      often as good as it should be-unfortunately many sprays are tested in
      small plots using hand carried machines, which are not a realistic model
      of field conditions.</p>
      
      <p>In the future it will be important
      to consider methods of reducing application rates but still maintaining
      effective pest control.</p>
      
      <h4>Discussion</h4>
      
      <ul>
        <li>The emphasis should be to develop integrated crop
          management, with judicious use of pesticides in conjunction with
          cultural and biological tactics. However industry tends to sell
          complete chemical packages. Therefore the opportunities to promote
          biologically-based control techniques have been lost. The advent of GM
          technology is also reducing the emphasis on biocontrol.</li>
      </ul>
      
      <ul>
        <li>The lack of understanding about droplet behaviour
          and nozzle characteristics is critical. In the star rating of nozzles
          as a result of LERAP there are some problems, with the emphasis on
          reducing drift rather than optimisation of the spray within the field.
          It is important to try to reduce both the volume rate of application
          and the actual dose.</li>
        <li>Current delivery attempts appear to have been to
          control exodrift at the expense of endodrift. There are technical
          solutions available for these problems (e.g. spinning disc technology)
          but there is very little adoption of such technologies. Equally, use
          of a flat fan nozzle isn't the most suitable technique for getting
          insecticides in a crop. In certain crops, a hollow cone nozzle is
          better for creating the required droplet size. But the use of hollow
          cone nozzles with the air curtain technique has not been promoted.
          Farmers are not using the best technology available.</li>
      </ul>
      
      <ul>
        <li>The flat fan nozzle has been in existence,
          virtually unchanged for 50 years. All pesticide developments are based
          on this, but new nozzles are being introduced. There is a need to
          relate existing advice to new technology.</li>
      </ul>
      
      <ul>
        <li>Millions of pounds are spent on developing
          recommended doses for pesticides, but these are normally significantly
          reduced in actual application. Very few products are applied in the UK
          at the recommended dose. Farmers and crop consultants become more
          experimental themselves and may use 60-70% of the recommended dose or
          less.</li>
      </ul>
      
      <ul>
        <li>It would be interesting to model the theoretical
          minimum application of a pesticide needed if best practice was used.
          While only 0.6% of an applied spray reaches the insect, the target is
          realistically the plant which collects 30-40% or even up to 70% of the
          spray on the foliage.</li>
      </ul>
      
      <ul>
        <li>A greater knowledge of the physics of droplet
          transport is needed and information about how the target organism
          receives it, plus information about the bioavailablity of the spray
          over the hours and days following application. This research combines
          the disciplines of engineering, physics, meteorology, toxicology,
          ecology and behaviour- no group has continued or completed this cycle
          of research.</li>
      </ul>
      
      <ul>
        <li>Spray delivery is a highly inefficient
          technology- companies recommend their doses based on a robust dose
          applied with one technique and effective under a range of conditions.
          Organophosphates had a 50-fold compensation factor for inefficiency.
          In pyrethroids there was a 4-fold compensation factor. Research on
          optimisation of application is sorely needed.</li>
      </ul>
      
      <ul>
        <li>Chemicals manufacturers and spray delivery
          manufacturers are different companies. This produces problems of
          communication between the two groups and makes the issue confusing and
          frustrating for the regulator. Data from the two sources is never
          linked together.</li>
      </ul>
      

      <ul>
        <li>CPD for sprayer operators and sprayer testing
          will be of future benefit. The issue of buffer zones and LERAPS as
          well as equipment choice is currently being addressed in a more
          focused way.</li>
      </ul>
      
      <ul>
        <li>To determine optimum spraying and how to deliver
          it is not something the science community is looking at because the
          skills to do this have disappeared.<b></li>

      <h3>IMPACT OF PEST CONTROL MEASURES ON
      THE ENVIRONMENT</h3>
      <h4>Paul Jepson (Integrated Plant
      Protection Centre, Oregon State University, USA)</h4>
      
      <p>There is much pressure and
      controversy at present, particularly in the US, between groups that
      maintain intensive agriculture is not very damaging to the environment and
      environmentalists who maintain it is hugely and universally damaging.
      Neither view is correct. A much more educated approach is needed to the
      development and use of insecticides.</p>
      
      <p>There are many ways in which
      pesticides can enter the environmental system. Pesticide contamination of
      freshwater and groundwater is quite common. Contamination patterns are
      complex- there can be noticeable pulses of arrival of pesticides into
      water through the season that correlate with spraying and climatic events,
      especially rainfall. In Oregon there are concerns about the effects of
      these pesticide pulses on behaviour of salmon, and normal development of
      frogs and amphibians.</p>
      
      <p>Laboratory testing of pesticide
      pollutant effects tend to be carried out using <i>Daphnia</i>, a species
      that doesn't occur very widely in freshwater ecosystems like those in
      Oregon. This means there is a question about whether or not such tests
      using individual standardised organisms are ecologically relevant. Testing
      with multiple, locally collected species enables results to be
      ecologically relevant, and for the estimation of hazardous concentrations.</p>
      
      <p>With terrestrial invertebrates, it
      is also possible to carry out field measurements to detect the direct
      exposure to sprays of beneficial insects. For example, this can be done by
      adding a fluorescent marker to the spray and collecting insects to
      determine if they have been dyed. In estimating the impacts of spray
      drift, for example on Lepidoptera in field margins, if the potential dose
      of exposure of foliage with a single spray is known, it is possible to use
      laboratory-collected dose-response data to estimate impacts. Thus, good
      predictions can be made into the toxicity on non-target organisms, but
      unfortunately these techniques are not often used.</p>
      
      <p>Long-term effects in the field are
      not closely correlated with laboratory obtained measures of toxicological
      susceptibility. Carabid beetles can be badly affected by only a few sprays
      but this is not seen in the short-term, only in large scale, multifield
      experiments. However, even with a supertoxic material that kills 100% of
      beetles each time it was applied, simple models tell us that it would be
      necessary to spray 50% of a farm before exceeding a 50% likelihood of
      carabid beetle extinction, due to the dispersal rate and mobility of the
      organisms.</p>
      
      <p>A great deal is known about the
      impacts of pesticides on non-target organisms but these techniques are not
      widely applied in simple tests of how toxic different practices are and
      more of these types of data are needed.</p>
      
      <h4>Large spatial and temporal scales</h4>
      
      <p>In the Netherlands, some carabid
      ground beetles have been studied for 120 years and there has not been any
      apparent effect of modern agriculture. However local extinctions can occur
      at the farm scale with over-reliance on pesticides.</p>
      
      <p>It is not possible successfully to
      extrapolate from the small scale upwards or from large scale downwards.
      Equally, long-term data on ecological impacts will never be available for
      more than a few organisms in more than a few habitats, but there are large
      datasets available from regulatory packages that show the impacts of
      pesticides on non-target organisms. Some of these data sets can be used to
      predict effects on other similar organisms in similar systems.</p>
      
      <h4>Pesticide decay profiles</h4>
      
      <p>In ecotoxicological studies, the aim
      is to establish if the Predicted Environmental Concentration (PEC) of a
      pesticide is greater than the concentration predicted to have no effect.
      One factor to take into consideration is that pesticides are transient
      because they will decay over time.</p>
      
      <p>The Ecotoxicological Recovery Time (ERT)
      for any particular pesticide is the time following application that the
      residual dose subsides to the &quot;95% protection level&quot; for the
      community (e.g. soil invertebrates). This is the point at which,
      theoretically, 95% of exposed insects will be unaffected by the pesticide
      dose, and it is argued that general population recovery can take place
      after this point. . It is possible to examine the decay profile for a
      number of pesticides and calculate the ERT . For Dimethoate the ERT is
      0.15 years, for Benomyl it is 3.8 years i.e. general population recovery
      for soil invertebrates will only take place following the ERT . Pesticides
      can be ranked according to a joint assessment of their toxicity and their
      persistence, and this improves our ability to predict responses in the
      field. .</p>
      
      <p>The focus of attention tends to be
      on the effects of acute toxicity, but there is much less understanding of
      the profile of decay of chemicals and long-term effects. The use of
      organophosphates was never optimised as there was no understanding of how
      to use them properly. This was very unfortunate because of the large scope
      of properties of these chemicals, such that one well-timed spray in a
      season could be extremely effective.</p>
      
      <h4>Modelling of stream insects and
      their response to pesticides</h4>
      
      <p>Aquatic insects are a ubiquitous
      part of the aquatic environment and have an important role in nutrient
      cycling. Species have been selected for research on the basis of their
      abundance and life history. Stoneflies (predators), mayflies (herbivores)
      and caddis flies (detritivore species) have been tested. Profiles of
      toxicological impacts have been generated using bioassays to determine
      hazardous concentrations to the community.</p>
      
      <p>Most bioassays are based on
      super-exposure and effects are therefore much higher than would occur at
      the actual rate of exposure that would normally be encountered. There is a
      need to vary the exposure time and consider pulsed exposure. There is a
      clear trade-off between concentration, exposure time of the organism and
      toxicity. There is also a vital need to understand the impact of direct
      and indirect effects at the community level.</p>
      
      <p>Paul Jepson has worked with Zeneca
      Agrochemicals, Pond Action at Oxford Brookes University and other
      University researchers, to develop a web-based approach to link pesticide
      fate in ponds with toxicology and invertebrate life history. It is
      possible to generate a recovery model for sample populations and vary
      factors such as population size, growth rate and immigration rate of new
      organisms.</p>
      
      <p>Donald Baird at the Institute of
      Aquaculture in Stirling, and others, have recently examined data
      concerning the effects of chlorpyriphos contamination of drainage ditches
      on invertebrate communities in the Netherlands. It was a community-based
      approach examining functional feeding groups: primary producers,
      herbivores, predators and detritivores. Levels of nutrients and pesticides
      were manipulated in the system. Nutrient manipulation boosted primary
      production and increased the numbers of herbivores and carnivores.
      Addition of pesticides killed certain herbivores, which led to higher
      standing crops of some of the primary producers and caused both direct and
      indirect effects on the predators. The data were examined in terms of
      impacts on the whole community. This is an exciting piece of work and
      shows that the future direction of research should now be to pursue a more
      community-based approach to understanding pesticide impacts in
      agroecosystems.</p>
      
      <h4>Transgenic agriculture</h4>
      
      <p>The exposure pathways of insects to
      plant incorporated protectants (PIPs) is very different to the exposure
      pathways to pesticides in conventional crops. Some taxa of beneficial
      organisms are clearly not exposed to PIP's and therefore will not be
      affected- this is a difficult message to convey to the sceptical public.
      In contrast, some beneficial taxa will be exposed to the PIP toxin for the
      whole season because a pathway of exposure exists. Use of PIP's is
      arguably a very inefficient way of administrating pesticides. Impacts of
      large scale adoption of GM crops may be extreme for exposed and affected
      taxa, and the challenge is to identify how numerous these organisms are,
      and to determine the significance of impacts relative to conventional
      pesticides and alternative methods of pest control.</p>
      
      <p>Indirect effects may be more
      important than direct effects, for example specialist assemblages of
      parasitoids can be reduced by indirect effects following reduction of
      target pest populations. Selection of suitable taxa for monitoring is a
      far more complex problem than for conventional pesticides. In the US there
      has been a recent extension by the EPA of the registration of Bt corn and
      Bt cotton, and the need for more field-derived census data and
      toxicological testing has been recognised. There will now be long-term
      monarch butterfly and avian studies.</p>
      
      <p>Unpublished data by Graham Head <i>et
      al</i>. showed that abundance of predatory bugs is higher in Bt cotton
      than in conventional cotton, because they escape pesticide sprays. Spiders
      also have higher survival rates for the same reason. However, more
      ladybirds are found in conventional sprayed cotton than in Bt cotton
      because aphid attacks are more common in the former.</p>
      
      <p>In a study of Australian
      pest-tolerant cotton in 1998-1999, Bt cotton received 10 sprays per year,
      as opposed to 18 sprays on conventional cotton i.e. the Bt cotton was
      still receiving a considerable amount of spray treatment. There may be
      ways of growing cotton that are far superior in helping beneficial
      insects.</p>
      
      <h4>Additional modelling approaches</h4>
      
      <p>Chris Topping (formerly of The
      Glasshouse Crops Research Institute, Sussex, but now based in Denmark)
      uses a Geographical information System (GIS) to compare survival of
      non-target organisms in different agricultural landscapes, using a model
      called ALMaSS. He models distribution of nest sites for skylarks in
      imaginary and real agricultural landscapes with different amounts of
      insecticide use. This is a unique approach and is gaining significant
      interest from the pesticide industry and regulatory agencies.</p>
      
      <p>In Oregon, researchers are examining
      future changes in the agro-environment using new ways of modelling
      agricultural landscapes and watersheds. One group at the University of
      Oregon is modelling land-use planning over the next 20 years. It is
      addressing questions such as &quot;what will the future landscape look
      like if there is a great emphasis on conservation, or conversely, on
      urbanisation?&quot; Predicted landscape changes if urbanisation is given
      priority would be a loss of old-growth timber in the area as well as a
      reduction in water quality.</p>
      
      <p>Paul Jepson and John Bolte are
      examining what happens when the priorities of people who live in a
      watershed are also considered. Such stakeholder objectives may include
      water quality, water quantity, habitat quality and social and aesthetic
      issues. The approach in this study is to work with stakeholders to assess
      their objectives and to measure the impacts of different practices by
      investigating factors including hydrology, stream temperature, sediment
      transport, habitat quality, biodiversity, landscape costs, and social
      goals. These factors are then modelled in a spatially-explicit landscape
      generator. The stakeholder can vary the priority they assign to different
      factors and the model predicts how the landscape will change according to
      the different order of these priorities.</p>
      
      <p>The two new concepts of producing
      models with a biological approach to predicting pesticide fate into ground
      and surface waters, as well as models that provide tools for stakeholders
      will be powerful future research tools.</p>
      
      <h4>Conclusions</h4>
      
      <p>Pesticides have impacts that need to
      be mitigated. Some compounds clearly have intrinsically higher impacts
      than others. However, the influence of other anthropogenic factors is also
      vitally important.</p>
      
      <p>There is a need to move beyond
      merely describing effects (i.e. explaining how toxic pesticides are) and
      to move towards management and mitigation of these effects. More
      comprehensive and dynamic landscape models will be required to achieve
      this.</p>
      
      <p>It is necessary to return to an era
      where farm biodiversity is monitored and experimental regimes developed
      that examine the functional role of agrobiodiversity.</p>
      
      <p>Scientists are often appointed into
      biocide development groups and agroecosystem management without the
      benefit of ecological training- this should change.</p>
      
      <h4>Discussion</h4>
      
      <ul>
        <li>In the UK in 2003 there may be risks increased
          impacts on some beneficial insects when certain types of pesticide
          become restricted and more toxic or less efficient alternatives take
          their place. The impact will depend very much on the pesticide group
          involved. If growers are given less choice, an unintended consequence
          is that they may use more toxic chemicals on a larger scale. Mildly
          toxic effects on a large scale can be just as harmful as acute
          toxicity at a small scale- this is clear to ecologists but has not
          been acknowledged by the pesticide regulatory sector.</li>
      </ul>
      
      <ul>
        <li>It may be possible to develop more benign
          pesticides, but there is concern that many of these new products (e.g.
          Bt sprays to control Lepidoptera) will be used more frequently because
          spray application and delivery techniques have not been well
          developed. Diversity in the market place is important as it allows
          people to make educated decisions about which spray to use most
          effectively.</li>
      </ul>
      
      <ul>
        <li>Regulatory decisions are based on short-term and
          small-scale studies. In the US in particular there has been a
          regression to single-species testing that only provides information
          about the intrinsic toxicity of a compound - this has meant a backward
          step of around 50 years in terms of the quality of the data considered
          in the regulatory decision. Much is known about the toxicity of a
          compound but very little about its effects in the field.</li>
      </ul>
      
      <ul>
        <li>It is important, however that regulators and
          growers should have separate domains. Regulators shouldn't interfere
          once the decision to pass pesticides has been made as this can cause
          many problems.</li>
      </ul>
      
      <ul>
        <li>In the UK and Europe a major pollution concern is
          not the spraying process itself but the cleaning of spray tanks and
          other sources of contamination. There are new regulations that direct
          the farmer to use clean water to flush out the spray tank during the
          final spraying. This avoids the tank being washed out in the farmyard
          and the chemical washing into drains. Research in Germany indicated
          that 80% of the stream contamination in some orchard areas was as a
          result of washing the tanks and not due to spray drift. The most
          seriously contaminated watersheds in America are in urban areas. This
          is a reminder that pesticide use is not just by growers; the worst
          examples of contamination are in areas they are not responsible for.</li>
      </ul>
      
      <ul>
        <li>Modelling at a landscape scale is an appealing
          idea, although there is a great danger of the compounding of errors
          due to the complexity of the parameters included. An additional
          difficulty is that most land is privately owned so private
          decision-making processes occur at microscales when the aim is to
          model at macroscales. This may be mitigated by programmes that
          encourage growers to collaborate such as the ESA (Environmentally
          Sensitive Area) schemes.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>HUMAN HEALTH ISSUES AND REGULATORY
      IMPLICATIONS</h3>
      <h4>Terry Tooby (JSC International Ltd,
      UK)</h4>
      
      <p>Human health issues are responsible
      for some of the pressures driving the decision-making process about
      pesticide use. In trying to establish risks of pesticides to human health
      it is necessary to use animal testing and to extrapolate to humans. There
      are accepted practices but this whole system of testing is based on many
      assumptions. In order to determine the impact of pesticides on the nation's
      health, there is the need for a more holistic view. This will be achieved
      by bringing together people from different sectors and discussing what the
      primary objectives for the future ought to be.</p>
      
      <p>The concept of &quot;Human
      health&quot; includes: mental and social well-being, lifestyle factors,
      environmental factors and the absence of disease or infirmity. The
      importance of agriculture in human health will depend on issues such as
      whether UK residents obtain most of their food from the UK or from
      elsewhere and also the relative proportion of fresh or processed food
      eaten. There is a considerable problem of communication, with many members
      of the public viewing the countryside as a &quot;theme park&quot; and
      supermarkets as their primary source of food. This is partly because
      consumers don't buy directly from farmers.</p>
      
      <p>A white paper was recently published
      on food safety by the EU (final draft in 2000). This paper was prompted by
      the BSE and <i>E. coli</i> scares, plus the problems of food residues. As
      a result of this paper, the EU has established a new body, the European
      Food Standards Agency (EFSA), which will be responsible for pesticides and
      food residues.</p>
      
      <p>It is clear that consumer issues are
      now driving the controls of pesticides. In the UK, the report of the
      policy commission on the future of farming and food says the public are
      becoming increasingly concerned about the food they eat. People are
      concerned about:</p>
      
      <ul>
        <li>Use of pesticides and fertilisers</li>
        <li>Animal welfare</li>
        <li>Feeding practices</li>
        <li>Use of antibiotics</li>
      </ul>
      
      <p>This report says that England's
      food and farming industry today is unsustainable in every sense of the
      term. This thinking will dictate and overlie many of the future decisions
      on pesticide usage and decisions.</p>
      
      <p>The report said about pesticides:</p>
      
      <ul>
        <li>The risk from pesticide use must be reduced.</li>
        <li>There was a need to disseminate information on
          integrated farm management and organic farming.</li>
        <li>There is concern about the damage that the past
          use of pesticides has had on the environment (especially
          organochlorines and organophosphates) and that members of the public
          are concerned about the harmful effect these may still have.</li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>The report conceded that the majority of our food
          will continue to be grown with the help of pesticides for the
          foreseeable future and that the regulatory system in the UK is good.</li>
        <li>It is important to try to minimise the negative
          consequences arising from the use of pesticides.</li>
      </ul>
      
      <p>There were 823 active substances
      available on the market in 1993; now after a European review this has been
      reduced to around 240. Many of these chemicals were not supported by
      residue or environmental data. No reason is given for withdrawing an
      active substance- it may not be unsafe, just uneconomic. This can be
      misconstrued, adding to the concern the public already has.</p>
      
      <h4>Human health issues</h4>
      <p>There are potential risks to both
      the operator applying the pesticide to a crop and to the end consumer of
      the crop. For the operator, the majority of contamination occurs through
      handling the concentrated product, during mixing and loading procedures.
      There is also exposure during spraying. In the UK it is possible to ask
      the operator to wear protective clothing- this is not true for all areas
      of Europe.</p>
      
      <p>Regulators use the most extreme case
      on which to base the rules e.g. they assume that an operator will be
      spraying without using a tractor cab or without protective clothing. This
      then becomes the model on which regulation is based. Workers may re-enter
      a treated crop and bystanders do not wear protective clothing. Exposure
      may be a critical problem, especially in enclosed areas like glasshouses.</p>
      
      <p>For the consumer, it is important to
      remember the different categories of adults, children, toddlers and
      infants, all of who may potentially suffer different risks, either acute
      or long-term.</p>
      
      <p>EU regulation, establishing the EFSA,
      includes more than just pesticides; it covers animal feed, novel food and
      GMOs as well as issues of contamination and residues. There are many added
      complications, such as the fact that many insecticides are used on stored
      products. There are also the impacts on water. Europe has determined that
      no pesticide should be found to exceed &gt;0.1&#956;gl<sup>-1</sup> in
      drinking water, regardless of toxicity of the particular pesticide. There
      has been a global review of the data supporting existing chemicals but it
      is a very large problem to do this. Certain countries started national
      review programmes and this prompted the EU to also begin to implement a
      review.</p>
      
      <h4>Global Crop Protection Market</h4>
      <p>It is important to remember that as
      well as food standard agencies and consumer issues, an additional factor
      is the decline in the number of major crop protection companies through
      amalgamation. Re-registration procedures are likely to severely limit the
      number of available pesticides. There is a concern that with the rush to
      review and withdraw, driven by numbers only there may be a loss of
      significant biological activity in the &quot;armoury&quot;.</p>
      
      
      
      
      <p>Of the 190 insecticides currently
      being reviewed in the EU:</p>
      <p>93 are under evaluation (and this
      evaluation may take years)</p>
      <p>94 have already been withdrawn
      (mostly due to economic, rather than safety problems)</p>
      <p>2 have been listed in Annexe 1</p>
      <p>These are worrying figures.</p>
      
      <h4>Assessment of risk</h4>
      <p>Potential human health risks from
      pesticides are established using rats and mice and the data are
      extrapolated to humans. Risk is calculated as the hazard multiplied by the
      exposure. This procedure needs refining and there is a need to
      characterise what &quot;risk&quot; really is. The same chemical can have
      very different risks depending on how and when it is applied. For example,
      modifying methods of application could mean that a chemical that would
      otherwise be withdrawn due to operator risk could be rendered safe to use.</p>
      
      <p>Risk management uses a
      nationally-based system and worst-case scenarios. There is significant
      room to improve this. Schemes such as LERAPs have begun to address this
      type of problem but there is a need for substantial local assessment. All
      aspects of risk need to be communicated to consumers. A typical dilemma
      might be whether to ban an organochlorine pesticide or to tell consumers
      to change their food preparation method to make the crop safe to eat.</p>
      
      <h4>Risk characterisation</h4>
      <p>For the operator, the measurement of
      risk is the Acceptable Operator Exposure Level (AOEL). For the consumer,
      the measurement of risk is the Acceptable Daily Intake (ADI). It has been
      recognised that some insecticides including organophosphates and
      pyrethroids have the potential for acute effects, so another measure of
      risk is used - the Acute Reference Dose (ARD).</p>
      
      <p>Information is currently obtained
      from acute toxicity data by an LD50 test on rats. There is hence a need
      for good quality sub-chronic studies to examine short-term impacts. Tests
      on potential developmental or teratology impacts on humans are also based
      on animal studies. If effects are found in more than one species, the
      safety margin for human exposure would be increased. It is also important
      that tests should also be carried out using several generations of
      laboratory animal. For tests on the risk of carcinogenicity, rodents are
      used as models but are known to suffer spontaneous tumours, which makes it
      difficult to assess the likelihood of effect on humans. If tumours were
      found to occur in many different species as a result of exposure to a
      pesticide it would indicate a much more likely problem for humans.</p>
      
      <p>There is a need for a better
      understanding of metabolic processes and also to obtain data by studying
      humans who have suffered pesticide poisoning. There is also the need for
      better information on pesticide degradation routes and rates. It is vital
      to understand how the pesticide residues behave in the crop and whether
      its metabolites will be significant to health.</p>
      
      <h4>Routes of uptake</h4>
      <p>The operator risk (AOEL) is based on
      inhalation or dermal or oral exposure, although dermal exposure is the
      most likely to be a problem. In contrast, the consumer risk is oral,
      through food consumption. In order to assess the risk of pesticide
      exposure by consumption, the Theoretical Maximum Daily Intake (TMDI) is
      calculated. This figure will be an overestimate, assuming maximum rate of
      consumption of food with a maximum residue level and assuming no pesticide
      degradation. The TMDI needs to be estimated for the four key consumer
      groups: adults, children, toddlers and infants. Two components of diet are
      used- the national estimated daily intake and national estimates of
      short-term intake (to assess acute impacts).</p>
      
      <p>In order to control the residues in
      food crops it is necessary to establish Maximum Residue Levels (MRLs).
      These are used as the legal requirement for food to be acceptable, and is
      therefore effectively the trading standard for both UK and imported food.
      However, most consumers assume these levels are toxicologically
      significant, when in fact they are not.</p>
      
      <p>Another issue is the different ways
      in which food is eaten. Processed foods and stored products typically
      combine a large number of plant products from within one crop (or even
      from different crops from different countries). This gives a large safety
      margin over potential residues because of the likely mixture of the
      original sources of the food. A much greater problem is with single
      vegetables and fruits, where there is potentially huge variation between
      residue levels in individuals items and they are eaten individually. A
      single carrot or apple could hence exceed the Acute Reference Dose or
      Acceptable Daily Intake. For this reason, pressures from consumers also
      tend to concentrate here.</p>
      
      <p>Hence there are issues of
      variability that must be taken into consideration. It is difficult to
      characterise the risk from such exposure. One of the ways forward is to
      examine risk from the point of view of probability. Monte Carlo assessment
      can be used to determine the chances of any individual taking two
      consecutive high residue components in their diet.</p>
      
      <h4>Isomers</h4>
      <p>Some pesticide compounds may include
      isomers and unless the metabolism and rates of degradation of each isomer
      is known, the regulators will only take the worst case scenario into
      consideration. If it is possible to separate out the biologically
      significant isomer it may reduce the rate of pesticide application.</p>
      
      <p>Unfortunately, for some compounds
      isomers cannot be cost-effectively separated. Additionally, some isomers
      are differentially degraded between their target (insects) and mammals. Or
      they may be differentially degraded in both rodents and humans so a rodent
      model can't be used to assess likely impacts on humans. The regulatory
      implications mean that an ADI and ARD are based on the worst case
      scenario.</p>
      
      <p>To conclude, there is a need to
      bring a much greater understanding of the exposure of both the operator
      and consumer to pesticides into risk assessment. Unless this is done, the
      default regulatory decision about any pesticide may be to withdraw it
      because there will be no data to support safe use.</p>
      
     
      <h4>Discussion</h4>
      <ul>
      <li>Ordinary food contains many potentially dangerous
        chemicals. There are 10,000 carcinogenic natural pesticides in plants
        and each person consumes several grams worth every day, but residue from
        a synthetic pesticide provides only 1/20,000 of this total. Current
        concern about pesticide residues is about a relatively insignificant
        issue. Food is regarded as though it is pristine to begin with, then
        farmers add health harming chemicals to it. Food itself may have
        intrinsically unpleasant properties. It is possible that genetic
        modification can remove some of these unwanted characteristics.</li>
      </ul>
      
      <ul>
        <li>High doses of pesticides need to be given to
          experimental animals to demonstrate toxic effect in order to estimate
          a high margin of safety in humans. The population does not share this
          understanding- they see a dangerous problem, whatever the dose
          concerned. The communication of the concept of risk is an important
          issue. Consumers need the information to make their own choices and
          they need to know the levels of uncertainty involved when information
          is presented to them. At the level of the individual there is always
          the risk that a particular person will be prone to effects from a
          pesticide residue.</li>
      </ul>
      
      <ul>
        <li>Figures from the Food Standards Agency put the
          risks from pesticide residues into context. It lists the number of
          premature deaths in per year in the UK due to diet-related factors:
          35, 000 cancers are due to poor diet, 80, 000 circulation deaths are
          due to poor diet, 50 deaths by food poisoning are caused by diet,
          there have been 15 cases of CJD but there are no known deaths from
          pesticide residues. Poor diet is the major problem. If there is a risk
          from pesticide residues, it is well hidden. The problem is that people
          perceive that they have no power over issues such as pesticide
          residues and CJD and this is why it concerns them.</li>
      </ul>
      
      <ul>
        <li>There is an issue about the potential problems of
          cocktails of chemicals on human health. A recent report from the Food
          Standards Agency implies that there is not a significant cocktail
          effect between different pesticides given the current levels of
          residues. However there is the potential for residues to react with
          the 10<sup>8</sup> natural products in existence. This produces a
          problem of enormous magnitude. Regulatory systems in different
          countries seem to working effectively despite the limitations, because
          of the stringent built-in precautions. Thousands of compounds are
          rejected before they even reach the point of mammalian screening
          because they have already revealed toxic properties. The vast majority
          of screening therefore occurs within industry.</li>
      </ul>
      
      <ul>
        <li>Science and technology deliver superior
          analytical tools to which new foods are then subject. New products
          like GM foods go through more stringent testing than other foods were
          ever subjected to. There are problems with the regulatory process
          keeping up because of this. It is important to try to estimate if all
          the money spent on pesticide regulation is appropriate.</li>
      </ul>
      
      <ul>
        <li>Another issue is the impact of imported overseas
          food. Figures such as MRL levels are unobtainable in areas like Africa
          and DFID has to aid small producers in countries like Kenya because of
          EU imposed standards for food. It is recognised in Europe that as
          compounds are withdrawn from use, it effectively restricts their use
          worldwide because the EU country will not accept imported food
          containing that compound. An import tolerance level needs to be
          established for imported crops, but it is not certain who will set
          this.</li>
      </ul>
      
      <ul>
        <li>When the EU expands so that its 15 member states
          become 22, new members need to show that they are adopting the EU
          legal framework for pesticide regulation &quot;in principle&quot;.
          Countries such as Bulgaria do not have the staff to take on such
          review programmes. Therefore such countries may question existing
          procedures and thus introduce more pragmatism into the regulation
          process. At present there is a considerable Northern European bias,
          and Southern European members are not as effective at putting their
          views across. It is desirable that this should change.</li>
      </ul>
      
      <ul>
        <li>Many of the discussions in this meeting have been
          based around the use of fast-acting chemical insecticides and their
          safe use. Apart from the environmental considerations, chemical
          approaches have a built in obsolescence and resistance will occur. It
          is important also to think about imaginative alternatives and a
          diversity of approaches.</li>
      </ul>
      
      <ul>
        <li>New approaches, such as the use of
          mycoinsecticides can be hampered by the regulatory system. However, to
          move any type of potential pesticide from the laboratory into practice
          is expensive. There needs to be equivalent investment in alternative
          methods of control to that invested in chemical control.</li>
      </ul>
      
      <ul>
        <li>It was suggested that it might be helpful to find
          a term to replace Integrated Pest Management (IPM). The new term
          should convey the sense of a better use of pesticides, with more
          specific agents that are better applied. It would communicate the idea
          of promoting the better use of pesticides under appropriate
          circumstances. This could be used to address the gap in funding and
          support for this type of research. Suggested terms included:</li>
      </ul>

      <strong>
      <p>Rational pesticide use</p>
      <p>Integrated crop management</p>
      <p>Conservation agriculture</p>
      <p>Resource conserving agriculture</p>
      <p>Conservation Grade farming</p>
      </strong>
      
      <ul>
        <li>All growers use multiple pest control practices-
          rotations, timing, cultivation, choice of variety, choice of fields to
          grow crop in, i.e. there are lots of pest control practices that do
          not involve pesticides. Some of these have been forgotten during the
          pesticide generation. The use of chemicals is not incompatible with
          biodiversity, but they need to be used correctly. It is not sufficient
          to replace the paradigm of pesticides with a surrogate- such as a
          viral insecticide or GM crop. The challenge now is to exploit
          functional biodiversity more effectively and make it economically
          viable.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>FUTURE TRENDS</h3>
      <h4>Tony Trewavas (Edinburgh University)</h4>
      
      <h4>Overall summary</h4>.

	<p>
      There needs to be a conceptual change in the way the problem of pest
      control is considered. A systems approach is needed to better understand
      both the structure and sustainability of farms and how to control pest
      populations. The farmer is the key control for constructing sustainable
      agriculture.</p>
      
      <p>Some of the important drivers and
      future issues in agriculture include:</p>
      
      <ul>
        <li>The global price of wheat and rice is currently
          very poor.</li>
      </ul>
      
      <ul>
        <li>Global population is estimated to increase from 6
          billion to 8.3 billion by 2025 and to 10 billion by 2050. This will
          have a considerable impact on UK agriculture exports and trade.</li>
      </ul>
      
      <ul>
        <li>Environmental issues must be taken into account
          and incorporated into future agricultural policy.</li>
      </ul>
      
      <ul>
        <li>The taxpayer supports farming and is becoming
          concerned and aware about food production methods, animal welfare,
          GMOs and the environment.</li>
      </ul>
      
      <ul>
        <li>There may be slow removal of tariffs on imported
          food. If world agricultural trade barriers were all removed, there
          would potentially be no UK agriculture because most UK crops can be
          grown more cheaply elsewhere.</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h4>Immediate Future Directions.</h4>
      
      <p>Farms that produce basic commodities
      such as wheat will become larger - this is already occurring as companies
      take over existing small farms. Small farms will also survive, but only if
      they provide complimentary niche products such as organic food or
      neutraceuticals. A theoretical justification for the continued increase in
      numbers of large farms is already available and rests on the demonstration
      that the distribution of wealth in population is stochastic and uneven.
      Simply put, in bad times, as at present for farmers, the wealthier, larger
      farm can afford to invest more money in new crops, new technologies and
      new machinery. Investment returns are often irregular, but are
      proportional to the amount invested. The rich simply make more profit
      because they have more money to invest. Smaller farms will be taken over
      unless they can find a niche market which is complimentary and not
      competitive with big farms.</p>
      
      <p>Large farms do raise certain
      environmental concerns. The &quot;Boarded Barns&quot; study at Ongar,
      Essex compared conventional, integrated and organic farming over a period
      of 10 years. The study concluded that Integrated Farm Management was the
      best solution to the requirements of environmental and landscape demands,
      animal welfare, and the need to maintain farmer income and land use
      efficiency. This very detailed and crucial study reported that 85% of
      bio-diversity was found in hedgerows and field margins, with the type of
      crop grown in the field having a bigger impact than the mode of farming.
      Despite many measurements consistent differences in numbers of predatory
      arthropods on organic or conventional fields were not observed
      contradicting many assumptions about organic farming. Legislation may be
      needed to ensure field margin and hedgerow maintenance on large, efficient
      farms.</p>
      
      <h4>New methods in farming.</h4>
      
      <p>Newer technologies to provide both economic and
      environmental benefit are emerging.</p>
      <ul>
       
        <li> <b>Precision agriculture </b>uses
        metre-by-metre knowledge of previous yields, organic content, soil
        chemistry, structure and pest history to match sowing rate and eventual
        mineral application precisely with crop canopy expansion minimising
        waste. Continuous assessment of soil nutrients should soon be possible
        on the same basis using GM sentinels, plants that report water and
        nutrient status.</li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        
        <li><b>Conservation agriculture</b>
        commonly called <b>Integrated No-Till </b>or Minimal Till agriculture
        starts with the recognition that ploughing is the most damaging soil
        treatment. Instead crop residues are left on the soil surface
        substantially reducing erosion and direct drill is used to sow seed.
        Compared to ploughed organic or conventional fields nitrate run off is
        halved and integrated nutrient management reduces it further, improving
        water quality and reducing the expense of purification. The soil now
        becomes a carbon sink, beneficial to climate change policies. Earthworm
        and farmland bird numbers soar; bigger field margins boost bio-diversity
        enormously. Crucially, fossil fuel use is one third that of other
        farming methods on a per yield basis. New approaches to disease control
        are however necessary but the shared experience of individual farmers
        through the inter-net could create an enormous compendium of valuable
        knowledge and developing experience on disease control for No-till and
        stabilise its introduction. The use of herbicide resistant GM crops is
        the simplest way of introducing No-Till to the UK. But ill-informed
        knowledge about agriculture and lack of understanding amongst some
        members of the public leading to agitation against GM crops, may slow
        the introduction of these remarkable environmental benefits. Landscape,
        animal welfare and margin and hedgerow maintenance optimise wild life
        and bio-diversity.</li>
      </ul>
      
      <ul>
        
        <li><b>Organic agriculture </b>is
        popular with some members of the public but few farmers because the
        market is less certain. It has strict rules on animal welfare and field
        margins and an inspector system to police the use of organic
        regulations. The primary difference with conventional agriculture is the
        rejection of soluble minerals and synthetic pesticides. However the
        downside is that lower yields necessitate higher prices and land is thus
        used inefficiently. Although manures of animal origin and green
        leguminous manures are used for fertiliser, these cause pollution
        through nitrate run-off that is similar in amount to a well-managed
        conventional farm. Analyses of animal manures indicates order of
        magnitude variability in the major mineral constituents of N P K and Ca
        no doubt accounting in part for lower yields. These elements wash
        directly into the soil and are inherently no different from applying
        soluble minerals. However the organic materials decay more slowly,
        releasing further minerals for plant growth over a longer time period. A
        major problem with organic agriculture is the presence of higher
        populations of weeds that necessitate the use of the plough for control
        thus damaging the soil and releasing carbon dioxide to the atmosphere.
        Excess phosphate in manure also induces breakdown of organic material.
        Although the desire by organic supporters to improve the quality of UK
        agriculture is commendable, it must be asked whether the assumptions on
        which organic agriculture is based are credible. The Soil Association
        emphasises the necessity for maintaining the quality of the soil but
        ploughing is required because herbicides are banned. For 158 years
        winter wheat has been grown continuously here at Rothamsted Experimental
        Station UK, on soil fertilised only with minerals or only with farmyard
        manure. Identical yields have been obtained throughout that time. While
        no one would recommend continuous mono-culture cropping as a form of
        farming, the measurements indicate that greater numbers of
        micro-organisms in the soil or organic material have no direct relation
        to wheat yield or sustainability. Further measurements at Rothamsted
        have also indicated farmyard manure may cause the greatest nitrate
        pollution of waterways. In compensation organic food offers the consumer
        a lower level of pesticide residues, that is considered irrelevant to
        human health by toxicologists because the background of natural food
        pesticides is so much higher.</li>
      </ul>
      
      <p>If there are current problems with
      UK agriculture many can be identified as arising from poor management.
      Pointing out to economically-minded farmers that nitrate and pesticide
      pollution is money down the drain as it were might change attitudes.
      Should farmers be licensed to farm after demonstration of managerial
      competence or qualification much as in other professions?</p>
      
      
      <h4>Systems approaches to farms and farm
      management.</h4>
      
      <p>All living systems are constructed
      from highly inter-connected networks. Cells are constructed from numerous
      interconnected chemicals, tissues from interconnected cells and
      individuals from interconnected tissues. Populations and ecosystems are
      constructed from numerous interconnected species. The recognition of this
      systems concept as underpinning all biology and in turn human political
      and economic systems has had profound impact on understanding their
      behaviour although it has had little impact currently on farms and
      farming. Two complimentary approaches are used to investigate the
      structure and properties of systems. The <i>reductionist</i> assumption is
      that the operation of the parts determine overall systems behaviour; the <i>systems</i>
      assumption states that the structure of the whole orchestrates the
      behaviour of the parts. Systems understanding can often appear
      counter-intuitive but farmers can recognise that their farm structure
      determines how they choose their particular farming methods and crops.</p>
      
      <p>Farms are complex but purposeful
      dynamic systems that take various inputs and generate the output of food
      and farmer income. Strictly speaking only modelling can investigate the
      behaviour of such systems but numerous stochastic factors such as price
      volatility, catastrophic events, poor weather, sudden pest infestation,
      new technology, storage capacity make it difficult to model at the single
      farm level. However good farmers are intuitive systems thinkers seeing the
      essential connections between all the biological occupants of their farm.
      A good farmer appreciates that care in animal welfare leads to greater
      milk or protein yields. Good farmers use adaptive management, if necessary
      buying or selling land or even taking additional occupations as need be to
      supplement income in poor times. Farm experience and knowledge is hard
      won. Part of the farmers intuitive systems thinking encompasses seeing the
      value of maintaining margins, hedgerows that are sites for pest predators
      and some bird species to help control pests. It gives rise to the
      construction of beetle banks and other devices on integrated and organic
      farms to help control crop pests.</p>
      
      <p>Systems thinking emphasises
      hierarchy, connectance, coherence, synergy and most particularly context.
      The importance of context cannot be over emphasised. All farms are in part
      unique structures with variable soil quality on a field-by-field or even
      metre-by-metre basis, variable but very local climate, variable weed and
      pest population that is inconsistent throughout the farm. Furthermore the
      local landscape, trees and other farming and local economic activities
      interact with the farm itself. It is possible to use a sensitivity
      analysis to detect the parts of any network that are the most vulnerable
      to manipulation; good farmers intuitively know the most sensitive
      constraints that limit income and yield and inevitably vary from year to
      year. Or if they don't the good farmer experiments and learns that way, a
      process that needs encouragement.</p>
      
      <p>Stability, sustainability or
      resilience are system properties and are determined by the particular
      structure. Most investigations that have taken place have examined what
      causes the farm system to collapse and in most cases it seems to be poor
      financial management rather than poor farming that is responsible although
      the two might be inter-related. However there are two simple rule of thumb
      considerations that can be introduced.</p>
      
      <ul>
        <li>Diversity commonly makes for stability. Thus a
          farmer growing many crops instead of one is more likely to have a
          stable income; in finance diverse investments again ensure income
          stability. On this basis crop rotation helps stabilise output, use of
          multi-lines of resistant and susceptible genotypes in fields should
          help stabilise against disease and reduce fungicide use. Although it
          is often thought that greater diversity in ecosystems could make for
          stability this is contentious. Instead particular kinds of systems
          structures where organisms are complimentary to each other and where
          many organism only weakly interact with others but in which certain
          pivotal organisms are present that interact densely with many others
          seem to provide substantive stability. Such models may provide a basis
          for understanding stable farming systems countrywide.</li>
      </ul>
      
      <ul>
        <li>A second suggestion derives in part from that
          above. Attempts are being made to construct a minimal bacterial cell
          that can survive under discrete laboratory conditions. Estimates
          indicate that 3-400 genes should be sufficient. Yet most bacteria have
          3000 genes and the suggestion is that the majority of bacterial genes
          provide for control systems that enable the bacteria to grow under a
          multiplicity of different environmental conditions. In this case,
          stability is provided by numerous control systems rather than one or
          two.</li>
      </ul>
      
      <p>Applied to farming it can be seen
      that greater stability will be attained by farming systems that have
      access to the greatest number of control elements to deal with a variable
      economic environment, and fluctuating weather and pests. Out of the
      present farming systems, integrated no-till has the greatest flexibility
      available since the farmer can choose not only to farm no-till but can
      change to straight integrated, or conventional or even organic although
      the latter without appropriate approval from organic associations. The
      no-till farmer can use a range of pesticides as necessary or even those
      used by organic farmers. In other words managerial flexibility, adaptive
      management is the solution that comes from this brief analysis. The
      straight organic farmer has the least flexibility constrained by
      regulations and a supposed desire for self-sufficiency that isolates the
      farm from the stabilising influences of other farming systems and
      production. Primary problems with organic farming are the inability to
      control adequately pests and weeds. Even when pesticides are used by the
      organic farmer, it needs to be pointed out that this represents a
      reductionist approach in a form of farming that claims to be just
      holistic. Screening for organic pesticide residues is not currently
      undertaken and should be. It is perhaps ironic that the two extremes of
      farming, the unthinking conventional farmer that merely reads instructions
      on bottles and the unthinking organic farmer that merely lives by the
      regulations are currently the least sustainable forms of agriculture.</p>
      
      <p>In trying to meld these two
      recommendations together certain suggestions emerge that need further
      research. Farmers would be better off continually varying their herbicide
      and pesticide regime, continually varying the types of herbicide or
      pesticide as well; change crops frequently in fields, longer rotations,
      diversify ploughing methods and changing them between different fields.
      Use the traditional ley (wheat undersown with legumes) variably. Use
      different genotypes in fields although there are economic problems with
      acceptance of mixtures of genotypes for human food but not for animal
      feed. The aim is variety of controls not one monotonous solution to a
      multifaceted problem.</p>
      
      <h4>Systems approaches to integrated
      pest management.</h4>
      

      <p>Integrated pest management
      represents the perfect example of systems approaches applied to pests.
      Pests, pest predators (insects, viruses, fungi, some vertebrates), disease
      organisms, crops, pest food recognition and pheromone sensing form a
      highly-interconnected system that is used as the knowledge base for
      integrated pest management. How such systems are persuaded to sustainably
      reduce pest populations is still uncertain. But impacts at many places on
      the system are more likely to succeed than just one; as critics of
      pesticide-use only frequently point out.</p>
      
      <p>It is not difficult to see why
      pesticides used on their own do have limitations. A network is a robust
      but sometimes fragile structure (a single mutation can, for example,
      destroy a bacterial cell). But the robustness comes from the coherence and
      integrity of the network structure that underpins it. Impact at one point
      has numerous influences but constraint from the rest of the system resists
      change. Usually the pesticide kills the pest predators that could help
      keep the pest in check. Or pesticides destabilise the whole pest/pest
      predator network which simply collapses leading to flushes of uncontrolled
      pest reproduction. The pest in the longer term can also acquire resistance
      quickly.</p>
      
      <p>In a pest/pest predator network what
      is needed is to strengthen the connections on the pest predator side and
      thus inevitably weaken those those on the pest side. In integrated pest
      management various various possibilities are available in terms of
      increasing pest predator numbers by deliberate inundative release,
      provision of environments for predator reproduction (such as beetle banks
      or crop refuges) and the provision of food for pest predators when pest
      numbers are small. Different rows of crops in the same fields can confuse
      predators but have current problems in easy harvesting. The introduction
      of specific pest viruses and pest fungal disease should also help. Genetic
      manipulation should also provide a variety of possible openings
      particularly in the improvement of viruses.</p>
      
      <p>Here again a lesson from Nature
      suggests strategy. Some plants use a moving target model in dealing with
      pests. As soon as herbivory is detected, resistance mechanisms are
      randomly increased throughout the plant. The pest is then placed in the
      uncertain position of not knowing whether the next leaf will be edible or
      will kill. The response of many pests is to move away from such fields and
      to try elsewhere. It is now possible to raise the expression of the
      insecticidal protein, Bt, in the chloroplasts of plants to such high
      levels that 100% kill is detected. (Chloroplast location has the added
      advantage of not being expressed in pollen). However there is often a
      yield penalty when producing resistant plants. The moving target model
      could be mimicked by mixing susceptible with resistant crops in the same
      field. The susceptible plants could then act like a refuge reducing the
      progress towards resistance and would compensate for some loss of yield.
      The more likely result would be that certain mixtures would be very
      resistant, the proportion determined by experiment.</p>
      
      <h4>Conclusion.</h4>
      
      <p>If the farm is viewed as a system it
      is quite clear that the farmer is the pinnacle of the hierarchy of
      subsystems that control farm activity. Pesticide and organic regulations
      undercut the experience the farmer has of his own farm, knowledge which is
      often hard won and necessary for a robust farm. However in all the
      discussions about new forms of farming at the end of the day it is the
      farmer who is the lynchpin determining methods and crops. And the
      necessity for making a profit is the usually the highest objective because
      without profit the farm does not survive. Any form of farming can survive
      if the public buy the produce and pay the price.</p>
      
      <p>All farmers should be encouraged to
      think in much greater detail about the nature of their farm; good farmers
      already do but poor farmers probably do not. As in so many areas of human
      activity poor management and thus poor farming leads to failure, disease,
      pollution and soil degradation. How agriculture develops depends in the
      main whether farmers will go along with what is suggested and in the usual
      terms is whether it will increase profit. Resilient systems depend on
      growth in communication, knowledge, organisational capacity and wealth.
      While governments cannot easily legislate about the last one, increased
      farming activity should generate greater levels of wealth in which more
      farmers benefit. However governments can accelerate the growth of
      communication and knowledge and encourage growth in organisational
      capacity. Those four important system factors have been mentioned in one
      way or another in this script and are a recipe for creating a resilient
      system in the face of an uncertain climactic and world economic climate.</p>
      
      <h4>Discussion</h4>
      
      <ul>
        <li>Historically, the development of organic
          agriculture has been a response to reductionist demands. At present
          the main aims of research and development are to try to increase the
          robustness of the system as much as possible. There is anecdotal
          evidence about methods to try to increase robustness, for example
          multiple cropping systems which suffer few pest problems.</li>
      </ul>
      
      <ul>
        <li>In conceptual terms, integrated farm management
          doesn't differ very greatly from organic management. The difference
          is that one system continues to use pesticides if necessary. If a
          diversity of crops are grown simultaneously it will stabilise the
          field, but there will be reduced yield compared to just growing a
          single crop. Diversity in the cropping can lead to diversity of
          production for the market, which is a good stabiliser.</li>
      </ul>
      
      <ul>
        <li>It is hard to consider the farm as a single
          system in the context of the global food market but there is the need
          to put artificial boundaries around any system because ultimately the
          whole world is a system. The farmer reacts adaptively to the system as
          it changes. Organic farmers try to ring-fence their farm so nothing
          that affects their organic method of farming is allowed as an input.
          This is unrealistic, and the bigger picture must be acknowledged.</li>
      </ul>
      
      <ul>
        <li>The farmer's understanding of management and
          farmer education is critical. There have been problems in the past
          with a patriarchal attitude to farmers, where they have been issued
          with &quot;global&quot; instructions e.g. for pesticides application.
          This took away a sense of value of the individual knowledge the
          farmers had and there is a need to return to this principle.</li>
      </ul>
      
      <ul>
        <li>In organic farming it is clear what procedures
          are permissible and forbidden through the rules from the Soil
          Association. In contrast, it means nothing to the consumer if a group
          of farmers are using ICM- as consumers don't understand the
          principles involved. Guidelines <i>are </i>available to ICM farmers
          through LEAF (Leaf.org) and includes prescriptions on issues such as
          hedgerows boundaries and animal welfare.</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h4>GENERAL DISCUSSION</h4>
      
      <h4>Application technology</h4>
      <p>In the next 5-10 years it is clear
      that insecticides will still be the major form of pest control. There is
      the need to examine appropriate technology for application i.e. finding
      ways of better applying the product, minimizing harm to the environment
      and reducing residues. It is unlikely that companies will carry out this
      type of research as their money tends to be invested into areas of
      regulation and formulation.</p>
      
      <p>In improving application there
      should be a greater focus on the crops that the public are most concerned
      about. Multidisciplinary approaches are important and the merging of
      research institutes may help with this. There should also be better
      opportunities for reciprocal transfer of information between the UK and
      overseas interests.</p>
      
      <h4>Regulation</h4>
      <p>It is a mistake to blame the
      regulatory system for the relative lack of development of new technologies
      like biocontrols and the use of botanical pesticides. The drawbacks of
      commercialisation of such products are an issue that should be addressed.</p>
      
      <p>It <i>is</i> possible for the
      regulation process to move quickly; in 1995 the &quot;Escort&quot; meeting
      in the Netherlands devised a new regulatory system for the protection of
      beneficial insects in Europe. Within four years this was revised into a
      better system. Short timescales can be effective in reaching solutions.</p>
      
      <h4>Loss of the arsenal against pests</h4>
      <p>A principal concern is that in the
      event of a real health or food emergency, the chemicals to address this
      emergency will no longer be available. In the future, the public and
      politicians may ask why scientists knew that tools were going to be lost
      but did not speak out, and had no new tools ready to address future
      emergencies.</p>
      
      <p>There is a need to educate farmers
      to accept slower acting chemicals and for new active ingredients and new
      modes of action. Only four to five companies will be able to afford the
      background science in-house to make major moves forward in novel
      insecticide discovery. There is a case for significant public sector
      funding into alternative pest control options.</p>
      
      <p>When considering the evolution of
      plant-insect interactions, insects are often treated as if they are a
      uniform group that attack the plants in the same way. This is clearly
      untrue, for example the distinction between sucking and chewing insects..
      The reason why plants exist is because they are extremely well defended
      against insect attack. There is great scope to further harness the natural
      arsenal of defences that plants have and to exploit their available
      biodiversity. It is easier economically to find a magic bullet that will
      kill all insects in all circumstances. However,there is a need to
      acknowledge the differences between different types of insects and find
      appropriate control measures.</p>
      
      <p>It is essential to consider the
      pesticides that are currently available as a finite resource because there
      is a real potential for resistance to develop quickly. Chemical companies
      should not sell a single active new ingredient and these should always be
      combined with others to protect long-term efficacy.</p>
      
      <h4>The need for applied ecology</h4>
      <p>There is a need for more research in
      applied ecology and a shift in funding to favour this approach. There is
      also a need to intensify the use of new molecular tools to understand
      better individual pests and the economic damage they cause in different
      systems of production.</p>
      
      <p>Questions that merit further study
      include: why some pests are more prone to developing resistance than
      others and the dynamics of colonisation of natural pests in a crop.</p>
      
      <p>The functional value of biodiversity
      must be remembered. In establishing priorities for conservation it is
      important to understand the compensatory effect on natural enemies as a
      consequence of reducing pesticide use.</p>
      
      <h4>Appropriate/new technology</h4>
      <p>This meeting has not substantially
      discussed the use of conventional plant breeding for resistance against
      insect pests and sadly there has been a loss of public sector funding in
      this area.</p>
      
      <p>The sophisticated use made of
      pesticides in the UK is not transferable across the world. If pesticides
      are used without the rest of the support system of technology, they will
      not work successfully.</p>
      
      <p>It is not possible to solve tomorrow's
      agricultural problems with today's technology. This is very true for
      insect control. New and appropriate tools are needed that are integrated
      into an ecosystem in a holistic fashion. In some cases it is worth
      revisiting existing technologies to assess their potential future benefit.</p>
      
      <p>There needs to be a ratchet
      mechanism in British agriculture to facilitate the adoption of new
      technology. Future progress will be based on the evolution of current
      thinking rather than a revolution of something completely new.</p>
      
      <h4>Consumer issues</h4>
      <p>There is a strong need to
      &quot;decriminalise&quot; pesticides in the public perspective. The fact
      that there is a toolkit available incorporating a number of options for
      pest control should be a reassuring message for consumers. It is important
      to involve consumers and farmers in decision-making processes in order to
      build back trust.</p>
      
      <p>Consumers should feel reassured,
      particularly on the subject of rigorous regulation. It is important to
      find a way to tell consumers that there is a need for some pest control.
      Communication of issues of risk and uncertainty are also important,
      particularly in the new technologies such as GM crops.</p>
      
      
      
      
      
      <h4>Farmers</h4>
      <p>Farmers should be encouraged to move
      away from a uniform approach to their farms (e.g. cutting hedges around
      the whole farm at the same time) and to treat each part in an appropriate
      way to maximise diversity.</p>
      
      <p>There should be more
      cross-referencing between the interests of different farming systems,
      whether organic or conventional. There should also be cross-referencing
      between intellectual interests and economic interests. There is a strong
      imperative for change and the fragility of world food security means that
      effective pest control cannot be forgotten.</p>
