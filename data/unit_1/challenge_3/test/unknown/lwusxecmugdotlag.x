<p>
There are limited opportunities to characterise martian dust devils. However, these phenomena occur naturally on Earth and can be produced in the laboratory. This work presents conclusions from these two techniques. Three previous dust devil campaigns are examined to characterise the behaviour of these convective vortices. Spaceflight instruments were tested and the overall structure of dust devils was classified. The laboratory work presents findings reinforcing the idea that naturally occurring dust devils can be studied using laboratory simulations. A number of different types of vortex are discussed that can be produced using this laboratory method, and compared to naturally occurring dust devils on Earth and Mars.
