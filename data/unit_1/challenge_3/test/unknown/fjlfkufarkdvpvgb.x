        The M.Phil. in Anglo-Saxon, Norse and Celtic</h1>
      <p>The M.Phil. in Anglo-Saxon, Norse and Celtic provides a one-year course 
        of study in the scholarly methods and disciplines relevant to the understanding 
        of the history, material culture, languages and literatures of the different 
        peoples of the British Isles and Scandinavia in the early Middle Ages 
        (from the fifth century to the twelfth). The course allows candidates 
        the possibility of achieving an understanding of early Insular culture 
        as a whole, but also of specialising in aspects of particular interest, 
        whether historical, literary, papaeographical or linguistic (including 
        such languages as Insular Latin, Old English, Old Norse, Medieval Welsh, 
        Medieval Irish, Middle Breton or Middle Cornish).</p>
      <p>Teaching for the course consists of individual supervision, classes and 
        seminars. Flexibility, and the possibility of tailoring supervision and 
        instruction to individual needs, are the Department's priorities. Instruction 
        is given in scholarly methods and information technology, as well as in 
        the particular field of the candidate's interest. </p>
      <p>The University Library's extensive collections of manuscripts and printed 
        books provide a rich background for research, augmented by many specialist 
        holdings in College Libraries.</p>
      <p>In addition to following classes and seminars in scholarly methods and 
        information technology specified for the course, candidates for the M.Phil. 
        will also have the opportunity of attending lectures in the Department 
        relevant to their individual interests.</p>
      <h4 align="left">The examined elements of the course are:</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>A review of scholarship (not exceeding 5,000 words) in the candidate's 
          dissertation field, due at the end of Michaelmas term and worth 10% 
        </li>
        <li>A written exercise in palaeography, a language or other subject taught 
          in the Department, sat at the end of Lent term and worth 15%</li>
        <li> A second written exercise in another subject or an essay on an approved 
          subject (not exceeding 4,000 words) due at the end of Lent term and 
          worth 15%</li>
        <li> A take-home essay examination on seminar texts read in Michaelmas 
          and Lent terms, due at the beginning of Easter term and worth 10%</li>
        <li>A dissertation of between 10,000 and 15,000 words due at the end of 
          Easter term and worth 50%.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Classes and the M.Phil. Seminar run throughout the Michaelmas and Lent 
        terms and the work done in relation to them is assessed between November 
        to April. During Easter term candidates present their dissertation research 
        to the M.Phil Research Forum in preparation for the submission of their 
        dissertations in mid-June.</p>
      <h2><a name="applications" id="applications">Entry Requirements and Admissions 
        Procedures</a></h2>
      <p>You may find it helpful to find out about <a 
      href="Funding.htm">funding for home students</a> or <a 
      href="OSFunding.htm">funding for overseas students</a> before you apply. 
        You should also consult our guide for <a 
      href="Grad_Info.htm">prospective graduates</a>. All graduate students in 
        Cambridge are members of a College as well as of a Faculty of the University, 
        and those applying through the Board of Graduate Studies for a place on 
        the course will find themselves invited to list a number of Colleges in 
        order of preference. It is a good idea to consult the <a 
      href="http://www.cam.ac.uk/CambUniv/Finding/Addresses/college.html">prospectuses 
        of a number of Colleges</a> before you apply. </p>
      <p>Applications are first considered by the Faculty. Potential supervisors 
        are then consulted. Successful applications are then offered to the Colleges 
        of the student's choice, and may be then passed on to the second or third 
        choice. Since this can be a lengthy process it is very much in the interests 
        of applicants to apply in good time (and before the <strong>deadline for 
        applications of February 15th). Applications received after the deadline 
        will be considered, but inevitably space may be restricted.</strong></p>
      <p>Applicants for funding should be aware that many funding bodies (e.g. 
        the <a href="http://www.ahrb.ac.uk">Arts and Humanities Research Council </a>) 
        require a firm acceptance from the University before they will consider 
        your application. If you hope to have a decision from the University in 
        time to apply for funding, you should apply well before the <strong>February 
        15th </strong>deadline. You may find it helpful in drawing up your funding 
        application to have had some discussion with the person assigned to be 
        your supervisor.</p>
      <p>Applicants should normally have a first-class honours degree or high 
        II.i , or its overseas/international equivalent. Applicants whose first 
        degrees are in other disciplines are always considered, provided they 
        can give an account of how their interest in literary study has developed. 
        We welcome qualified UK, EU, and overseas applicants (those for whom English 
        is not a first language will be required by the Board of Graduate Studies 
        to provide evidence of linguistic proficiency). </p>
      <p>Applicants should include specific proposals for advanced study or research 
        (of around 500 words). A piece of written work, of 5,000 words, should 
        accompany a formal application. Applicants may submit any work they like, 
        but it is worth choosing work which is recent and which relates to your 
        proposed area of study, if this is available. Many applicants submit their 
        undergraduate dissertation or similar extended piece of work. In reaching 
        decisions about applications the Degree Committee takes particular account 
        of: </p>
      <ul>
        <li><span class="mainbody">The applicant's academic record and references 
          </span> </li>
        <li><span class="mainbody">Their suitability for the proposed course (including 
          knowledge of foreign languages) </span> </li>
        <li><span class="mainbody">The applicant's research proposal, which should 
          suggest a realistic program of work for a 15,000 word dissertation. 
          </span> </li>
        <li><span class="mainbody">Whether a suitable supervisor can be found 
          for the proposed research </span> </li>
        <li><span class="mainbody">The written work which a candidate submits 
          in support of their application </span></li>
      </ul>
