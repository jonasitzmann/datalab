                      <p>The Master of Business studies is a broad-based programme 
                        designed to provide graduates, in disciplines other than 
                        those closely related to business and management, with 
                        the necessary knowledge, understanding, skills and strategic 
                        thinking required for successful performance in the modern 
                        environment of management. </p>
                      <p>It is particularly suited for graduates who require a 
                        bridge between their university academic studies and the 
                        needs of employment. The addition of MBS to a first degree 
                        will make students more attractive to potential employers.                      </p>
                      <p>It is also appropriate for experienced managers who lack 
                        a theoretical understanding of the wide range of economic 
                        and social factors that underpin the global environment 
                        of business and for whom a Masters qualification would 
                        enhance their career prospects.</p>

                      the course...</strong></p>
                    
                      <p>&quot;I have  worked in the tobacco processing industry overseas for 30 years and gained a  lot of practical work experience starting off as a trainee supervisor in 1972  and finishing as a factory manager in 2006. </p>
                      <p>I returned  to the UK  looking for a course which would allow me to transfer my knowledge of industry  into a useful business qualification and I decided to study for the MBS.  Initially I was apprehensive as I would be a mature student who had been out of  full time education for more than 20 years. I started the course last year and  have successfully completed 3 core modules so far. The mix of students both  international and domestic creates a great learning and social environment. I  have had the opportunity to interact with students of different age groups and  cultures increasing my knowledge of business while working towards a good  qualification. I intend to start a business as soon as I qualify. The MBS is  giving me the knowledge of business required to succeed. Age has not been a  detriment while the facility to study full or part time and pay as you go is  highly recommended.&quot;</p>

                      <p>"Having graduated from   Leeds University in 2004&nbsp;with a first degree in a Science discipline,&nbsp;I embarked   upon a career in sales in the finance industry for a Blue Chip Global company.   Working in such a vibrant and&nbsp;demanding environment had discouraged me from   continuing with my studies until I discovered how flexible the part time MBS at   Trinity &amp; All Saints  was. </p>
                      <p>Studying part time has   allowed me to gain much valued work experience to build up my CV as well as   continuing my studies in order to enhance my career prospects. The course is   extremely flexible allowing me to work my studies around work demands and even   around changing shift patterns! </p>
                      <p>All classes are held in   mixed groups with people from all backgrounds which has broadened my knowledge   of different cultures and I have really benefited from the experiences of   others. Trinity &amp; All   Saints' "Pay as you Learn" approach to   financing my studies was one of&nbsp;the&nbsp;big deciding factors in my decision to return to University. </p>
                      <p>With a background in   Science and a career in finance&nbsp; - I really feel the MBS has given me skills   which will lead to excellent employment opportunities in the future."</p>

                    <p>'I had been  looking to further my skill sets and obtain a better understanding of all  aspects of business in general.&nbsp;I work as a sales executive for a global  distribution company and have a scientific first degree. The MBS course has  helped me to better understand how the different business functions integrate  within the company and with this knowledge I have developed better internal  relationships with colleagues.&nbsp;I particularly enjoyed applying the formal  tuition in the 'Business Simulation' module which encouraged&nbsp;team working  skills.&nbsp;My career prospects have been enhanced by the MBS qualification.'<br>

                      <hr width="50%">                    <p>&quot;Having finished my undergraduate studies at Trinity and All Saints I was alerted to the MBS course. While I had no real business background I thought it seemed like an opportunity to further my education in a friendly environment. The course was varied, challenging and fun. Our close-knit group, including a number of foreign students, business people and graduates, worked with the extensive support of module tutors on a number of diverse assignments. Among these projects involved the challenge of trying to run our own business on a computer simulation package, as well as learning the various issues of running a business. Having graduated in December 2004 I went straight into work as a business analyst for Provident Financial. </p>
                    <p>The MBS helped me get a job which I enjoy, and aided my learning. I also made a number of good friends during the course, including a Chinese student who I have stayed in touch with. I am planning to visit China in the future and we are considering setting up an import/ export business. Without the MBS and the support of the tutors I would not have considered such adventurous ideas, nor had the knowledge of business to make them happen. &quot;</p>

                    <p>&quot;I decided to study the MBS course at Trinity and 
                        All Saints College to equip me with a good all round business 
                        education during a career break having my family. The course 
                        not only fits in well with a young family, but hopefully 
                        it will supplement my first degree in Law, and give me a 
                        competititve edge in securing a job. The teaching is of 
                        a good standard, with students from both business and non-business 
                        backgrounds which provides for interesting discussions.&quot;                      </p>

                    &quot;I was looking for a Masters level programme in Business 
                        which would give me the flexibility to fit in with my other 
                        commitments and Trinity and All Saints provided me with 
                        exactly what I required through its MBS Programme.

                      own studies, and the assesment programme is relevant to 
                      the real work of business.</p>
