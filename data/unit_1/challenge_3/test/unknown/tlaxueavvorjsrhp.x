      <p>The new M.Phil. in Criticism and Culture, launched in October 2004, is 
        an innovative nine-month course of literary study with an interdisciplinary 
        and comparative focus, running from October until the end of June. It 
        aims to provide an introduction to and training in different aspects of 
        contemporary literary criticism and literary and cultural theory. You 
        will be encouraged to develop a critical and methodological framework, 
        and to pursue questions relating to literary and cultural production alongside 
        your individual research project. Within a flexible framework, you will 
        be able to study particular areas in depth or explore topics broadly relevant 
        to your intended research. Each student works closely with a member of 
        the Faculty on his or her chosen dissertation topic while participating 
        in collaborative seminars and classes. </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>The three-term course will consist of a changing program of seminars, 
        combined with a reading group and a dissertation group bringing students 
        together for collaborative exchange. You will write papers in the first 
        two terms, followed by a final dissertation on the research topic of your 
        choice. You will be able to construct an individual program tailored to 
        your research interests, in close consultation with an advisor who will 
        usually also serve as your dissertation supervisor for the third and final 
        term. All M.Phil. students are strongly encouraged to attend the English 
        Faculty's graduate research seminars, which consist of presentations by 
        outside speakers, faculty, and graduate students. You will also have the 
        chance to attend lectures in other fields in the Humanities and to explore 
        the interdisciplinary possibilities of graduate study at Cambridge. In 
        addition, you will be able to draw on the University's language-learning 
        facilities and exceptional library resources and special collections.</p>
      <p>The M.Phil. in Criticism and Culture is designed to provide a gateway 
        to a wide range of different research areas, including areas that are 
        historically based. You will be able to take courses and subjects from 
        other M.Phils. in English, as well as from M.Phils in certain other faculties 
        (see below). Registration for the Ph.D. on topics that fall within the 
        purview of the Criticism and Culture Graduate Subject Committee will normally 
        require students to have completed either the M.Phil. in Criticism and 
        Culture or one of the English Faculty's other M.Phils at an appropriate 
        level, or the equivalent at another university.<br />

      <p>Seminars run throughout the first two terms, Michaelmas and Lent. You 
        will be able to choose two courses per term from a changing selection 
        (usually three or four courses) on offer each term, depending on the research 
        interests and availability of academic staff. At least one course would 
        normally be drawn from the list of courses specific to the Criticism and 
        Culture M.Phil. (Option 
        A courses). In either term (timetable and availability permitting) qualified 
        students may opt to take one of their courses from another M.Phil. in 
        English or from an M.Phil. in certain other faculties (Option B courses). 
        M.Phils currently offered in English are <a href="MedRen_MPhil_Info.htm">Medieval 
        and Renaissance Literature</a>, <a href="1700_MPhil_Info.htm">18th Century 
        and Romantic Studies </a>, and <a href="AmLit_MPhil_Info.htm">American 
        Literature</a>. M.Phils. with which English has exchange arrangements 
        at present include European Literature (<a href="http://www.mml.cam.ac.uk/">Faculty 
        of Medieval and Modern Languages [MML]</a>), <a href="http://www.hoart.cam.ac.uk/">

        Science and Medicine (<a href="http://www.hps.cam.ac.uk/">Faculty of History 
        and Philosophy of Science [HPS]</a>).</p>
      <p>All courses meet weekly from weeks 2 to 7 for 1.5 hours (or longer by discretion of 
        the seminar-convenor). The Criticism &amp; Culture Reading Group meets 
        each week; the dissertation writing groups meet in 
      small student facilitated groups during Easter Term. </p>

          <p>Derrida claimed that the seeds of his subsequent writing were all
            contained in his earliest work; and, together with 'Writing and Difference'
            (1967), 'Of Grammatology' (1967) may be considered the seminal text
            of his oeuvre. This seminar will devote itself, not to learning about
            Derrida, but to reading what he wrote. to do this we will read the
            texts that Derrida attends to in 'Of Grammatology' (including writings
            by Levi-Strauss, Rousseau, Heidegger, Freud, and Andre Leroi Gourhan),
            while also reading his own text. By the end of the seminar members
            will have felt for themselves the movement, and experienced the influence
            , of Derrida's thought.</p>

          <p>This course combines historical and theoretical perspectives on
            the  place of the body in culture, from early modernity through to
            modernist 
            conceptions of embodiment. The classes will examine specific literary
             texts, including Montaigne, Shakespeare, Mary Shelley, and Joyce,
            
            alongside theorists of the body, including Bakhtin, Nietzsche, Freud
             and Lacan. Some questions we will explore include: What part does
            
            the body play in the construction of self and other? What makes bodies
             such compelling objects of desire or repulsion? How is the immediate
            
            materiality of the body represented in literary texts? How, conversely,
             can the body itself be 'written' - marked and changed by ideological
            
            and historical forces? What, ultimately, can we say about the enigmatic
             relation between the body and language? </p>

          <p>Since Oedipus and the positing of castration anxiety, the founding
            myths of Freudian psychoanalysis have been concerned with sight and
            un-seeing, or blindness. More recently, the idea of a scopic drive
            has tended to focused on the gaze (Lacan) or on the relation between
            perception, hallucination, and negative hallucination (Winnicott,
            Bion, Andr&eacute; Green). This course will read psychoanalytic writing
            alongside philosophers such as Merleau-Ponty (The Visible Invisible),
            Derrida (The Truth in Painting, Memoirs of the Blind), critics such
            as Barthes (Image/Text, Camera Lucida), and recent art criticism
            that has drawn on psychoanalytic and theoretical texts, including
            Fried, Berger, T.J. Clark, and Krauss. Although not a visual culture
            course as such, it will make connections with past and present artists
            and art-works as well as with literary criticism by Scarry, Fisher,
            and others. </p>

          <p><strong><a name="Trotter" id="Trotter">PROFESSOR D.TROTTER, 'Naturalism'
                 in Literature and Cinema</a>
          </strong> </p>
          <p> Naturalism was perhaps the late-c19th&#8217;s most significant
            contribution to the repertoire of plots and descriptive techniques
            available for figuring (and figuring out) human experience. Although
            it took various forms, in fiction and drama, its primary aim was
            to explore and exploit (physical, moral, and social) &#8216;lowness&#8217;.
            Naturalism let loose in the world a narrative which, rather than
            bind events into significance, as most narratives do, unbound them
            from it. The narrative unbinding was consistently a narrative of
          unbinding: of social and moral disintegration. </p>
          <p>These classes will not seek to define a Naturalist &#8216;tradition&#8217; in
            modern literature and cinema. Instead, they will ask why an impulse
            to Naturalism should so persistently have reasserted itself, in a
            wide variety of modes and contexts, throughout the c20th: in defiance
            of Modernism, in defiance of metafiction, in defiance of the hegemony
            of generic formula. </p>
          <p>The classes are intended to encourage various kinds of work towards
            a theory and a history of the &#8216;modern&#8217;. At issue are,
            or could be: the politics of style, in literature and film; genre,
            in literature and film; the relation between word and image; the
            gendering of stories of decline and disintegration; cultural &#8216;nation-building&#8217;;
            interpretation and/as aesthetic pleasure; interpretation and/as social
            pathology. There would be no objection to a focus on an individual
            writer or film-maker.</p>

        you take in other faculties will be assessed by the requirements for that 
        course in the host faculty. To prepare for your dissertation, you will 
        produce a detailed bibliography by the end of the first term, and a detailed

    <p>You may find it helpful to find out about <a 
      href="Funding.htm">funding for home 
      students</a> or <a 
      href="OSFunding.htm">funding for 
      overseas students</a> before you apply. You should also consult our guide 
      for <a 
      href="Grad_Info.htm">prospective 
      graduates</a>. All graduate students in <em><img src="images/bombay-1873.jpg" width="230" height="305" align="left" hspace="3" vspace="5" /></em>Cambridge 
      are members of a College as well as of a Faculty of the University, and 
      those applying through the Board of Graduate Studies for a place on the 
      course will find themselves invited to list a number of Colleges in order 
      of preference. It is a good idea to consult the <a 
      href="http://www.cam.ac.uk/CambUniv/Finding/Addresses/college.html">prospectuses 
      of a number of Colleges</a> before you apply. </p>
    <p>Applications are first considered by the Faculty. Potential supervisors 
      are then consulted. Successful applications are then offered to the Colleges 
      of the student's choice, and may be then passed on to the second or third 
      choice. Since this can be a lengthy process it is very much in the interests 
      of applicants to apply in good time (and before the <strong>new deadline 
      for applications of January 15th). Applicants are urged to make sure that 
      duplicates of their application materials are sent direct to the English 
      Faculty as well as to the Board of Graduate Studies (see general instructions 
      for admission to English).</strong></p>

    <p>Applicants for funding should be aware that many funding bodies (e.g. the 
      <a href="http://www.ahrb.ac.uk">Arts and Humanities Research Council</a>) 
      require a firm acceptance from the University before they will consider 
      your application. If you hope to have a decision from the University in 
      time to apply for funding, you should apply well before the <strong>January 
      15th </strong>deadline. You may find it helpful in drawing up your funding 
      application to have had some discussion with the person assigned to be your 
      supervisor. Please consult the separate instructions for <a href= "http://www.admin.cam.ac.uk/univ/gsprospectus/funding/overseas/applying/deadlines.html"> 
      application deadlines</a> on the Board of Graduate Studies website.</p>
    <p>Applicants should normally have a first-class honours degree or high II.i 
      , or its overseas/international equivalent (e.g. minimum 3.7 GPA). Applicants 
      whose first degrees are in other disciplines are always considered, provided 
      they can give an account of how their interest in literary study has developed. 
      We welcome qualified UK, EU, and overseas applicants (those for whom English 
      is not a first language will be required by the Board of Graduate Studies 
      to provide evidence of linguistic proficiency). </p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
   
    <p>Applicants should include specific proposals for advanced study or research
      (of around 500 words). A piece of written work, of 5,000 - 7,500 words,
      should accompany a formal application. Applicants may submit any work they
      like, but it is worth choosing work which is recent and which relates to
      your proposed area of study, if this is available. Many applicants submit
      their undergraduate dissertation or similar extended piece of work. In
      reaching decisions about applications the Degree Committee takes particular
      account of: </p>
    <ul>
      <li><span class="mainbody">The applicant's academic record and references </span> </li>
      <li><span class="mainbody">Their suitability for the proposed course (including
          knowledge of foreign languages) </span> </li>
      <li><span class="mainbody">The applicant's research proposal, which should
          suggest a realistic program of work for a 15,000 word dissertation. </span> </li>
      <li><span class="mainbody">Whether a suitable supervisor can be found for
          the proposed research </span> </li>
      <li><span class="mainbody">The written work which a candidate submits in
          support of their application </span></li>
