I am a Professor in the Department of Physics, and Fellow and Tutor in Physics 
at <a href="http://www.trinity.ox.ac.uk/">Trinity College</a>, University of Oxford, UK. In the Department I lecture on <a href="http://www.atm.ox.ac.uk/user/read/mechanics/mech_web_mt.htm">Classical Mechanics</a> to first year Physics students, geophysical and planetary fluid dynamics in the final year <a href="http://www.atm.ox.ac.uk/user/andrews/option.html">Physics of Atmospheres and Oceans</a> course, and on deterministic chaos in the Short Option course <a href="http://www.atm.ox.ac.uk/user/read/chaos/chaos.html">Chaos, Chance and Predictability</a> for 2nd and 3rd year physicists. At Trinity College I am senior subject tutor, and teach roughly half the first and second year undergraduate courses in mainstream physics and mathematics, and on third year climate physics and fluid flow, to Trinity students.<BR>

<h2>Research Interests</h2>
Since 1991, I have worked in the Atmospheric, Oceanic and Planetary Physics sub-Department 
at Oxford, where I head the Geophysical and Planetary Fluid Dynamics research group. 
Current research activities include a strong element of fundamental hydrodynamics with applications to planetary atmospheres and oceans, particularly with regard 
to dynamical and transport processes in rotating fluids, and the development of chaotic 
flow through the nonlinear interactions of baroclinic and barotropic waves (highly 
relevant to the atmosphere of Mars) and other processes (e.g. inertia-gravity waves, geostrophic turbulence etc.). 
I am also closely involved in a number of specifically planetary projects, including 
the development of simplified and comprehensive General Circulation Models (GCMs) 
of the atmospheres of Mars, Jupiter and Saturn, Venus etc. and the application of advanced meteorological data 
assimilation methods (as used in operational weather forecasting) to the analysis 
of spacecraft observations of planetary atmospheres. <BR>

<h2>Planetary Missions</h2>
I was a Co-investigator on the PMIRR (Pressure Modulator Infrared Radiometer) team 
for NASA's Mars Climate Orbiter mission (launched in December 1998 and lost in September 1999!), with responsibility 
for producing global analyses of atmospheric structure and meteorology from the PMIRR and radio science observations via data assimilation. I am also a Co-investigator 
on the CIRS (Composite Infrared Spectrometer) team for the NASA/ESA Cassini orbiter 
mission (launched in October 1997), and am involved in studies of dynamical processes in the atmospheres of Jupiter, Saturn and Titan. I am also a Co-investigator on the Mars Climate Sounder instrument team on the NASA Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter mission (launched in 2005), responsible for studies of the atmospheric circulation and meteorology of Mars.  <BR>
<BR>
I am a Fellow of the Royal Meteorological Society (RMS), the Royal Astronomical Society 
(RAS) and the European Geosciences Union (EGS). Between 1996 and 2000 I was Chairman of the 
Interdisciplinary Working Group on Nonlinear Processes in Geophysics in EGS, and 
have been associate editor of the journals Physics and Chemistry of the 
Earth and Surveys in Geophysics. I am currently Co- Editor of the Quarterly Journal of the RMS.<BR>
