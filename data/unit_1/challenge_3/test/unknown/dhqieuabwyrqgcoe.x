      <h1 align="center">Frequently Asked Questions</h1>
      <p>This FAQ is for the use of Faculty, Staff and Students who need help 
        with anything IT related in the faculty. It is not intended to replace 
        the very <a href="http://www.cam.ac.uk/cs/docs/">helpful documents located 
        at the Computing Service</a>, but merely to supplement them and differentiate 
        between the services that the faculty Computer Officer can offer and those 
        for which you must see the Computing Service. </p>
      <p></p>
      <ol type="1">
        <li> 
          <p> <strong>I've forgotten my email/PWF password. Can the Faculty Computer 
            Officer reset it for me?</strong><br />
            Unfortunately not. To reset your email password, you must visit the 
            Computing Service User Administration section on the New Museums Site 
            (<a href="http://www.cam.ac.uk/map/v3/drawmap.cgi?mp=nmus;xx=174;yy=248;mt=c">map</a>) 
            with your University ID or some other form of Identification <strong>OR</strong> 
            email CS User Admin at: <a href="mailto:user-admin&#64;ucs.cam.ac.uk">user-admin&#64;ucs.cam.ac.uk</a> 
            and they will send your new password via UMS. <br />
            <a href="http://www.cam.ac.uk/cs/docs/faq/n3.html">See the Computing 
            Service's document about password trouble</a>. </p>
        </li>
        <li> 
          <p> <strong>I would like to set up a personal web site. Will the Faculty 
            allow me to use their web server for this?</strong><br />
            No. The Faculty's web server is for Faculty Teaching and Administrative 
            purposes only. However, it is possible to set up personal space <a href="http://www.cam.ac.uk/cs/docs/leaflets/m350/">on 
            the PWF</a> (please make special note of the <a href="http://www.cam.ac.uk/cs/itsyndicate/wwwguidelines.html">guidelines 
            for publishing a personal site on the PWF</a>) or on the <a href="http://www.srcf.ucam.org"> 
            SRCF (Student-Run Computing Facility)</a>. Additionally, several colleges 
            (e.g. Churchill, Selwyn) provide their own web servers for student 
            and staff use. Please be aware that none of these services allow their 
            resources to be used for teaching purposes or for the purposes of 
            selling products or promoting a business.</p>
        </li>
        <li> 
          <p> <strong>Why can I access some parts of the faculty web site from 
            my office/PWF facility/college, but not from home?</strong><br />
            While you are using a machine on the university network, you are automatically 
            allowed into the University's local access pages as well as to the 
            restricted resources at <a href="http://www.lib.cam.ac.uk">the University 
            Library's web site</a> such as the online OED. The local access pages on the English Faculty's web site should all be identified as local access only and are accessible via RAVEN authentication. </p>
        </li>
        <li> 
          <p> <strong>What is Raven and how will it affect me as a user?</strong><br />
            Raven is a way of logging in to web-based services using 
            a password stored by the computing service. It allows or denies access 
            to a person based on their Cambridge User ID. 
            This means that some services that will currently only allow access to people using computers that are physically located somewhere in the University will start to rely on whether the individual user is 
            supposed to be able to access it rather than their physical location.<br />
            <br />
            To get your intial password, you can visit <a href="https://jackdaw.cam.ac.uk/raven-temp/get-raven-password">this 
            website</a>. You will need to know either your Hermes Mailstore (email) 
            password or your CUS password. Please be aware that this system of 
            password retrieval is only useful to collect your initial password. 
            Once you have changed your Raven password, it cannot give you your 
            new password. If you forget your Raven password, please follow the 
            steps outlined above for getting your password changed. <a href="http://www.cam.ac.uk/cs/raven/">Further information 
            on the Raven service is available from the 
            Computing Service</a>.</p>
        </li>
        <li> 
          <p> <strong>I have a problem with my computer. Should I contact the 
            Faculty Computer Officer?</strong><br />
            If your problem is on a faculty-owned computer located inside the 
            Faculty building, then please do! Unfortunately, I cannot be available 
            to help with privately- or college-owned computers. If you are a member 
            of a college, then you could try your college computer officer, first. If 
            you believe you have a hardware problem (bad hard drive, won't power 
            up, etc.) then you can try CS <a href="http://www-tus.csx.cam.ac.uk/hw_support/">Hardware 
            Support</a> on the New Museums site (<a href="http://www.cam.ac.uk/map/v3/drawmap.cgi?mp=nmus;xx=174;yy=248;mt=c">map</a>). 
            They are reasonably priced and are well-qualified to deal with either 
            Apple or Intel/AMD-based PCs.</p>
        </li>
        <li> 
          <p> <strong>I can't send .cam.ac.uk mail with my email client (e.g. 
            Mulberry, Eudora) at home. What's up?</strong><br />
            Check your outgoing mail settings and make sure that the SMTP/Outgoing mail server is set to: smtp.hermes.cam.ac.uk, that it is using TLS or SSL and that the port is set to 587. <a href="http://www.cam.ac.uk/cs/email/muasettings.html">Visit the Computing Service's MUA (Mail User Agent) Settings web page for more specific information</a>. </p>
        </li>
        <li> 
          <p> <strong>Do you have any computers you could loan me?</strong><br />
            The Faculty has a few laptops that we can loan out for short-term academic use 
            to graduate students and faculty members <strong>only</strong> . Feel 
            free to contact the Computer Officer about this. </p>
        </li>
        <li> 
          <p> <strong>Where can I find cheap computer hardware locally?</strong><br />
            The Computing Service has a <a href="http://www.cam.ac.uk/cs/docs/infosheets/is1/">help 
            document for the purchase of new hardware</a>, but if you are looking 
            for second hand bargains, you might try checking the University's 
            forsale newsgroups. Use a newsgroup reader such as <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/products/thunderbird/">Mozilla 
            Thunderbird</a> (free for PC and Mac), to access the University's 
            news server at <strong>nntp-serv.cam.ac.uk</strong>, then subscribe 
            to <em>ucam.adverts.forsale.computer</em> within that account. Also, don't forget that many computer companies offer significant discounts to students and staff/faculty of educational institutions. Also, places like Dabs and MicroWarehouse have education sales divisions. These are definitely worth checking into! </p>
        </li>
        <li> 
          <p> <strong>I have some privately owned hardware that I no longer use. 
            What should I do with it?</strong><br />
            First of all, it's probably best not to throw it away - someone can 
            probably use it! Consider selling it/giving it away on the newsgroups 
            (see above), or donating it to <a href="http://www.cambridge-computer-recycling.co.uk/">Cambridge 
            Computer Recycling</a>, even if it is slightly past its best. If you have several computers/printers/monitors, etc. to be disposed of, <a href="http://www.computeraid.org/">you may also consider Computer Aid, a charity that refurbishes computers for use in schools and community organisations all over the world</a>.</p>
