    <h1 align="center">Applying</h1>
  <h2>How can I prepare for an application?<img src="images/st-johns.jpg" width="225" height="340" align="right" alt="Photo of St John's College" /></h2>
  <p>There is no simple answer to this, except possibly the words of John Milton: 'read any books whatever come to thy hands, for thou art sufficient both to judge aright, and to examine each matter.' To read widely, and to read works outside your A-Level syllabus, is the best preparation for applying to any English Faculty. It is also a good idea to ask yourself if there are any periods or areas of English literature which you do not know about. Do some browsing in your local library, and in anthologies of verse and prose. No-one though expects you to have read everything: the most important thing is to have an enthusiasm for reading, and to want to think hard about what you read. The main qualities we are looking for are creative energy, promise, and enthusiasm.</p>
  <p>To help you explore new poetry and ways of thinking, and to get an idea of the sort of work we do at Cambridge, take a look at <a 
href="http://aspirations.english.cam.ac.uk/">Converse</a>, the faculty's website for A-level and GCSE pupils</p>
  <p>It is also a very good idea to attend<b> </b>Open Days at a selection of <a 
href="http://www.cam.ac.uk/CambUniv/Finding/Addresses/college.html" 
target="_top">Colleges</a>.</p>
  <h2>How do I apply?</h2>
  <p><em>All applications for undergraduate admission are dealt with by the Colleges</em>. </p>
  <p>Before you apply you need to decide which College suits you best. You could ask a teacher at your school for advice about this, or you could consult a variety of College Prospectuses. There is also an <a 
href="http://www.cusu.cam.ac.uk/prospective/prospectus/">Alternative Prospectus</a>, written by undergraduates, which gives a practical and often irreverent view of life at all the different Colleges. The best thing to do next, though, is to <a 
href="http://www.cam.ac.uk/CambUniv/Finding/Addresses/college.html" 
target="_top">visit the College web sites </a>. These will give you useful addresses and advice on the dates of open days, and on how to apply. Your choice of College has a great impact on your time in Cambridge, so it is well worth visiting a few to get a sense of how they differ from each other. All of them will welcome enquiries.</p>
