<p><em><strong>Michaelmas Term 2006 </strong></em></p>
<p><strong>Thur 5 Oct: Introductory Discussion: &lsquo;Terms&rsquo;:<br>
</strong>This session is designed to introduce newcomers to each other and to some Americanist students, postdocs, and staff. A few of us will introduce a term or concept that has recently emerged as particularly resonant in our research, and bring a number of examples/passages of it at work, to invite general discussion. Terms to be introduced include &lsquo;confidence&rsquo;, &lsquo;front/frontline&rsquo;, &lsquo;Local/Localization&rsquo;, &lsquo;Avant-garde&rsquo;, &lsquo;Freedom&rsquo;, &lsquo;Quadroon/Octoroon&rsquo;. We may also think about the place of such examination of vocabulary in Raymond Williams&rsquo; <em>Keywords</em> and in the historical methodology Begriffsgeschichte. </p>
<p><strong>Thur 26 Oct (now in GR 04, English Faculty): American History/Literature Joint session</strong>: <br>
  Discussion of <em>Strange Fruit</em> with the new Mellon Research Fellow in American History, Dr Andrea Franzius&ndash; Billie Holiday&rsquo;s and other recordings, and extracts from David Margolick and Hilton Als, <em>Strange Fruit: the Biography of a Song</em> and Angela Davis, <em>Blues Legacies and Black Feminism: Gertrude &ldquo;Ma&rdquo; Rainey, Bessie Smith and Billie Holiday</em>. Dr Franzius suggests that useful additional material to consult would be Langston Hughes's &quot;Lynching Song.&quot; Allen Gussow's <em>Seems Like Murder Here: Southern Violence and the Blues Tradition</em> (an interesting collection of essays including an excellent one on W. C. Handy), and of course Houston Baker's work, e.g. his classic <em>Blues, Ideology, and Afro-American Literature: a Vernacular Theory</em>. An important collection of lynching photography and its commodification can be found in Allen James's <em>Without Sanctuary: Lynching Photography in America</em>. </p>
<p><strong> Thur 2 November: short papers from local Americanists:</strong><br>
  Eric White on William Carlos Williams&rsquo; Prose and Jerome Martin on Audubon's 'Sketches of Frontier Life' and Whitman's 'Leaves of Grass'. </p>
<p><strong>Thur 16 November:</strong> Dr Cynthia Hamilton ( Manchester Metropolitan University, and Rothermere Institute, Oxford) will speak on &lsquo;Sara Paretsky and the Politics of Detective Fiction&rsquo; </p>
