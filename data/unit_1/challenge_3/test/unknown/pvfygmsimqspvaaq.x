<h1>A Simple Model of Atmospheric Vortex Dynamics</h1>


Many of the processes which contribute to the large scale transport of
heat, moisture and trace chemicals through the atmosphere can be
represented in a simple two dimensional model. The following three
images represent an idealised global view of mixing processes in the
stratosphere.
The quantity plotted is absolute vorticity which has positive
values in the north and negative values in the south reflecting the
Earth's rotation.
At the beginning of the experiment the flow is zonally symmetric. 
A large scale perturbation is forced and smaller scales gradually develop
as the material lines fold over.

Later in the experiment repeated folding has generated an extremely
complex struture.
