<p>
The most successful theory to explain why observed planetary waves
propagate westwards faster than linear flat-bottom theory predicts has
been to include the effect of background baroclinic mean flow, which
modifies the potential vorticity waveguide in which the waves
propagate. That theory accounted for most, but not all, of the observed
wave speeds. A later attempt to examine the effect of the sloping
bottom on these waves (without the mean flow effect) did not find any
overall speed-up. This paper combines these two effects, assuming long
(geostrophic) waves and slowly varying mean flow and topography, and
computes group velocities at each point in the global ocean. These
velocities turn out to be largely independent of the orientation of the
wavevector. A second speed-up of the waves is found (over that for mean
flow only).The predicted speeds agree well with observations of planetary
waves deduced from sea surface height data.
