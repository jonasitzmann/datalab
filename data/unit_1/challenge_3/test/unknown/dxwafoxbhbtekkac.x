Abstract:
</H4>

<p>
Desert dunes are formed through an instability which arises through the
interaction of turbulent wind flow with an erodible sand bed. In this talk
I will describe several models which have been developed very recently to
predict this instability and follow its evolution to finite amplitude. The
mechanism of the instability is due to the effect of the developing dune
on the boundary layer flow over it, but the precise model depends on how
the turbulent flow is described. In addition, separation at the lee of the
dune provides additional complications.
