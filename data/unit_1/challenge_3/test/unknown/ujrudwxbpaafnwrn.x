<P>The sub-department's research focuses on the study of physical
processes in the atmospheres and oceans of the Earth and other
planets, using experimental and theoretical techniques.  We have about
70 members, including 10 permanent academic or research staff, about
20 post-doctoral researchers and senior visitors, and about 30
graduate students.

<P>On the experimental side we develop space instruments for infrared
remote sensing of the structure and composition of planetary
atmospheres, especially the Earth's stratosphere and mesosphere.  More
than ten of these instruments have been launched, either into Earth
orbit or to other planets; several new space experiments are under
development, including Earth-orbiting instruments to investigate
global change, and missions to Mercury, Venus and Mars.  Extensive
overseas and domestic collaborations are involved, with industrial and
scientific centres in Europe and the USA.

<P>We are an important centre for theoretical atmospheric and oceanic
modelling.  Our climate dynamics group studies the large-scale
behaviour of the atmosphere-ocean system and its response to external
drivers such as the increases in greenhouse gas levels responsible for
anthropogenic climate change. Other modelling of the Earth's
atmosphere focuses on large-scale dynamical and chemical-transport
processes relevant to climate, and on the interpretation of our
satellite data.  We also use dynamical models of other planets,
including Mars and Jupiter, to interpret existing data and help plan
new observational missions.

<P>We also investigate fundamental geophysical fluid dynamics by means
of laboratory experiments on rotating, stratified fluids.

<P>The sub-department's research involves three general areas:

<UL>

<LI><a href="instrumentation.html"> Developing instruments, and carrying out experiments, especially
on satellites.</font></a><br>

<LI><a href="dataanalysis.html">Analysing the data generated by the experimental work.</font></a><br>

<LI><a href="modelling.html">Modelling and performing theoretical work, especially relating to
climate change, the middle atmosphere, planetary atmospheres, and
laboratory experiments on fluids.</font></a><br>
