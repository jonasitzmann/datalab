		<p>As one of Britain's foremost higher education institutions for the study and advancement of fine art, design and architecture, the importance of the GSA in the cultural, social and economic life of Scotland and beyond, cannot be underestimated.  And, in a rapidly changing world where creativity is increasingly seen at the heart of a wider competitive economy, it is clear that The Glasgow School of Art will continue to play a major role in the future.</p><p>To ensure we can continue to play a major role now and in the future, the GSA has ambitious plans.  Ranging from the redevelopment of our campus with a refurbished Mackintosh Building at its heart to the creation of new research centres and the provision of scholarships and bursaries, private support is the key to making this possible.  </p><p>Across the world alumni and friends of The Glasgow School of Art are playing their part in helping us realise our plans by donating to the Creative Futures Fund and becoming International Friends of the GSA.  </p><p>Trusts, foundations and companies are also playing their part and their gifts and sponsorship is making an impact through projects such as the Clydesdale Bank Art for All workshops for over 70 secondary schools across the West of Scotland or the creation of scholarships within the International Drawing Research Institute by the Horace W. Goldsmith Foundation in New York. </p><p>Whether you are an alumnus, visitor or friend, or a trust, foundation or company, you can help the GSA to achieve its goals and we invite you to explore this site and consider how you would like to become involved.  </p><p>If you would like more information or to speak in person to someone about how you can support the GSA, please contact Scott Parsons, Head of Marketing and Development (+44(0) 141 353 4698  <a href="mailto:s.parsons@gsa.ac.uk" target="">s.parsons@gsa.ac.uk</a>)</p>
