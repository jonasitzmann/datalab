<strong>FRENCH PALAEOGRAPHY COURSE</strong><br>

Perhaps covering dates slightly late for some CERES members; but not for

others. And who would want to miss any on-line palaeography course, complete

with exams? The 13 lessons are archived at

<a href=http://www.mygale.org/07/voirin/paleo/html/sommaire.html> http://www.mygale.org/07/voirin/paleo/html/sommaire.html</a>.

<strong>MARLOWE ON-LINE</strong><br>

The Perseus Project at Tufts University (which already boasts impressive

classical materials) has released the first part of a freely available

electronic version of Christopher Marlowe's Complete Works on the web at:

<a href=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/Texts/Marlowe.html> http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/Texts/Marlowe.html</a>.

<p>

This site now provides users with the capacity to view various Dr Faustus

materials: the original 1604 text, known as the A text, as well as the

original 1616 text, the B text, alongside modernized versions of each. In

addition, the site displays the links between the A and B texts side by side

for comparison. The source text, The English Faust Book, is entered in its

entirety and can be viewed as such, or it can be viewed alongside the A or B

text where similar portions of each have been linked to one another. There

are also scholarly notes and glosses in the form of hypertextual links in

the English Faust Book. Eventually, a modernized version of the source text

will be entered as well. In addition, the textual variants for Doctor

Faustus and for all of Marlowe's other works will be entered, allowing users

to select which variant version of either the A or B text or of the various

historical collations they would like to read from. Soon the rest of

Marlowe's works, including translations, will have received similar treatment.

<strong>ZWINGLIAN REFORMATION BIBLIOGRAPHY</strong><br>

The annual bibliography 'Neue Literatur zur zwinglischen Reformation' is

available not only in printed form (in the yearbook 'Zwingliana'), but also

on the net. URL: <a href=http://www.unizh.ch/irg/biblio.html> http://www.unizh.ch/irg/biblio.html</a>.

<p>

<strong>SHAKESPEARE AND ASTROLOGY</strong><br>

A site exploring how examining Shakespeare's interest in astrology may

provide answers to problems of dating, textual variants, etc. With

particular ref. to Titus Andronicus, Winter's Tale, Antony and Cleopatra,

and Hamlet. The URL is: <a href=http://www.sonnet.co.uk/egma/> http://www.sonnet.co.uk/egma/</a>.

<p>

<strong>WORLD SHAKESPEARE BIBLIO ON CD-ROM</strong><br>

It must be good because it has just been awarded the Besterman Medal, given

by the Library Association (UK) for the year's outstanding bibliography.

This is the first time it has been awarded to an electronic publication.

Full details are available at the World Shakespeare Bibliography website:

<a href=http://www-english.tamu.edu/wsb> http://www-english.tamu.edu/wsb</a>.

<p>

<strong>ERASMUS SOCIETY ON THE WEB</strong><br>

For a description of the Erasmus Of Rotterdam Society's goals and

activities, recent news, and the table of contents of the _Erasmus of

Rotterdam Society Yearbook_ 17 (1997) head for the following URL:

<strong>CRRS (TORONTO) AND FICINO HOMEPAGE</strong><br>

CERES has mentioned the impressive list of resources at the Centre for

Reformation and Renaissance Studies site already. But anywhere with a

picture of a bookwheel can't be mentioned enough:

<a href=http://citd.scar.utoronto.ca/crrs/index.html> http://citd.scar.utoronto.ca/crrs/index.html</a>.  

It also gets a mention now because we can finally tell you where the

homepage of the FICINO discussion group (sponsored by CRRS) is...

<a href=http://citd.scar.utoronto.ca/CRRS/FICINO.html> http://citd.scar.utoronto.ca/CRRS/FICINO.html</a>.

<p>

<strong>CHAPMAN'S ODYSSEY</strong><br>

Project Bartleby at Columbia has one Renaissance text on its list, the 1857

edition of Chapman's Odyssey. Useful, and very nice-looking. URL:

<a href=http://www.columbia.edu/acis/bartleby/chapman/> http://www.columbia.edu/acis/bartleby/chapman/</a>.

<p>

<strong>COMPUTER & LETTEREN (UTRECHT)</strong><br>

The intimidatingly-titled Competence Center for Electronic Document

Engineering has an impressively businesslike and serious site with various

multimedia projects, including emblems, Dutch printers' devices, an

iconographic database, etc. This definitely merits a serious look-through by

a bibliographer, and CERES would be glad to hear of anyone's experiences:

<a href=http://candl.let.ruu.nl/> http://candl.let.ruu.nl/</a>.

<p>

<strong>BIBLIOTHECA AUGUSTANA</strong><br>

Another rather splendid classical website, the incipient Bibliotheca

Augustana is run by Ulrich Harsch, and is devoted to making Latin texts

(ancient, medieval, post-medieval) freely available in electronic form. At

present it includes works by Ambrosius, Boethius,

Comenius, Copernicus, Dante, Descartes, Einhard, Hrotsvitha of Gandersheim,

Isidore, Lactantius, Melanchthon, Morus, Cornelius Nepos, Spinoza,

Theophilus presbyter, Ulfilas and Vergil, and several more are planned

(Caesar, Catullus, Cicero, Diocletianus, Donatus, Francesco of Assisi,

Horace, Livius, Lucrece, Ovid, Petrarca, Sallust, Tacitus). Wot fine lists.

<a href=http://www.fh-augsburg.de/~harsch/augusta.html> http://www.fh-augsburg.de/~harsch/augusta.html</a>.

<p>

For those interested in Dante, the Bibliotheca offers e-texts of the

<cite>Quaestio de acqua et terra</cite>, of the two <cite>Eclogues</cite>, and of <cite>Epistola III</cite> (and a new HTML version of Jim Marchand's e-text of <cite>Epistola XIII</cite>); <cite>De vulgari

eloquentia</cite> will be available shortly.

<p>

<strong>EARLY MODERN LITERARY STUDIES NEW ISSUE</strong><br>

This has finally appeared, heralded by a mighty apologia cross-posted to

many lists CERES members subscribe to. For those who depend only on us,

issue 3.1 is at <a href=http://purl.oclc.org/emls/emlshome.html> http://purl.oclc.org/emls/emlshome.html</a>.  Or the U.K. mirror:

<a href=http://users.ox.ac.uk/~emls/emlshome.html> http://users.ox.ac.uk/~emls/emlshome.html</a>.  The issue includes Steve Sohmer on "12 June 1599: Opening Day at Shakespeare's Globe", Randall Martin on "Isabella Whitney's 'Lamentation upon the death of William Gruffith'", Emma Roth-Schwartz on "Colon and Semi-Colon in Donne's Prose Letters: Practice and Principle", and Jeffrey Kahan on a possible source for Caliban, as well as a host of reviews.

Included alongside issue 3.1 is the first in the EMLS Special Issue Series,

edited by Ian Lancashire and Michael Best, and entitled <cite>New Scholarship

from Old Renaissance Dictionaries: Applications of the Early Modern English

Dictionaries Database</cite>.

<p>

<strong>COPAC UPDATE</strong><br>

COPAC is an internationally accessible catalogue giving unified free access

to some of the largest university research library collections in the UK and

Ireland. A *new release* of COPAC has just been made available containing a

number of changes such as new libraries (incl. The University of London

Library), more local data, and extended search facilities. To access COPAC

you can use the Web Interface at: <a href=http://copac.ac.uk/copac/> http://copac.ac.uk/copac/</a>.  Or the Text Interface using telnet:  <a href=telnet:copac.ac.uk>telnet copac.ac.uk</a>. Username and password are both 'copac'.

<strong>CESARE RIPA'S <cite>ICONOLOGIA</cite></strong><br>

The ORBIS Foundation (the Hungarian centre for computer applications in art

history) is preparing an annotated CD-Rom edition of Cesare Ripa's

<cite>Iconologia</cite>. The first issue (to be published in December 1997) will

comprise: the full text of eight Italian editions of the Iconologia and

every illustration (c. 150 - 400 engravings per edition); a critical

comparison of the Italian editions with notes on textual variants;

comprehensive annotations; the full Hungarian translation of the first

illustrated edition of 1603, with Hungarian footnotes; two English versions

(the full text of the 1709 London edition, and the full text of a hitherto

unpublished 17th century English translation in manuscript (British Library,

MS Add. 23195); an iconographic index on the basis of the ICONCLASS

international iconographic descriptive system; and the full text of all the

cited sources. It will also contain the full text of a number of sources

used by Ripa, including works by Boccaccio, Comes, and Dante.

<p>

Further information and a sample (the article on Avaritia) can be found at

<a href=http://vega.ceu.hu:80/medstud/or/ripa.htm> http://vega.ceu.hu:80/medstud/or/ripa.htm</a>.

<p>

The hypertexts of Ripa's sources will be made freely available on the web;

the first of these texts, Pietro Vasolli da Fivizano's Italian translation

of Horapollon's <cite>Hieroglyphica</cite> (printed by Giolito, Venice 1547), is

already online at:

<a href=http://vega.ceu.hu:80/medstud/or/horap/horapollo.htm> http://vega.ceu.hu:80/medstud/or/horap/horapollo.htm</a>.
