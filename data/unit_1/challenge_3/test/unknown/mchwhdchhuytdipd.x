		<p>Design at the GSA covers a wide spectrum of activity. From the traditional crafts of silversmithing, jewellery design and ceramics to the design of products, interiors, textiles and communication, the diversity of our specialisms is bound together by a common goal - to produce excellent designers.</p><p>We are committed to the development of design education, practice and research, in the highly creative environment of the GSA where artists, designers and architects study and have the opportunity to work together.  Learning and teaching is studio-based, complemented by a programme of Historical and Critical Studies and visiting lecturers, critics and honorary professors.  </p><p>Design School students are successful and a high number go on to postgraduate study at the RCA, while others choose to develop their career in the creative industries with many setting up their own businesses or working for major international companies.  Our students show work annually at New Designers and D&amp;AD in London, at Premier Vision, Paris, and have been invited to exhibit at the Furniture Fair in Milan.</p><p>Our staff are practicing designers as well as academics and are all involved in their own practice and research projects and regularly exhibit internationally and nationally.</p><p>Welcome to the School of Design.</p>
