<B>Objectives and Goals</B>
<P>
To establish a network of European SOM modellers and long-term data holders
and a database system of SOM models and long-term SOM experiments. To promote
coordination of ongoing research, and facilitate collaboration between European
(EU, CEES and NIS) research groups working on the effects of global environmental
change on soil organic matter (SOM). This project compliments the GCTE-<A HREF="http://www.rothamsted.bbsrc.ac.uk/aen/somnet/index.htm">SOMNET</A>
programme, the database for which can be found at
<A HREF="http://saffron.rothamsted.bbsrc.ac.uk/cgi-bin/somnet">http://saffron.rothamsted.bbsrc.ac.uk/cgi-</A>
<A HREF="http://saffron.rothamsted.bbsrc.ac.uk/cgi-bin/somnet">bin/somnet</A>.
<P>
<B>Project Methodology</B>
<P>
This project will establish a) a <U>network</U> of European SOM modellers
and long-term data holders, and b) a <U>database</U> system of SOM models
and long-term SOM experiments. The network and underpinning database system
will cover EU member states and other western European countries (e.g.
Switzerland), and extend to the central and east european states (CEES),
and the newly independent states of the former Soviet Union (NIS). The general
approach to acheive these goals will entail:
<OL>
  <LI>
    Establishing a Network of European SOM modellers and data holders which will
    allow project partners to: a) share state- of-the-art methodologies and knowledge
    in the field of modelling the effects of global change on SOM relevant to
    Europe, and b) identify gaps and research priorities in SOM model development
    with respect the global change to help meet EU objectives.
  <LI>
    Building a database of SOM models and long-term SOM experiments which will
    entail: a) identifying datasets within Europe (EU, CEES and NIS) for inclusion
    in EuroSOMNET, b) standardising the European datasets - this will mean devising
    an agreed standard data format, c) developing methodologies and protocols
    for the quality control of datasets made available within the EuroSOMNET,
    and d) building a central electronic EuroSOMNET database and linking this
    database to regional network sites (in CEES and NIS) and electronic databases
    at individual sites.
</OL>
<P>
The work content will comprise the following activities:
<OL>
  <LI>
    Establishment of a central co-ordinating network site, an electronic bulletin
    board and a list server (at Rothamsted)
  <LI>
    Establishment of the three regional networks (EU, CEES and NIS)
  <LI>
    Establishment of the EuroSOMNET electronic database system, formation of
    regional databases, collection of data in standard network format, and data
    quality control
  <LI>
    Regional summaries, regional analysis and project reports
  <LI>
    Encourage and facilitate collaboration with researchers globally
  <LI>
    Publications
</OL>
<P>
Further details of each of these activities is provided below:
<P>
In order to provide a central contact point, an electronic bulletin board
and list server for EuroSOMNET will be established. These will be used to
exchange ideas and current findings, to aid bilateral and multilateral
collaboration within the Network, and to inform members of forthcoming meetings
etc.
<P>
The central site will also mount and maintain the EuroSOMNET central database
which will contain summaries of all data available at the regional network
co-ordination sites (see below). The site will be accessible via the
World-Wide-Web, and a series of web pages will give the user both information
and access to other data-holding sites. Any database tools developed by network
participants (see below) will also be mounted here to be downloaded by interested
parties.
<P>
Within the three regions (EU, CEES, and NIS), regional co- ordinators have
identified most of the sites that will contribute to the network. More will
inevitably come to light during the period of this project. Some of these
sites will already have electronic databases containing data (and models
used) from their long-term experiments and for these sites it will simply
be a matter of participants formatting their data in the standard network
format. This can be acheived relatively easily at individual sites. Network
participants will also be asked to complete an electronic / hard-copy
questionnaire to provide detailed information on the long-term data or SOM
model they are contributing to the network. This information will then be
stored on the central EuroSOMNET database in the UK but copies will be available
at regional co- ordinating sites and at individual participant's sites.
<P>
Where technically possible (i.e. where an Internet connection exists), and
where network participants wish to make their data more widely available
for use by other workers (e.g. when it has been previously published), network
participant site databases will be linked to regional co-ordinating site
databases and the central database. The timetable of this part depends upon
when funds can be secured from other sources to fund hardware and technical
support to aid in establishing the information technology-based aspects (computer
networking for East-West collaboration) of this proposal.
<P>
A EuroSOMNET database system will be constructed during the course of the
project, using contributions from regional networks in EU, CEES and NIS.
The database system will comprise: a) a central electronic EuroSOMNET metadata
database (containing detailed information on each experiment / model
participating in the network), b) a central electronic database (of actual
data) of European long-term SOM datasets and SOM models for sites that wish
to make models/data freely available, c) regional network databases (from
EU, CEES and NIS), individual site databases of models and data in standard
SOMNET format linked to the central database via the Internet [World-Wide-Web],
gopher or FTP.
<P>
Individual network participants will assemble their data in the standard
format and where appropriate, individual site databases will be linked to
the sites of regional network partners or to the central EuroSOMNET database
(either via the Internet [World-Wide-Web], gopher of FTP protocols depending
on technology available at each site). Agreed quality control criteria will
be applied by individual participants to their own datasets but lateral
cross-checks to ensure parity in quality will be made at the regional network
level. Indicators of data and model quality can then be attached to the metadata
database entries and to the actual datasets (and models) held at individual
network sites. Database tools written by partners (e.g. routines for converting
standard data to the format required for particular SOM models) will also
be made available via the central database system.
<P>
Project reports will be produced at the end of each year. A final project
report will include regional data summaries (data synthesis) and a regional
analysis (interpretation) of the data. Publications arising from use of the
database (e.g. model evaluation, regional carbon sequestration potential
estimates etc.) will be summarised in the final report and a full bibliography
will be provided.
<P>
Publications arising from the regional summaries (data synthesis) and regional
analyses (data interpretation) will be published in peer-reviewed scientific
journals. When published, these summaries and analysis will also be published
in electronic format to accompany the data held on the WWW electronic database.

</OL>
<P>
The development of the three regional networks will not be dependent upon
the rate of development in other regions. After the initial project meeting
to agree common questionnaires, data formats and quality control criteria,
the development of each regional network will then be able to progress
independently (but with a common structure). The final linked database (linking
all regional databases) does, however, depend upon the successful completion
of each regional network.
<P>
  <hr />
<P>
<B><BIG>COMPLEMENTARY PROJECTS</BIG></B>
<P>
Although the success of this project does not rely upon the outcome of any
other, it will contribute significantly to other EU-funded projects. EuroSOMNET
will provide access to models and datasets that will be invaluable for two
other EU- funded projects in particular. The ETEMA (European Terrestrial
Ecosystem Modelling Activity) project (Contract: ENV4-CT95- 0052; Proposal:
PL950995) co-ordinated by Prof. I. Colin Prentice of Lund University (Sweden)
with input from PIK- Potsdam (Germany), ENS-Paris (France), Kings College
London (UK), University of Sheffield (UK), ITE-NERC-Edinburgh (UK) and
MTV-IRSA-EC (Italy) will benefit from access to data and models made available
by EuroSOMNET. MAGEC (PL971038), also co- ordinated by this project's
co-ordinator, Dr Pete Smith of Rothamsted (UK), with partners from
PIK-Potsdam (Germany), and AB-DLO (The Netherlands) will also benefit from
access to data and models made available by EuroSOMNET. There is no
interdependence among these projects, but EuroSOMNET will provide a significant
resource that will aid progress in the soils aspects of these projects.
<P>
EuroSOMNET will also provide added value to other ongoing EU- funded research
into SOM, as well as providing a focus and a resource for this work. We will
solicit contributions to EuroSOMNET from other SOM researchers in the EU
(and other western European states), CEES and NIS.
