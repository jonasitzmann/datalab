<P>The sub-department's research focuses on the study of physical
processes in the atmospheres and oceans of the Earth and other
planets, using experimental and theoretical techniques.  We have about
70 members, including 10 permanent academic or research staff, about
20 post-doctoral researchers and senior visitors, and about 30
graduate students.

<P>Our main area of experimental work is the development of space
instruments for infrared remote sensing of the structure and
composition of planetary atmospheres, especially the Earth's
stratosphere and mesosphere. Nine of these instruments are already in
space: seven in Earth orbit, one orbiting Venus, one orbiting Jupiter,
and another on the way to Saturn.  Two unsuccessful attempts in 1992
and 1999 to orbit Mars and study its present and past climate are to
be followed in 2005 by a new instrument on the NASA  Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter. Several new space experiments are under development,
including Earth-orbiting remote sensors to form part of the NASA Earth
Observing System, which is investigating global change, and new
missions to Venus, Mars and Mercury.  Extensive overseas and domestic
collaborations are involved, with industrial and scientific centres in
Europe and the USA.

<P>We are an important centre for theoretical atmospheric and oceanic
modelling.  Our climate dynamics group studies the large-scale
behaviour of the atmosphere-ocean system and its response to external
drivers such as the increases in greenhouse gas levels responsible for
anthropogenic climate change. Other modelling of the Earth's
atmosphere focuses on large-scale dynamical and chemical-transport
processes relevant to climate, and on the interpretation of our
satellite data.  We also use dynamical models of other planets,
including Mars and Jupiter, to interpret existing data and help plan
new observational missions.  We also investigate fundamental
geophysical fluid dynamics by means of laboratory experiments on
rotating, stratified fluids, and also study the chaotic behaviour of a
wide variety of physical systems using experimental and theoretical
techniques.
