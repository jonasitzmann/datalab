<h2>Description of Collimator-Monochromator System (CMS)</h2>

<p>The collimator-monochromator system was constructed for the HIRDLS
field of view (FOV) and spectral calibration. It consists of an
<b>off-axis parabaloid</b> (clear aperture 280 mm diameter) imaging
either a <b>hot point/structured source</b> contained within the broadband
hot source assembly (BBHSA), or the exit slit of a <b>monochromator</b>. A
flip mirror is used to change the focus of the paraboloid between
these different sources.</p>

<p>The BBHSA consists of a substrate heater, the surface of which was
thermostatted at temperatures of up to 1100 K during HIRDLS
calibration, illuminating a set of apertures. These were photo-etched
into a beryllium-copper foil and mounted within a cone-shaped
blackbody cavity. The part of the BBHSA viewed by HIRDLS - the
faceplate, cone and the blackened face of the foil - were cooled by
liquid nitrogen to a temperature of about 260 K. A shutter was
employed to chop the radiation incident on the apertures.</p>

</td><td> 

<p>The design of the monochromator is shown in Fig 3. It consists of a
diffraction grating in a Czerny-Turner configuration with a focal
length of 600 mm (distance from the exit spherical mirror to the exit
slit). A Bentham turret is included to provide a choice of four
gratings, depending on the desired wavelength range. The exit beam of
the monochromator was alternately directed towards HIRDLS or a
calibration detector.</p>

<p>The purpose of the monochromator was to measure the spectral
responses of each of the 21 HIRDLS detectors and to characterize any
small out-of-band responses.</p>

<p>The BBHSA was designed to measure the spatial responses of each of
the HIRDLS detectors, at high spatial resolution and also at lower
resolution with increased sensitivity to measure any small
out-of-field spatial response. The coalignment of each of the
detectors was also accurately determined.

<p>The <a href="mass_3.html">low-vibration performance</a> of the
calibration facility allowed good characterization of the HIRDLS field
of view, exemplified by Fig 5. The relative response of HIRDLS channel
18 to radiation from an atmospheric limb view is plotted (a detector
corresponds approximately to 1 km in height by 10 km horizontally in the
atmosphere).</p> 

<p>Part of a jitter power spectrum recorded with the seismic block
floated is shown in Fig 5. The RMS jitter measured here was an order of
magnitude better than the requirement.</p> </td></tr>
