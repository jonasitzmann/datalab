<h2>Thermometric Calibration</h2>

<p>An essential component of blackbody design and integration is the accurate,
end-to-end calibration of the resistance thermometer devices (RTDs) used to
sense temperature. Ideally, the calibration should be performed on the
blackbody, the blackbody electronics and the interconnecting harness as
a complete assembly, particularly if the RTDs have been surface mounted or
encapsulated using adhesives or potting compounds (typical for
space-engineered components). The CTE mismatch between the sensor, the
substrate and the bonding or potting material will induce stress, and
therefore strain, in the restrained RTDs, resulting in shifts in the
resistance-versus-temperature curves as sensors are temperature cycled.
Thermal conditioning and the judicious choice of retraining material can do
much to minimise these shifts, making accurate, long-term calibration
possible, but extremely time-consuming. </p>

<p>It should be noted that for space-engineered blackbodies, the time
interval between thermometric calibration and launch could be as much
as 4 years with an additional 5 to 10 years of operational life on
orbit. In addition, the thermometers and their conditioning and
read-out electronics must be able to survive high levels of shock and
vibration and the hostile environment of space, all without undergoing
a shift in calibration.</p>

<p>The design requirements for the <a
href="../capabilities/blackbodies.html">HIRDLS
In-flight Calibration Blackbody, IFCBB</a> specified 10&#160;mK absolute
accuracy at the point of calibration, with shifts of no more than 5&#160;mK
per year and with traceability back to ITS90. This exacting
specification was met through the application of rigorous sensor
procurement, conditioning and selection procedures prior to blackbody
integration. The assembled blackbody was then 'thermally conditioned'
and thermometrically calibrated as a single unit (including the flight
harness) in the cryostat shown in Fig 1.  <TABLE WIDTH=100%

<p>The cryostat, which has an operational temperature range from 200 K
to 345 K (cooled with a Huber refrigeration unit), has been used on a
number of occasions to calibrate temperatures sensors or small
blackbodies, or a combination of both. The thermometer block used to
calibrate the blackbody targets and sea water temperature probes for
the <a
href="http://www.atsr.rl.ac.uk/validation/sister/sis_inst/index.shtml">SISTeR
calibration campaign</a> is shown in Fig 2, with the assembled block,
prior to installing in the cryostat, shown in Fig 3. The block was
fitted with a Tinsley gas-filled PRT (P/N 5187L) calibrated at NPL to
ITS90. A similar arrangement, involving a purpose-built thermometer
block, was used to calibrate the HIRDLS in-flight calibrator
blackbody.</p> <TABLE WIDTH=100% CELLPADDING="5%"><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP>

<p>The cryostat was also used to calibrate meteorological sensors for the
<a href="http://www.beagle2.com/index.htm">BEAGLE 2 Mars
Lander</a>. The payload includes two air temperature sensors and an
Oxford-designed <a
href="../../user/wilson/B2WS/">wind sensor</a>. The
air temperature sensors and the resistance-temperature dependence of
the anemometer films were calibrated in the cryostat, Fig
4. Aerodynamic calibration of the wind sensor was performed in a <a
href="../../user/wilson/matacf.html">low density
wind tunnel</a>, which is located at the Department of Engineering
Science, Oxford University.</p>

<p>In addition to the cryostat for small blackbodies, the department
has acquired a second, LHe-cooled cryostat with a working temperature
range from 1.5&#160;K to 300&#160;K. The cryostat, the rewiring and
recommisioning of whcih is shown in Fig&#160;5, is used to calibrate
4-wire cryogenic resistance thermometers, such as the 27&#160;ohm
ceramic rhodium-iron resistance thermometers (RIRTs) used for <a
href="2point2_metre_facility/targets_5.html">HIRDLS radiometric test and
calibration</a>. The department's a.c. resistance bridges, resistance
standards and other thermometry test equipment are listed below. The
LHe cryostat's thermometer block also has two Tinsley 5187L capsule
gas-filled PRTs and two Tinsley 5187U capsule gas-filled RIRTs. These
will require recalibration before the cryostat can be considered
operational.</p>
