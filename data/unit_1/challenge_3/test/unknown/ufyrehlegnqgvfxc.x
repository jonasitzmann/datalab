        Research Proposals and Funding Applications </h1>
      <p>The following remarks are intended to help those applying for a place 
        to study for the Ph.D., as well as those applying for a place on one of 
        the Faculty&#8217;s M.Phil. courses. They are also intended to help with 
        subsequent applications to funding bodies. For further details on available 
        funding see &#8216;<a href="http://www.english.cam.ac.uk/postgraduate/Funding.htm">Funding 
        for Home and EU Students</a>&#8217; or &#8216;<a href="http://www.english.cam.ac.uk/postgraduate/OSFunding.htm">Funding 
        for Overseas Students</a>&#8217;. More particular information on the <strong>AHRC</strong> 
        application process is included below; this may also be of assistance 
        to those applying to other funding bodies.</p>
      <h2>The Research Proposal </h2>
      <p>Your research proposal should be 500 words long. It needs to give those 
        assessing your application an impression of the strength and originality 
        of your proposed research, and its potential to make a contribution to 
        knowledge. It should be written in clear, jargon-free, and unexceptionable 
        prose. Grammatical mistakes and typographical errors give a very bad impression. 
        You should make sure you cover the following areas (without explicitly 
        dividing the proposal into headings):<br />
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong> the research topic</strong><br />
          briefly outline the area and topic of your research</li>
        <li><strong>the research context</strong><br />
          relate your proposed research to other work in its field or related 
          fields, and indicate in what ways your research will differ; you might 
          mention monographs on the subject, as well as important theoretical 
          models or methodological exemplars: this is a chance to show your understanding 
          of the background against which your research will be defined</li>
        <li><strong> the contribution you will make</strong><br />
          this is your chance to show how you have arrived at your position and 
          recognised the need for your research, and what it is that makes it 
          both new and important; you should indicate what areas and debates it 
          will have an impact on, what methodological example it sets (if appropriate) 
          &#8211; in short how it contributes to knowledge and to the practice 
          of our subject. Give examples of the sort of evidence you might consider, 
          and of the questions it might help you to raise. Show that you are already 
          thinking about the area in detail and not only in outline.</li>
        <li><strong> your methods</strong><br />
          in some cases there will be little to say here, but if there is something 
          striking about your methodology, you should explain it</li>
        <li> <strong>the sources and resources you will use</strong><br />
          you should delimit your field of enquiry, showing where the project 
          begins and ends; in certain cases, Cambridge will have unique collections 
          and resources of central relevance to your project, and you should mention 
          these</li>
        <li> <strong>how the project will develop</strong><br />
          you might indicate some of the possible ways in which the project could 
          develop, perhaps by giving a broader or narrower version depending on 
          what materials and issues you uncover <br />
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>It is vital that you show that your research is necessary. It is not 
        enough that it happens to interest you. You should make clear that it 
        will be of use and interest to others working in your field, or on a particular 
        author, or indeed in neighbouring fields. You should show how your work 
        will make a contribution to knowledge and to the practice of our subject.</p>
      <h2>AHRC Applications </h2>
      <p>The application forms for AHRC awards include detailed notes on how to 
        fill in the form. You should not be put off by the length of these notes, 
        or imagine that you can do without reading them. They are clear, practical, 
        and helpful, and following their guidance will maximise your chances of 
        getting an award. It is especially important that you leave plenty of 
        time for preparing your application, discussing it with your prospective 
        supervisor, and redrafting it in the light of comments received. Only 
        25% of applications to the AHRC are successful, so it is vital that you 
        make as good a job as you possibly can of your application. It is also 
        vital that you submit the form to the Faculty in plenty of time, as we 
        have to fill in quite a substantial part of the form and this takes time.</p>
      <p>A number of things should be stressed. The AHRC want to know why they 
        should support this student, to work on this project, in this Faculty, 
        and under this supervisor. It is vital therefore that the project be a 
        good fit both with the research strengths of the Faculty (and, for interdisciplinary 
        projects, neighbouring faculties and research centres) and with the interests 
        and research activity of the supervisor. Ph.D. applicants in particular 
        are therefore advised to make contact with the prospective supervisor, 
        and talk to him or her about the project and how best to present it to 
        the AHRC. This may necessitate some remodelling of the project, and this 
        is to be encouraged. If we have given you a place to study here, then 
        we want to do everything we can to help you get funding. So don&#8217;t 
        be shy about asking us for help.</p>
      <p><strong>M.Phil. applicants</strong> must apply under the &#8216;<strong>Research 
        Preparation Master&#8217;s Scheme</strong>&#8217;. Applicants under the 
        &#8216;Professional Preparation Master&#8217;s Scheme&#8217; are unlikely 
        to be successful, since our M.Phil. courses are defined as research-preparation 
        courses. It does not matter if you have applied to us as &#8216;M.Phil. 
        only&#8217; instead of &#8216;M.Phil. in the first instance&#8217;. For 
        one thing, it is very simple to change status once you arrive. For another, 
        you may wish to undertake your doctoral research elsewhere. The AHRC&#8217;s 
        notes give detailed advice on how to fill in the form, and our only advice 
        is that in the section where you are invited to make a case for support 
        you should cover both the taught and research elements of the M.Phil. 
        courses. Include a reasonably detailed research proposal, since the dissertation 
        makes up a substantial proportion of the M.Phil. as a whole, as well as 
        giving details about the course and your route through it. Don&#8217;t 
        just parrot our own literature, but show how you envisage a coherent year 
        of study that will lead to subsequent doctoral research, making clear 
        what that doctoral research will be on.</p>
      <p><strong>Ph.D. applicants</strong> apply under the &#8216;<strong>Doctoral 
        Awards Scheme</strong>&#8217;. Again, you will see from the AHRC&#8217;s 
        notes that you are advised to discuss your application with your prospective 
        supervisor. You will see from the rest of the form that both your referees 
        and the Faculty need to comment on various aspects of your application 
        and qualifications. Don&#8217;t be shy of giving us information which 
        will help fill in these sections effectively.</p>
      <p>If you have any questions about the application process or funding, please 
        get in touch with us.</p>
