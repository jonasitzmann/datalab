<h3>Vortex dynamics and data assimilation.</h3>

<a href="vdyn.html">Simple models</a> of large scale flows have been 
used extensively to help in the interpretation of flow features observed
in the atmosphere. As the range and volume of observations increases
it is becoming possible to combine the models and the observations
in a statistically optimised way, to obtain a "best estimate" of
the actual flow state. There are, however, many problems to be solved
concerning the ways in which the complex error characteristics of the models
and observations are treated. By using a heirarchy of simple models
it is hoped that some progress addressing these problems may be made.

<h3>The dynamics of the tropopause in mid-latitudes on synoptic scales.
</h3>

In this region and range of scales atmospheric flow is
close to geostrophic balance. 
Quasigeostrophic tropopause (QGT) dynamics exploits this fact to
give an approximate description of the dynamics of the tropopause.
QGT has been used to investigate the instability of upper
tropospheric shear lines and the mean meridional mass flux in the
lower stratosphere.

The evolution of the tropopause potential temperature reveals the
complex interactions of weather systems on a wide range of scales.

<h3>Baroclinic instability</h3>

Continuing the analysis of balanced synoptic scale flow, some of the
results obtained in the study of upper tropospheric shear lines have been
applied to the problem of baroclinic waves. These waves are responsible for
the transport of large amounts of heat from the subtropics to higher
latitudes.
For waves growing on narrow baroclinic zones it is found that the
normal mode growth rate is proportional to the horizontal change
in temperature across the front divided by the change in
potential temperature between the surface and the tropopause.

<p>
The study of broad baroclinic zones reveals a range of parameters
for which a critical line plays an active part in the normal mode.

<h3>The mass flux across the tropopause </h3>

The stratosphere and troposphere are two air masses with a range
of contrasting properties. Theoretical work has shown that there
is a net transfer of mass from the troposphere into the stratosphere
at high latitudes. Ongoing work will seek to quantify this mass
transfer by applying the theory analyses of atmospheric data.
