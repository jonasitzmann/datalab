  <h1 align="center">About the English Faculty<a id="#About_the_English_Faculty" 
name="#About_the_English_Faculty"></a></h1>
  <p><img src="images/front.jpg" width="225" height="290" align="left" alt="Photo of the Entrance to the Faculty" hspace="5" />The English Faculty was founded in 1919. It was the first Faculty in the country to encourage the study of English Literature up until the present day and the first to approach English literature from a 'literary' point of view, rather than as a manifestation of the history of the language. Founders of the method of practical criticism, including I.A. Richards, William Empson and F.R. Leavis were members of the Faculty in its early years, and made a lasting impression on how literature is studied today. The Faculty today still attaches great importance to the ability to read literary texts closely and attentively. The undergraduate course still includes literature from 1300 up to the present day (with optional courses on earlier periods), and many of our students are actively involved in creative writing. The Faculty also provides opportunities to work on literature from a large number of contemporary perspectives: there are optional papers in Part II which take account of the recent expansion of 'English' literature to include commonwealth and post-colonial writing, and which invite students to consider the role played by literary theory. Throughout the course students are encouraged to think about connections between English literature and a wider context of European writing. This aspect of students' work may begin with the foreign language paper in Part I (which is optional) and culminate in the Tragedy paper in Part II, which covers a range of material from ancient Greek tragedy to twentieth century films.</p>
  <p>Graduates from the Faculty have an exceptionally good record in achieving employment in a wide range of areas. Some have moved on to professions which are not directly related to the subject (the law, accountancy); many have become journalists or writers or actors. Some have become teachers, some jazz pianists. The Faculty aims to enable its students to learn how to read critically and argue independently and lucidly. These qualities are valuable to employers; they are also, more importantly, valuable for living.</p>
  <p>The Faculty has a large number of members, and embraces a large number of different areas of expertise and approaches to literary criticism. There are practising poets and novelists among the Faculty's members, and each year there is a visiting fellow in the creative or performing arts. <a 
href="../faculty/index.htm">The members of the Faculty</a> teach and do research in almost every aspect of literature in English.</p>
  <p>The experience of reading English at Cambridge is particularly rich because the course combines Lectures and Seminars provided by the Faculty with close teaching (Supervision) organized by the Colleges -- for details see the next section. The choice of which College to apply to will depend on such incidental issues as your taste in architecture. The best way to find out about <a 
href="http://www.cam.ac.uk/CambUniv/Finding/Addresses/college.html" 
target="_top">Colleges</a> is to send off for prospectuses and/or attend Open Days. The majority of Colleges have made their prospectuses available on the World-Wide Web.</p>
