<p>
Computer simulators are an important source of information when we
  make predictive statements about future climate.  If our predictive
  statements are to be probabilistic, we need to construct a joint
  probability distribution over evaluations of the simulator and the
  climate itself.  In other words, we must quantify the way in which
  the climate simulator is informative about the climate.  This paper
  outlines a `minimal' probabilistic framework for linking these two
  things, which should be sufficiently general to accommodate a wide
  variety of computer-based climate predictions.  Within the context
  of the proposed link, a popular current approach is shown to be
  over-restrictive.
