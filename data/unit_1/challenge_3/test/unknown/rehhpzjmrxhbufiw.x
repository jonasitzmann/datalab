Abstract:
</H4>

<p>
This talk will review recent work by Mineev-Weinstein, Wiegmann
and Zabrodin relating the Laplacian growth problem governing the
moving boundary between two fluids trapped in a Hele-Shaw cell and
the dispersionless limit of integrable Hamiltonian hierarchies. The dynamics 
will also be related to the changes in the leading term large N asymptotics of 
the eigenvalue distribution of random normal N x N matrices induced by 
deformations in the probability measure.
