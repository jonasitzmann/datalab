<p>
The theory of wave-kinetics is a new approach to the study of the propagation
of broadband, incoherent waves in dispersive media. Where the classical
approach to wave-driven processes restricts itself mainly to monochromatic
waves coupling to other monochromatic waves, the wave-kinetic approach allows
one to study the coupling of random and/or broadband pump waves coupling to
monochromatic or coherent structures in the medium. The list of phenomena that
can be studied through this approach is very long, reaching from
laser-wakefield studies to lower-hybrid drift wave studies, turbulence in
planetary atmospheres, and even neutrino-driven shock waves in collapsing
stars. 

We have developed a particle-in-cell type numerical code based on the
wave-kinetic principles, and it has already been applied successfully to
a range of problems in laser-plasma interaction and drift wave-zonal flow
interaction. Some results of these studies will be shown to demonstrate the
capabilities of the code.

There exists a striking similarity between the equations describing drift
modes coupling to zonal flows, and those describing Rossby waves coupling to
zonal flows. This similarity indicates that we should be able to treat Rossby
wave turbulence in a fashion similar to drift waves. We will explore these
similarities, and discuss what the results already obtained for drift waves
can tell us about Rossby waves.
