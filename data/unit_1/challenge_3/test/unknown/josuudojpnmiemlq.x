<p class="blue center"><strong>Tameside, situated between Manchester city centre and the Peak District - offers an excellent career to innovative and forward-looking staff.</strong> </p>
<p>In this year's annual Comprehensive Performance Assessment, Tameside is the only council in the North West to receive the top rating of four stars, with a judgement of 'improving strongly' - a rating given to only a handful of authorities nationally</p>
<p>Tameside provides a mix of urban and rural living, with the peace and quiet of the countryside minutes from vibrant night-life and culture. It's a friendly and hard-working place. Inward investment is at an all-time high and the council has won many awards for its customer service and innovative web-based technology.</p>
<p>Tameside Council is innovative and ambitious - independent inspectors recognise that. Audit Commission inspectors said Tameside is &quot;improving faster than any other council in the country&quot;. We're a learning organisation. Partnership is our watchword. Tameside has a culture of innovation and performance and with the political stability of the council, councillors and staff have been able to develop the council's potential together. We are rightly proud of our achievements to date. But we're hungry for more success.</p>
<p>The Council is currently carrying out a Pay &amp; Grading review. Implementation should occur during 2007. This could mean the grades for jobs and other associated conditions may change.</p>
<p>Tameside Council is committed to safeguarding and promoting the welfare of children and young people and requires all staff and volunteers to adhere to this commitment.</p>
<h3 class="center italic">Join us - and be ambitious too!</h3>
