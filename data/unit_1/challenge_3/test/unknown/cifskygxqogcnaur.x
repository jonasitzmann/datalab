Abstract:
</H4>

<p>
We investigate the stability of a zonal jet aligned with zonal topography, on
the
barotropic beta-plane. The topography is assumed to be spatially periodic, with
the
period being much smaller than the width of the jet. The problem is examined by
means
of linear normal-mode analysis and direct numerical simulation of the nonlinear
governing equation.
