<a name="one"><h3><i>What's the difference between climate change and global warming?</i></h3></a>

<p>Climate change and global warming refer to exactly the same process/problem - it's only a matter of exact definition. It is generally accepted that as we continue to emit harmful greenhouse gases into the atmosphere, we can accept average global temperatures to rise. However, some area will see different climatic changes than others eg incresed rainfall, droughts, and even a drop in temperatures. Therefore climate change is a more accurate description of what is hapening.



<a name="two"><h3><i>What causes the climate to change?</i></h3></a>

<p>The solar energy that comes to Earth from the sun drives the Earth's climate. To balance this influx of energy, heat escapes from the Earth back into space as infrared radiation. Certain gases are transparent to the incoming solar energy, and let it pass through on its way to the Earth's surface. However, when this radiation is reemitted from the Earth at longer wavelengths, these same gases absorb a large proportion of it, and prevent it from escaping. Ultimately this has the same effect as a glass greenhouse, and raises the Earth's surface temperature.
<p>Life on Earth relies upon this process occurring, keeping the Earth much warmer than planets with no atmospheric greenhouse gases, so a natural amount of these gases is essential. However, we have gradually been adding too much of these gases artificially, causing the Earth's climate to change.

<p>The chief greenhouse gas is carbon dioxide which contributes 60% to the 'enhanced greenhouse effect'.



<a name="three"><h3><i>Where do the greenhouse gases come from?</i></h3></a>

<p>CO<sub>2</sub> is released by combustion of hydrocarbons, mainly fossil fuels such as coal, gas and oil. Transport vehicles and power stations are the chief burners of these fuels, casuing the greatest of the CO<sub>2</sub> emmissions.

<p>Deforestation and urban spraul means there are less trees and planets to absorb the CO<sub>2</sub> and create oxygen.



<a name="four"><h3><i>Is the climate really changing?</i></h3></a>

<p>Weeather data shows that the average global tmeperature is up by between 0.3 and 0.6 <sup>o</sup>C since 1860.

<p>Water expands as it is heated - in the last 100 years, the average sea level worldwide has risen by 10 to 25cm.

<p> The warmer temperatures are also causing the icy, glacier peaks around mountains to melt. In some places they are losing about 75m per year around the mountain ice-cap.


<a name="five"><h3><i>How serious will it become?</i></h3></a>

<p>If the current levels of greenhouse gas emission continue, then there is expected to be an average global warming of 2 <sup>o</sup> between 1990 and 2100. This may seem onlt a small change over a long time, but, but it would have a drastic impact on many ecosystems and habitats around the world.
