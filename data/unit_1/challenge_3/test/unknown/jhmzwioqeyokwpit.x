      <h1 align="center">The Ph.D.</h1>
      <p>The Ph.D is a research degree, examined, usually after three or more 
        years of research, by a dissertation of up to 80,000 words. The criteria 
        for obtaining the degree are that the dissertation represent a 'substantial 
        contribution to knowledge' and that it also represent a realistic amount 
        of work for three years' study.</p>
      <p>Candidates work closely with their supervisors, who will usually be
        assigned to them at the start of the course. It is possible to change
        supervisors
        with minimal formality, and it is often desirable to do so as the research
        project develops. The Faculty of English makes every attempt to ensure
        continuity of supervision so that graduate students are able to complete
        their programmes under the guidance of the supervisor with whom they
        begin. Nonetheless, periods of academic leave and departures to posts
        elsewhere are a standard feature of university life and are not always
        possible to foresee in the medium term. In such cases a change of supervisor
        may be necessary.The Faculty has also introduced a system whereby each
        candidate has an advisor in addition to their supervisor, whom they will
        see once a year for a formal review of progress, and more often, if desired,
        for informal advice.</p>
      <p>Although Ph.D. students spend long hours working independently, they 
        are also able to attend regular (usually fortnightly) seminars in their 
        subject area. All graduate students are required to be members of a College, 
        which offers a centre of social activity, as well as providing an opportunity 
        to meet graduates who work in other fields.</p>
      <p>All members of the University, including graduate students, are entitled 
        to attend lectures in any Faculty.</p>
      <p>Candidates are normally accepted for the Ph.D. on a probationary basis, 
        and it is usually necessary to register formally for the Ph.D. a year 
        or so after admission. A substantial essay towards a chapter of the dissertation 
        is examined by two experts in the field. This procedure is designed to 
        ensure that candidates are on course for submission of their dissertation 
        after a total of three or four years. </p>
      <p>Applicants for the Ph.D. who plan to work on a subject area in which 
        the Faculty provides an M.Phil. course, and who have not previously taken 
        an M.Phil., M.A. or similar research foundation course, are required to 
        take the relevant M.Phil. before they are registered for the Ph.D. Candidates 
        who have taken an equivalent M.Phil. or M.A. course already are normally 
        given a dispensation from this requirement. The Director of Graduate Studies 
        will be happy to answer queries about this matter. We have a separate 
        page for Graduate students wishing to work on <a href="Post-1830_Info.htm">literary 
        subjects in the post-1830 period where the same criteria for admission 
        to the Ph.D. apply</a>.</p>
      <p>In reaching decisions about applications the Degree Committee takes particular 
        account of: </p>
      <ul>
        <li>The applicant's academic record and references </li>
        <li>Their suitability for the proposed course (including knowledge of 
          foreign languages) </li>
        <li>The applicant's research proposal - in particular whether it represents 
          a realistic area of study for completion within three years. </li>
        <li>Whether a suitable supervisor can be found for the proposed research 
        </li>
        <li>The written work which a candidate submits in support of their application 
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>Applications must be accompanied by a writing sample of 5,000 - 7,500 
        words. Applicants can submit any work they like, but it is worth choosing 
        work which is recent, and which relates to the proposed subject of research, 
        if material of this kind is available. It is probably more important, 
        however, to submit what you consider to be your best work than something 
        which is not your best, but is close to your field of research. Many applicants 
        submit their undergraduate dissertation or similar extended piece of work.</p>
      <p>If you have a particular subject of research in mind, you might wish 
        to visit the list of <a href="../faculty/index.htm">Members of the Faculty</a> 
        to see who might be an appropriate supervisor for you. Members of the 
        Faculty may be able to help with enquiries from potential graduate students 
        in their own field.</p>
      <p>There isn't a deadline for applications; however, it is recommended that 
        applications are sent in before 15th January if you are intending to come 
        up on 1 October. </p>
      <p>Home students who hope to be funded by the Arts and Humanities Research 
        Council should be aware that they need to have been accepted for a course 
        <b>before</b> they apply for a grant, so it is wise to apply early. Once 
        accepted, they should endeavour to contact their prospective supervisor 
        to refine their research proposal for the AHRC application process.</p>
      <p>Home students should also be aware that, on recent form, it is <b><font color="#ff0000">very 
        difficult indeed</font></b> to be awarded a three year full A.H.R.C. grant 
        without having first taken an M.Phil. or similar one year foundation course.<b> 
        If you do propose to make an application of this kind, you are strongly 
        advised to insure yourself by also applying for a one year course and 
        a one year grant.</b></p>
      <p>All potential applicants should be aware that in order to be finally 
        accepted for the course it is necessary to be accepted <b>both </b>by 
        the Faculty <b>and </b>by a College. This can favour those who make early 
        applications. </p>
