<a name="intro"><P><h3>Introduction</h3></a>

<P>In addition to striving to maintain a high and varied level of scientific
activity, at a time of great external uncertainty, the subdepartment has
actively supported the development of its subject area in other institutions
and also sought to be responsive to government directives on liasing more
closely with industry.  Tangible early examples of the latter are our founder
membership of the Smith Institute for Industrial Mathematics, based in
Guildford, and of the New Sun Foundation of the World Meteorological
Organisation in Geneva.  The former is building links between academia and
industry in the UK, and the latter in the third world.

<P> Space experiments continue to be the mainstay of the
subdepartment's activities and, in addition to the current projects
reported below, considerable effort has been contributed to the
possibilities of new Mars missions, including the European
INTERMARSNET and a reflight of NASA's Mars Observer, a European comet
rendezvous mission (ROSETTA), studies of a Mercury orbiter with Venus
atmospheric probes, and Pluto Fast Flyby and Venus Environmental
Satellite studies for NASA's Discovery programme.  For Earth
Observations, the most interesting future opportunities are the MOPITT
and TES tropospheric pollution sensors, and the MASTER and SOPRANO
advanced microwave sensors, all of which have been the subject of
development studies..

<P> The Atmospheric Physics Laboratory was mercifully free of building
work for the first time in years, but plans to remodel part of the
first floor (to accommodate, <i>inter alia</i>, new facilities for the
increasing number of women in the subdepartment), the ground floor, to
accommodate the test facility for HIRDLS, and to add a new storey to
the top of the building, made progress and all are planned to start
next year.

<a name="earth"><P><h3>Space Experiments - Earth Observations</h3></a>

<P>The Improved Stratospheric and Mesospheric Sounder (ISAMS) which
was launched on the Upper Atmosphere Research Satellite in September
1991 produced about 180 days of very valuable data which will continue
to occupy us for some considerable time yet. Validation has continued
to be important during this reporting period, but we are now spending
more time on scientific studies of the data. The data from version 10
of the processing suite is complete, and is being placed in the public
archives at the RAL Geophysical Data Facility and at the Goddard Space
Flight Center DAAC. Work will continue at a lower level on data
validation, and future improvements will be made available to data
users from time to time. We expect to deliver a version 11 processing
suite to GSFC at about the end of 1994.

<P> Validation of ISAMS temperatures has been principally by
comparisons with two other UARS instruments (CLAES and MLS), with
operational analyses by the Uk Met Office and the National
Meteorological service of the USA, and with radiosondes and rockets.
The results are found to be good to 1%, with ISAMS temperatures
possibly slightly too warm in lower stratosphere, a consequence of the
residual aerosol cloud from Mt. Pinatubo.  There is however a broader
spread among all of the techniques than between any one of them and
ISAMS.

<P> On the constituent front, particular progress has been made in
achieving the first global and seasonal mapping of dinitrogen
pentoxide and carbon monoxide.  N2O5 is a key constituent in the
chemical cycle which removes ozone; comparisons with local
measurements by the ATMOS spectrometer and with balloon data show good
agreement.  Interestingly, preliminary comparisons with models show
better agreement with models which exclude heterogeneous chemistry
than with, the opposite to that expected.  Model and data also deviate
at night when N2O5 levels are low, but agree well during the day.  The
ISAMS CO daytime retrievals extend up to the mesosphere, to above 100
km under some conditions, whereas at night the signal is weaker and is
detected only to 50 km or so. This is a consequence of non-LTE
radiative transfer behaviour and models to account for this are now
incorporated into the retrieval process.

<P> The angular spacecraft stability required for this work (1 arc
sec) is equivalent to locking on to a human hair at the other side of
a large lecture theatre.  The actual performance is about 4 times
poorer, and worse during the thermal 'snap' which occurs when the
satellite enters the Earth's shadow; this is equivalent to several
degrees Kelvin in its effect on the retrieved temperature profile. New
software in which data from the spacecraft's gyros are used to apply a
correction has greatly improved this situation, and brings the
attitude information more nearly into line with the radiance behaviour
in terms of amplitude and phase.

<P> Work has continued on the range of topics as reported last year, A
study of atmospheric tides has been published showing reasonable
agreement with theoretical tidal models. Work continues on the
transport of long-lived tracers by the middle atmosphere circulation,
using ISAMS data in trajectory and contour advection models, from
which we are learning a great deal about the general circulation of
the middle atmosphere. The details of the microphysics of aerosols,
both volcanic and polar stratospheric clouds, are being elucidated,
for example the relationship between the spectral response and
composition of volcanic aerosol from Mt Pinatubo.  A method has been
developed to derive the aerosol surface area from the measurements,
which is important in understanding heterogeneous chemistry in the
stratosphere, and its effect on ozone concentrations.

<P> Other continuing studies include the detection of and distribution
of gravity waves, to identify regions of high wave activity, and their
possible connection with lower atmospheric forcing; the formation and
dissipation of polar stratospheric clouds; the behaviour of nitrogen
dioxide in the winter polar regions; the polar night enhancement of
mesospheric and stratospheric carbon monoxide, due to descent of air
from the upper mesosphere into the polar vortex; and thermospheric
emission from nitric oxide and its enhancement at times of solar
flares; the behaviour of nitric acid which shows interesting
behaviour, still not fully understood, both in the polar vortex and in
intrusions of low latitude air into the polar region.

<P> New projects in this year include a simulation of the middle
atmosphere using the Meteorological Office Stratosphere-Mesosphere
Model initialised with ISAMS data, which helps to understand the
physics occurring in the features observed by ISAMS, and a study of
the departure from local thermodynamic equilibrium of the water vapour
vibrational energy levels in the upper stratosphere and mesosphere.

<P> ISAMS data has been made good use of by other investigators in the
UARS community, and its use world-wide is increasing now that the data
is in the public domain. ISAMS data is being used to produce a
climatology of the middle atmosphere, to be published by COSPAR.

<P> Water vapour measurements made from our occultation radiometer
experiment on the EURECA platform are being used to improve our
understanding of sources, sinks, and transport of water in the upper
atmosphere. As with ISAMS, the data is sensitive to spacecraft jitter,
as well as to atmospheric refraction (which shifts the solar beam by
up to 10 km in the stratosphere) and electrical interference.  All of
these effects have to be taken out, and this has been done to produce
zonal monthly means of temperature and water vapour. The error
analysis and comparisons with correlative data are still to be
completed before attempting to interpret variations between months.

<P> We are contributing to the Second European Stratospheric Arctic
and Mid-latitude Experiment (SESAME) to study the long term trends of
mid-latitude ozone and related species including hydrogen chloride and
fluoride.  Measurements will be taken throughout the coming winter at
Rutherford Appleton Laboratory, and analysed by a non-linear least
squares fit to lines in spectral microwindows using software for
atmospheric transmission calculations developed over the last ten
years.

<P> Development of the High Resolution Infrared Dynamics Limb Sounder
(HIRDLS) sensor for the Earth Observing System has proceeded at a high
level. Highlights this year have included studies of how to optimise
the spatial resolution by choice of a sophisticated scan pattern.  A
design has been produced for the HIRDLS Test &amp; Calibration
Facility alluded to above; features include exceptional cleanliness
and low vibration.  Designs have also been completed for the
calibration blackbodies, designed to have emissivities at least as
good as the 99.96% achieved for ISAMS.  Work with the University of
Toronto on designing the Measurements of Pollution in the Troposphere
(MOPITT) instrument have included detailed definition of an
aircraft-borne prototype.  Studies with the Jet Propulsion Laboratory
of the spectral requirements and radiometric performance of the
Tropospheric Emission Spectrometer (TES) have also continued.

<a name="plan"><P><h3>Space Experiments - Planetary Atmospheres</h3></a>

<P>The group is looking forward to the encounter of the Galileo
spacecraft with Jupiter in 1995.  Development of retrieval software,
including new laboratory measurements of Jovian gases at high
pressures and low temperatures, is underway. The NIMS experiment
produced very exciting data at Venus, Ida and Gaspra, and recently
observed the impact of the comet Shoemaker-Levy 9 with Jupiter.  Due
to the high-gain antenna problem most of the comet impact data is
still on the spacecraft's tape recorder, but that received so far
shows large changes to the near infrared spectrum of Jupiter in the
region of the impact.  There are obvious brightenings in the 2 to 4.5
micron region, and distinct features at 2.2, 3.3, and 3.5 microns.
Such analysis as has been possible so far suggests a fireball
temperature of at least 2400 K and a diameter of 30 km.  The spectral
features suggest that the fireball is not very deep in the atmosphere.

<P> Much progress has been made with hardware for the Composite
Infrared Spectrometer for the Cassini mission to Saturn, which
launches in 1997.  The Oxford contribution to this US-French-British
experiment is a new design of cooler and the associated cryogenic
system.  Particular difficulties which have been solved include a
clamping arrangement to survive the rigours of the planned shuttle
launch, without introducing heat leaks which incapacitate the cooler
and without loss of optical alignment.  tests have recently shown that
the latest design survives even at the very high vibration levels
required for qualification.  Electrical connections to the detectors
required the development of a ribbon cable consisting of 0.6 um of
copper on 75 um of Kaplon with a 0.2 um nickel bonding layer.  This
also has recently been successfully demonstrated after a difficult
development.

<P> A bench prototype of a spectrometer suitable for use on Mars is
being developed, based on linear variable etalons and a cooled NICMOS
FPA detector.  The device will be tested in a vacuum tank for
sensitivity, spectral and spatial response, followed by field
measurements.

<a name="gpfd"><b><p><h3>Geophysical and Planetary Fluid Dynamics</h3></a>

<P>Our laboratory research programme has continued to focus upon transition
phenomena to disordered flow in fully developed baroclinic and barotropic waves
and instabilities, which bears strongly upon attempts to understand and
quantify atmospheric predictability.

<P> Experimental investigations of transitions to 'baroclinic chaos'
in a thermally- driven rotating annulus have been extended to cover a
greater range of parameter space, and to look more closely at
sequences of transitions involving the occurrence of mixed-mode
instabilities which are modulated in space and time.  Such modulated
flows often exhibit variations on extremely long timescales, in ways
which may be analogous to forms of ultra-low frequency variability
found in very long integrations of atmospheric climate models.  The
onset of these types of flow appears to be associated with certain
types of 'bicritical point', where bifurcations relating to two
distinct spatial modes occur at the same point in parameter space, and
the resulting flow is a form of mode competition.  These flows have
also been studied using new methods of data analysis and signal
processing which make use of multivariate measurements in space and
time.

<P> Two new experiments are now under construction.  A new rotating
annulus designed to exhibit both geostrophic baroclinic instability
and rotationally-modified Kelvin-Helmholtz shear instabilities in a
rotating fluid with two-layer stratification in the vertical is
nearing completion.  This apparatus will be used to study transition
phenomena under conditions for which the classical quasi-geostrophic
two-layer theory is most appropriate.  Measurements will be made using
a novel optical method involving polarimetric measurements of the
depth of the fluid layers, one of which consists of an optically
active liquid.  The other experiment comprises a cylindrical tank with
a split lid and base which can be differentially-rotated relative to
the rest of the apparatus.  Such a system generates a detached shear
layer, which may exhibit a form of fully- developed barotropic
instability.  When completed, the observed flows will be studied using
optical particle-tracking methods and laser-Doppler anemometry to
measure fluid velocities.

<P> A new version of our 3-D Navier-Stokes numerical model of the
thermally-driven rotating annulus has been developed, in which the
advection scheme (at present just for heat transfer) has been replaced
by a semi-Lagrangian scheme of the type under investigation by the
Meteorological Office for their new generation of weather and climate
models.  Trial simulations have been carried out which, on comparison
with other model simulations and laboratory measurements, have
highlighted certain advantages and disadvantages of the
semi-Lagrangian approach.  In particular, it has become clear that a
high degree of accuracy in the spatial interpolation of tendencies is
important to achieve quantitatively accurate simulations.

<P> Good progress has been achieved in the development of new models
and a meteorological data assimilation scheme for the Martian
atmosphere.  A new and comprehensive general circulation model of the
Martian atmosphere was completed during the year, as part of a new
collaboration with the Laboratoire de Meteorologie Dynamique (LMD) in
Paris.  The new model comprises a dynamical solver which uses the
semi-spectral method (as used in our previous simple model studies in
collaboration with Reading University) and a new set of physical
parametrizations of most of the significant physical processes in the
Martian atmosphere, many of which were developed by Dr F. Hourdin of
LMD and adapted from schemes used in numerical weather prediction
models for the Earth at LMD and the European Centre for Medium Range
Weather Forecasts.  The development of the model was largely completed
during a visit of Dr Hourdin to Oxford in late 1993.  To date, a
number of multi-annual climate simulations have been carried out at
moderate-high spatial resolution, and analyses are under way.
Preliminary results indicate that baroclinic weather disturbances in
northern hemisphere winter are potentially extremely regular and
periodic, but this high degree of order is significantly affected by
the diurnal cycle of heating and cooling, rendering the flow somewhat
chaotic (as observed by the Viking Lander spacecraft).

<P> The data assimilation scheme, based on the Analysis Correction
routine as used operationally by the Meteorological Office for
initialisation of their numerical weather prediction models, has been
successfully implemented on a DEC Alpha workstation, and a number of
idealised tests have been carried out using artificial data, analogous
to that obtained from orbiter or lander spacecraft, obtained from
other model simulations.  Early results have been very encouraging, at
least as far as what might have been achievable from the Pressure
Modulator Infrared Radiometer on Mars Observer, suggesting that
appropriate instruments on board a similar orbiting spacecraft should
be well suited to a study of the circulation of Mars on synoptic and
longer timescales.  Further studies using this scheme are planned,
including further data impact investigations relevant to planned
future missions to Mars and an attempt to assimilate data from past
Missions such as Mariner 9 and Viking.

<a name="atmos"><P><h3>Middle Atmosphere Dynamics</h3></a>

<P>The main focus of the middle atmosphere modelling group continues to be the
interpretation of data from the ISAMS instrument, using a range of numerical
models of the dynamics, radiation and chemical transport of the stratosphere
and mesosphere.

<P> We have continued our detailed diagnostic study of the
temperature, winds and chemical tracers derived from ISAMS data for
the 1991-92 northern winter stratosphere and mesosphere.  We have
studied, among other things, the processes controlling the behaviour
of the stratopause (the warm region at the interface between the
stratosphere and the mesosphere).  Several modelling studies of the
stratosphere during this period are in progress, as described below.

<P> A comprehensive troposphere-stratosphere-mesosphere model
developed by the Universities' Global Atmosphere Modelling Programme
(of which we are a part) has been used for a number of simulations of
the observed data.  A major current uncertainty with such models is
the parameterisation of small-scale internal gravity waves: a variety
of parameterisation schemes are in use by various groups, and we have
tested several of these in our simulations, to assess their strengths
and weaknesses.  We have also tested some of these parameterisation
schemes in simpler, `mechanistic', models.

<P> Another model, which concentrates on the stratosphere and
mesosphere only, and which was developed in conjunction with the
Meteorological Office, has also been used for simulations of the ISAMS
data and for diagnosis of quantities like the vertical velocity field,
which cannot be estimated accurately from the satellite data.

<P> A novel scheme has been developed to reconstruct the details of
fine structure in stratospheric tracer distributions by calculating
thousands of fluid-parcel trajectories starting from observed,
coarse-grain tracer fields and integrating forwards for several days.
An alternative approach is to use the `contour advection' technique in
a similar way.  Limited comparisons of the resulting high-resolution
fields with along-track measurements suggests that the modelled fields
do display many of the filamentary structures that are present in the
stratosphere but are difficult to observe directly with current space
instruments.  The contour advection results show interesting
differences between different levels in the lower stratosphere,
depending on whether the transport is driven mainly by the upper
troposphere or by planetary-wave events in the stratosphere.

<P> On a slightly different theme, as a contribution to the Airborne
Southern Hemisphere Ozone Expedition, we have performed comparisons
between aircraft measurements in the lower stratosphere of the
southern hemisphere and model simulations and forecasts for the
region.

<a name="nonlinear"><P><h3>Nonlinear Systems</h3></a>

<P>Current areas of research include electro-hydrodynamic instabilities in
liquid crystals, convection in molten Gallium, the transition to turbulence in
a pipe, vibrating systems of pendulums, a magneto-elastic beam and an impacting
oscillator. The approach used consists of a combination of carefully controlled
experiment allied with modern mathematical ideas from dynamical systems theory.
This powerful combination has aided us in the past to uncover many novel
phenomena in the classical Taylor-Couette problem of flow between concentric
cylinders and it is now being used to good effect with the topics listed above.
In particular, new types of oscillatory motion have been found in the
convection work and organised chaos of Silnikov type has been observed for the
first time in a nematic liquid crystal.

<P> A well-accepted feature of non-linear problems is multiplicity of
states ie more than one stable state can exist at a particular value
of the control parameters. We have extended this concept by
investigating the spin up of a fluid in a toroidal container where the
initial and final states are well-defined ie rest and solid body
rotation. When the rotation rate of the final state is changed, the
path between the two states is initially uniquely defined for slow
accelerations but becomes multi-valued as the rate is increased. Thus
the process can pass through many intermediate stages which is
consistent with the idea of multiplicity of states in non-linear
systems.

<P> A novel way to add non linearity into a system is to introduce a
discontinuity into it. The particular example we have studied is a
vibrating beam whose amplitude of oscillation is small enough so that
the response diagram can be closely approximated by a forced, damped
linear oscillator. Now we place a rigid stop in the path of the beam
such that there is an impact and this can give rise to a rich variety
of dynamical motion including chaos. The system can be modelled using
a linear oscillator with the additional constraint of a simple
coefficient of restitution law applied at some fixed displacement.
Thus far, agreement between theory and experiment is satisfactory but
many of the detailed features are not yet resolved.

<P> The connection between theory and experiment in all of our work is
achieved through modern signal analysis techniques which we have
developed in collaboration with colleagues at DRA, Malvern. One
defining feature of chaotic motion is that it displays sensitivity to
initial conditions so that nearby paths diverge as a system evolves in
time. A useful experimental measure of this is to determine the
averaged Lyapunov exponent which provides an indication of the growth
or otherwise of nearby initial conditions. Various methods have been
devised over the years to determine the largest Lyapunov exponent but
now we have developed a robust method to determine the spectrum of
exponents which has been successfully tested on experimental data.


<a name="ocean"><P><h3>Physical Oceanography</h3></a>

<P>Work has continued on simulating and predicting the ENSO (El
Ni&ntilde;o/Southern Oscillation) phenomenon, the dominant mode of interannual
variability in the tropics.  Several kinds of prediction schemes have been
developed and significant predictions at lead times of 6-12 months have been
achieved, although there are still a variety of open questions to explore, such
as the selection of best predictors, the dependence of predictability on
initial conditions and the spatial distribution of the skill of different
models.  Dynamical predictions are carried out using various ocean models
coupled to an empirical atmosphere, deduced by advanced statistical techniques,
with the atmospheric response assumed to be in equilibrium with the ocean.

<P> Two ocean modules are being tested.  The first is a two and a half
layer model which simulates the upper ocean.  The initial state of the
ocean is obtained by spinning up the model with observed winds.  While
this is a reasonable procedure in some ways it also has limitations,
as errors in the wind field are translated into errors in the ocean
state and a degraded forecast results.  The ocean state can be
improved by assimilation of ocean data.  This is not done in the two
and a half layer model but is done in the second ocean module, which
is a highly resolved level model with 27 levels in the vertical and
1/3 degree resolution meridionally.  Ocean analyses are prepared at
NMC using both wind information and ocean subsurface and surface
thermal data.  Hindcasts are being tested using the multi-level model
coupled to a statistical atmosphere.

<P> The forecast skill of the 2.5 layer model has been analysed.  It
shows large decadal variability over the last three decades.  In
particular, the 70's were a period of apparently strong seasonality in
predictive skill, while the 80's showed almost no seasonality.
Forecasts can only be made over the last 30 years as there are
insufficient wind data to initialise an ocean model prior to this
time, but the seasonality of persistence forecasts can be analysed for
90 years, confirming the strong changes between the 70's and 80's.

<P> Because wind information is so important for ocean model
initialisation, it is desirable to intercompare different wind
products, such as the surface stress fields from operational weather
centres..  This shows that differences of 0.005 N/m2 are common.  This
may appear to be small but in fact can lead to SST differences of
~1deg C, which is not small.  In fact it can be comparable to the size
of the interannual signal.  Present coupled atmosphere-ocean models do
not explicitly carry a wave module.  However, there is evidence that
wave age may play a nontrivial role in determining the momentum
transfer from the atmosphere to the ocean.  Results at ECMWF, obtained
by comparing an atmosphere with an interactive wave module with one
without such a module, show that differences in the stress fields can
be appreciable.  When these stresses are used to force an ocean model
SST differences of ~1C can result in the west Pacific, a sensitive
area for coupled atmosphere ocean models.  These preliminary results,
in conjunction with KNMI, need to be confirmed in a model containing
all three modules interactively.

<P> Satellite altimetry is one of the few observing techniques capable
of providing global, time-continuous measurements of the dynamical
state of the ocean. For this reason, there has been considerable
interest in trying to use these measurements to constrain ocean models
through data assimilation. As the altimeter provides only surface
information, the problem is particularly challenging for ocean models
having more than one vertical degree of freedom.  For such models, it
is the subsurface variability as well as the directly observed surface
variability which must be deduced from altimetry. One possibility
which has been explored is to combine a time-sequence of altimeter
data with an ocean model using a 4-D variational assimilation
technique.  Assimilation experiments using simulated observations and
a multi-layer model of the tropical Pacific Ocean indicate that such a
procedure is particularly effective for constraining the subsurface
fields within the equatorial region; fast equatorially trapped waves
provide the mechanism for propagating the information to depth and the
4-D variational technique exploits their properties optimally. At
higher latitudes, where baroclinic Rossby wave propagation is much
slower, the assimilation has far less of an impact in the subsurface
layers. However, the reconstruction of the subsurface fields could be
improved considerably at higher latitudes by supplementing the
altimeter data with a relatively few number of density measurements
(such as would be available in reality from the regular network of
XBTs) and an additional (prior) constraint requiring spatial
smoothness in the solution.

<P> Climate variability on decadal and interdecadal time scales is
being studied using both an ocean-ice model and a coupled
ocean-ice-atmosphere model.  The ocean model simulates the global
ocean circulation including the deep thermohaline overturning. The ice
model incorporates both dynamics and thermodynamics and feeds back
interactively with the ocean. Experiments using the ocean-ice model
forced with random heat, wind and freshwater fluxes show considerable
interdecadal variability, including long-lived salt anomalies
advecting around the Antarctic circumpolar current. To simulate more
realistically the upper boundary condition for the ocean model we must
couple with an atmosphere model. In order that many numerical
experiments can be performed a relatively simple atmosphere model must
be used. Thus a simple reduced physics atmospheric GCM has been
designed and is being coupled to the ocean and ice models. It is hoped
that this model will capture the essential mechanisms involved in
atmospheric response to sea surface temperature. The coupled model
will be used to address the question of how atmospheric feedbacks
affect oceanic variability, and the relative importance of the wind,
heat flux and freshwater flux feedbacks.
