   <title>Beagle 2 wind sensor</title>
</head>
<body>

<h1> <u>Beagle 2 wind sensor</u> (B2WS)</h1>
<p>
<p>A hot-film anemometer has been developed for the <a 
href="http://www.beagle2.com">Beagle 2 Mars lander</a>. The sensor returns wind speed (up to 30 m/s) and horizontal component of wind 
direction. The wind sensor is simpler and lighter than previous wind 
sensors, with a total mass of only 15 g including electronics, and a 
total power consumption of only 250 mW.

<p>Three hot platinum films are equally spaced around the circumference of 
a vertical cylinder. A known current is dissipated in each film, heating
the film to 50 - 100 Â°C above the ambient gas temperature. The film
temperature is obtained by measuring its resistance. An effective heat
transfer coefficient is then calculated for each film. These coefficients
can in turn be related to the overall wind vector at the sensor. 

<p> The wind sensor's position at the end of Beagle 2's motorised arm
allows several new possibilities for wind measurement on Mars that were
unavailable in previous missions. The height of the wind sensor can be
adjusted to any height between ~20 cm and ~110 cm above the lander body,
or can be moved laterally at a given height to study the effects of lander
interference.

<p> The wind sensor was calibrated in a new wind tunnel facility, in which
Martian surface wind conditions are simulated. Wind speeds of 0 - 60 m/s
can be created in a CO2 atmosphere at pressures of 5 - 10 mbar. A cooling system which would allow wind tunnel operation at Martian temperatures (160 - 300 K) may be installed for future calibrations.
