But dost impoverish the fruitful earth,<br>

To make thy garners rise up to the heavens.<br>

To whom givest thou? Who feedeth at thy board?<br>

No almes, but unreasonable gain,<br>

<strong>EMLS MAKES ITS MOVE; NEW ISSUE OUT NOW</strong><br>

EMLS (Early Modern Literary Studies) is an old favourite. It has been based

at the University of Alberta's Department of English since the September

1997 issue (3.2). All of which makes very little difference to

web-searchers since its permanent address (PURL) has stayed the same:

<a href=http://purl.oclc.org/emls/emlshome.html> http://purl.oclc.org/emls/emlshome.html</a>.  However, the contact addresses have changed, with various things now based at Alberta. So check out the website to make sure you get details right.  Oh, and issue 3.2 is ready for access: Articles by Dennis Kay, Chris Fitter, Victoria Burke and Elizabeth Clarke of the Perdita Project, and various reviews.

<p>

<strong>TLS ARCHIVE ON-LINE</strong><br>

This service is only available to those who pay up for a subscription to

the paper TLS, but it is pretty good. There's a searchable archive of

issues since October 1994, and they are available from six months after

publication. The URL is <a href=http://www.the-tls.co.uk>http://www.the-tls.co.uk</a>.

<p>

<strong>GASCOIGNE ON-LINE</strong>

George Gascoigne's <cite>The Steele Glas & the complaynte of Philomene</cite>(1576) is

now available online at <a href=http://darkwing.uoregon.edu/~rbear/steel/steel.html> http://darkwing.uoregon.edu/~rbear/steel/steel.html</a>.  This is one of the many electronic texts under the aegis of web-hero Richard Bear, who has for some time been on-line Spenser king. Catch him at <a href=http://darkwing.uoregon.edu/~rbear/ren.htm> http://darkwing.uoregon.edu/~rbear/ren.htm</a>.

<p>

<strong>LEAR/CORDELIA WEBSITE</strong><br>

The question 'is Lear's fool actually Cordelia?' may seem to some to lend

itself to a one-word answer. However, there is a website dedicated to the

proposition at <a href=http://www.ar.com.au/~rgm/student.html> http://www.ar.com.au/~rgm/student.html</a>.

<p>

<strong>PARISH BOUNDARIES</strong><br>

A useful new research project based at Exeter, UK, which will reconstruct

and make available in electronic map form the boundaries of all the

pre-1850 parishes, townships and other local administrative districts of England and

Wales. It will be published as a CD-ROM. If you can't wait to find out

more, the man with the plan is Roger Kain, <a href=mailto:r.j.p.kain@exeter.ac.uk> r.j.p.kain@exeter.ac.uk</a>.

<strong>EARLY MODERN CULTURAL GEOGRAPHY AT CUNY</strong><br>

The colloquium series of the CUNY Renaissance Studies Program, Renaissance

and Early Modern Cultural Geography: The Places of Identity, 1500-1700, can

be viewed under '1997-98 Colloquium Series' on the CUNY website:

<a href=http://web.gc.cuny.edu/dept/renai/> http://web.gc.cuny.edu/dept/renai/</a>.  

Papers for these colloquia will be made available on the website as they

are received. At the moment, Malcolm Smuts's paper, 'Rituals of Power and

National Identities in Seventeenth-Century Britain', appears on the

website.

<p>

<strong>CONFRATERNITIES</strong><br>

The Society for Confraternity Studies has set up an electronic discussion

list. Persons interested in joining the list should send the usual command

<cite>subscribe confrat Your Name</cite> to: <a href=mailto:listserv@unc.edu>listserv@unc.edu</a>.  The Confraternities

journal published by the SCS has its own web site (including archives) at:

<a href=http://citd.scar.utoronto.ca/CRRS/Confraternitas/index.htm> http://citd.scar.utoronto.ca/CRRS/Confraternitas/index.htm</a>.  The SCS gathers scholars working on medieval and Renaissance confraternities, lay religious associations, and popular devotion or spirituality.

<p>

<strong>CLASSICS SEARCHING VIA KENTUCKY</strong><br>

There is a very flexible and impressive web-searching resource based at the

U of K: <a href=http://www.uky.edu/ArtsSciences/Classics/lexindex.html> http://www.uky.edu/ArtsSciences/Classics/lexindex.html</a>.  It searches just about every on-line classics-related resource, via bibliographies, dictionaries, encyclopaedias, rhetorical devices, etc. etc. etc. Quite an achievement.

<strong>REED WEB SITES UPDATED</strong><br>

The associated group of Web sites for the Records of Early English Drama

project at Victoria College, University of Toronto, has just undergone its

annual upgrade and revision. They now have even more links to early music

and archival sites plus (for the first time) a full listing of the REED

collections in progress with the names and e-mail addresses (where

available) of their editors. The publication list has been up-dated to

include their latest collection, <cite>Bristol</cite>, edited by Mark C Pilkinton, now

available from the University of Toronto Press.

1500-1800', 9-10 July 1998, Newnham College, Cambridge, UK. This

multi-disciplinary conference will explore English-language didactic

literature in the early modern Atlantic world. Building on, but shifting

the focus away from, conduct literature scholarship, the conference will range

widely over the genre, encompassing all types of didactic and instructional

literature from vade mecums of bee-keeping to grammars, from 'compleat'

cookery courses to universal manuals on arithmetic. How do these texts

engender and/or reflect the practices in society? And how are these

societies, and the individuals who consumed such texts, represented? Proposal deadline now past, but further information can be had from Natasha

Glaisyer, Darwin College, Cambridge, CB3 9EU (<a href=mailto:nafg2@cus.cam.ac.uk>nafg2@cus.cam.ac.uk</a>) or Sara
