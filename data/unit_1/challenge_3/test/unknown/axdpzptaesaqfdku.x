A page presenting Psalm 109 from the Ormesby Psalter, perhaps the single  most memorable MS of East Anglian illumination (see also Images 353 and 384). The psalter was worked on at various times by several artists, (probably in Norwich) from before 1300 until the 1320s - when it was presented to Norwich Cathedral Priory by Robert of Ormesby, himself a monk at Norwich - but one great artist was responsible for the most daring and forceful illustrative style, with its borders full of human, animal and hybrid and fantastic motifs.

The psalm text includes the words: '[to save him] from those that condemn his soul, O God of pity without peer, thou who hast deigned to undergo condemnation that thou mightest pluck us out from the condemnation of the law, have mercy upon us ---'. Within the initial D ('Dixit Dominus') sit God the Father and God the Son, enthroned, their hands raised in prayer and almost identical ('for he who hath seen me hath seen the Father also') canopied by a Gothic sculpture, battlemented, turreted and pinnacled, and with a half-open door to the right. On either side are six-winged seraphim standing on golden wheels (Ezekiel 1). The five figures in chainmail struggling underfoot refer to Psalm 109:1 ('I make thine enemies my footstool')

At the right hand corners of the initial are two finely-observed greenfinches. At the left hand top and bottom corners sit two small birds, the upper one in a tendrilled roundel that is being bitten into by a flying dragon-like creature. Left of the 'D' stands a figure whose loose drapery does not conceal his naked buttocks. He twists round, hand on hip, his headscarf streaming in the wind, and blows with puffed cheeks on his trumpet. Across the top border runs a hare, an owl riding facing backwards on his back, pursued by a greyhound ridden by an ape who carries some of the equipment for hawking (there may be some symbolic significanc here to the owl as the bird of darkness). In the bottom margin fight a lion and a bear ridden by two naked men who grapple with each other in a brawl that contrasts strikingly with the scene inside the initial 'D'. To each side are hybrid beasts, with long ears, dog-like faces and bird-like bodies; the necks of both creatures are caught inside the intricate interlace patterns in the two bottom corners, and at left bottom a frowning human figure is posed as if the frame is bearing down upon him. The whole border is adorned with a riot of cornflower, pea, carnation; oak, ivy and buttercup leaves; acorns, ladybirds and other winged insects.
