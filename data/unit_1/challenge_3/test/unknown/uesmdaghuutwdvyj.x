<a name="intro"><h3>Introduction</h3></a>

<P>The Department studies physical processes in the atmospheres of the
Earth and other planets of the Solar System, mainly through the
development and exploitation of remote-sensing space instruments.  Our
research activities include the design and development of space
instruments; the development of the associated data-retrieval,
assimilation and analysis techniques; the use of computer models of
atmospheres and oceans for the interpretation of data from these and
other instruments, and for the investigation of climate change; and
experimental work on rotating, stratified fluids, to investigate the
fundamentals of atmospheric dynamics.</P>

<hr width=200>

<a name="earth"><h3>Earth Observation Instruments</h3></a>

<P>HIRDLS is a joint project with the University of Colorado, funded
by NERC and NASA, to build a limb sounding radiometer to map species
amounts, temperature and pressure in the Earth's atmosphere. The
Rutherford Appleton Laboratory manage the project in the UK, and
Oxford University leads the scientific effort and undertakes many
technical tasks. The project is well into the hardware phase now, with
the Engineering Model having been completed at the Palo Alto plant of
Lockheed Martin, using an on-board radiometric calibration target and
ground support equipment provided by us, plus an outer structure and a
power supply built by Astrium and the Rutherford Appleton Laboratory
respectively. The Proto-Flight Model calibration target has been
completed and delivered to the USA ready for integration during
2001. The gyroscope subsystem has made good progress, and will be
delivered early in 2001. The Calibration Facility at Oxford is nearing
completion, with the clean-room, vacuum chamber and pumping facilities
in place, and the test equipment for providing radiometric stimulation
being built. The facility will be used for calibrating the Engineering
Model during 2001, and the Proto-Flight Model shortly afterwards. Work
has also been done on the Level 0-1 software, and on the code for
controlling the instrument in flight. Launch is scheduled for mid
2003.</P>

<P>We are collaborating with groups at the University of Toronto,
NCAR, and Leicester on MOPITT, a project to measure the distributions
of CO and CH<SUB>4</SUB> in the troposphere by passive remote
sensing. The instrument, which uses gas correlation techniques
developed at Oxford and Toronto, was built in Canada and launched in
December 1999 aboard the Terra spacecraft. It continues to operate
normally. The production by Toronto and NCAR of calibrated radiances
and of retrieved fields of CO and CH<SUB>4</SUB> using the cloud- free
emission signals is proceeding.  The reflected sunlight signals are
beginning to be addressed. An aircraft version of the MOPITT
instrument has been built and is also producing data.</P>


<a name="EODA"><h3>Earth Observation Data Analysis</h3></a>

<P>The Michelson Interferometer for Passive Atmospheric Sounding
(MIPAS) is a European project, due to be launched on Envisat in
October 2001.  Like HIRDLS, it will obtain global distributions of
temperature and constituents by measuring thermal emission from the
limb, but will use high spectral resolution rather than radiometry.
As part of an international consortium, we are involved in various
aspects of the data analysis which will retrieve geophysical
quantities from the measured spectra.  We have provided the MIPAS
reference forward model for line-by-line spectral calculations, and
continue to maintain and upgrade it.  We have also provided efficient
transmittance models to be used in the operational retrieval system,
and continue to update the transmittance tables as we move towards
launch and real data.  We have provided tools for the automated
selection of the spectral microwindows from which the operational
retrievals will be performed, based on a method developed here as a
D.Phil. project.  The validation plan for Envisat includes validation
of the operational retrieval, and we are contributing to this by
providing an independent retrieval code.</P>

<P>Work has continued on the ESA study on the proposed Atmospheric
Chemistry Explorer satellite, coordinated by Rutherford Appleton
Laboratory.  Our part has been the assessment of the capabilities of
mid-IR sounding methods.  We anticipate that this will lead to our
involvement in a collaboration in a future satellite mission.</P>

<P>The European Framework 4 study on Polar Stratospheric Clouds and
Ozone Depletion has reached a successful conclusion, and we look
forward to continuing this work under Framework 5, in collaboration
with Leicester University and others.  The work includes the use of
in-situ and satellite data, laboratory measurements and chemical and
microphysical modelling.  We are carrying out an associated laboratory
project to study simulated PSC particles spectroscopically.</P>

<P>Other smaller projects include a study the microphysics of tropical
cirrus using ATSR data; measurements of urban pollution using a
Fourier transform infrared spectrometer at a congested traffic site in
the centre of Oxford; analysis of measurements of tropospheric CO made
from an aircraft version of the MOPITT instrument; and further work on
the capabilities of limb sounders to make measurements in the region
of the upper troposphere and lower stratosphere.</P>


<a name="ADCM"><h3>Atmospheric Dynamics and Climate Modelling</h3></a>

<P>Several complex models of the Earth?s atmosphere, in particular the
Met Office?s Unified Model (UM), are being used for investigating a
range of dynamical processes - especially those relevant to climate
and climate change - and interpreting observational data. </P>

<P>Modelling studies include the following.

<P>(a) The role of stratospheric resolution in controlling the
response of the atmospheric circulation to doubled CO<SUB>2</SUB> and
ozone depletion is under investigation. </P>

<P>(b) Changes in the Arctic Oscillation in atmosphere-ocean
coupled-model integrations and in reanalysis data are being used to
identify the Oscillation?s response to anthropogenic forcing and to
look for evidence of possible nonlinearities in that response. </P>

<P>(c) The impact of changing solar irradiance on the climate system
is being studied, and in particular whether climatic changes on
century timescales (e.g. the ?Little Ice Age?) could have been caused
by changes in solar irradiance.  Tropospheric temperature anomalies
show an enhanced response to the solar forcing similar to that
associated with the Little Ice Age although the geographical
distribution is not consistent with reconstructions; however the
impact of the ozone changes in the model has yet to be
determined. </P>

<P>(d) The seasonal predictability of African rainfall is being
studied, using the UM. Current rainfall simulations in central Africa
are poor, and the seasonal and the diurnal distribution of
precipitation is not reproduced well. The importance of soil moisture
anomalies for the total rainfall of the following season is therefore
being investigated.</P>

<P>(e) Studies are being carried out on the physical processes
responsible for the annual cycle in the zonal mean tropical tropopause
temperature, driven by vertical motions. </P>

<P>(f) Ensemble experiments are being performed with a
Stratosphere-Mesosphere Model, to look at the evolution of sudden
warmings during Northern Hemisphere winter, to investigate why the
model sometimes fails to simulate observed major warmings, and to
understand how this may be linked to the configuration of the
equatorial winds.</P>

<P>Work is proceeding towards the release of <a
href="http://climateprediction.com"> climate<I>prediction</I>.com</a>,
which aims to harness the power of PCs in homes and businesses to
predict the climate of the 21<SUP>st</SUP> century by the use of
O(1,000,000)-member perturbed-physics ensembles of climate
models. This has included refining the Linux version of the Unified
Model and taking the first steps towards a Windows version. </P>

<P>Work continues, in collaboration with the several other
institutions, on the practical problem of quantifying uncertainty in
multi-decade climate forecasts as well as on more theoretical problems
in sensitivity analysis of non-linear systems. Work with colleagues at
the Met Office on climate-change detection is being extended to the
problem of attribution of causes to regional changes. Studies are
being carried out to improve our understanding of the role of the
oceans in the temporal evolution of anthropogenic climate change </P>


<a name="gpfd"><h3>Geophysical and Planetary Fluid Dynamics</h3></a>

<P>Laboratory studies of dynamical processes in rotating, stratified
flows are a valuable source of insight in atmospheric and ocean
sciences, which is complementary to observations and numerical
models. We carry out a programme of laboratory investigations into the
nature of fully-developed baroclinic and barotropic instabilities,
their transport properties, regular and/or chaotic behaviour and
transitions to disordered motion. Two new projects have started, with
the aim of tackling two quite different aspects of rotating,
baroclinic flow.</P>

<P>(a) An experimental rig which has been used for several years to
study the thermal properties of quasi- periodic and chaotic baroclinic
waves under quasi-steady, axisymmetric boundary conditions has now
been adapted to allow the application of periodic perturbations to the
thermal forcing in the experiment. This will enable us to study the
interactions of quasi-periodic and chaotic baroclinic flows with an
analogue of the Earth?s seasonal cycle and other cyclic forcing
processes. </P>

<P>The behaviour of simple nonlinear oscillators can be strongly
modified by periodic forcing, resulting in phenomena such as frequency
entrainment of the natural oscillations of the unforced system,
induced period- doubling cascades or the induction or suppression of
chaotic behaviour. Such phenomena have recently been invoked in simple
models of major climate sub-systems. The present baroclinic experiment
is arguably a laboratory analogue of the annular mode of the North
Atlantic Oscillation. Preliminary experiments suggest that nonlinear
phenomena analogous to phase synchronisation and other effects may be
observable in our experiment. It is hoped that this will open up new
sources of insight into nonlinear effects which may be important for
understanding various aspects of climate behaviour.</P>



<P>(b) Another project follows up work we carried out recently in a
rotating, baroclinic system with 2-layer stratification, in which a
cyclically-varying baroclinic flow was observed to generate trains of
small-scale, high-frequency waves which appear to be a form of
inertia-gravity wave. This is of considerable importance for dynamical
theories underlying numerical weather prediction. We are now carrying
out further laboratory experiments to try to delineate more clearly
the conditions under which these waves are generated, and to analyse
the stability and generation of such sources of unbalanced
motion. Preliminary results indicate that such waves may occur in the
experiments as a consequence of localised shear instabilities rather
than via nonlinear interactions. An instability source for such
motions is also plausible in atmospheric contexts. </P >

<a name="MPA"><h3>Modelling of Planetary Atmospheres</h3></a>

<P>We study the circulation of non-terrestrial planetary atmospheres
using numerical general circulation models, both as a source of
knowledge about the planetary systems under investigation (for
scientific studies and for spacecraft mission-planning) and as a means
of testing and validating the entire methodology of atmospheric
modelling.</P>

<I><P>(a) Mars:</I> We are continuing the development and application
of general circulation models (GCMs) of the atmosphere of Mars, in
collaboration with colleagues in Paris. The model now simulates the
Martian synoptic meteorology and climate from the surface to the base
of the thermosphere. The extension of the model domain to these
altitudes has necessitated the development (in collaboration with new
partners in Granada) of efficient and accurate parametrizations of
radiative heating and cooling rates which take account of departures
from local thermodynamic equilibrium. </P>

<P>Together with a new specification of the seasonal variation of
Martian atmospheric dust, this version of the model has also been used
to compute a new climatology which is currently being incorporated
into a new edition of the <a
href="http://www.atm.ox.ac.uk/user/lewis/mcd/index.html">ESA Mars
Climate Database</a>.  Other model studies have included some of the
first complete, autonomous GCM simulations of the dust cycle on Mars
and its interaction with the surface and the atmospheric
circulation. </P>

<P>The water cycle on Mars is of considerable topical interest. We
have begun the development of parametrization schemes to simulate the
release, transport and condensation of water in the present Mars
atmosphere. These will eventually operate in a similar way to the dust
cycle described above, running in parallel with the GCM itself. </P>

<I><P>(b) Mars Data Assimilation:</I> For several years, we have been
pioneering the application of meteorological data assimilation
techniques to the atmosphere of Mars. These combine numerical
simulations of atmospheric circulation with observations in order to
obtain optimal estimates of the evolving state of the
atmosphere. During the past year, a study was completed in which
retrieved temperature observations obtained by the Thermal Emission
Spectrometer on the Mars Global Surveyor mission (supplied by
colleagues at NASA), were assimilated. The results show good
convergence and reduction of assimilation error in the zonal mean and
stationary-wave components of the flow, and enabled some information
on the travelling baroclinic transients to be recovered, despite
relatively sparse data coverage. </P>

<I><P> (c) Jupiter and Saturn:</I> A major mechanistic model study of
Jupiter?s stratospheric Quasi- Quadrennial Oscillation was completed
and published. Work has continued using this model to examine possible
scenarios for generating and maintaining super-rotating equatorial
jets on Jupiter and Saturn via the interactions of a Hadley
circulation and equatorial Kelvin waves. Preliminary results suggest
that this combination can sustain a substantial equatorial jet, as
observed. </P>

<P>The development of a fully three-dimensional simple GCM of the
Jovian upper troposphere and stratosphere, based on the Unified Model,
has continued. Some experiments were run in equatorial limited-area
mode with large-scale waves forced artificially at the lower
boundary. Results seem largely in agreement with the mechanistic model
in supporting the combined Hadley circulation/Kelvin wave mechanism
for sustaining equatorial jets. At mid-latitudes, patterns of
latitudinally-alternating zonal jets (maintained artificially)
spontaneously generate a range of baroclinic and barotropic
instabilities, which may culminate in the formation of compact, oval
eddies, suggestive of the Great Red Spot and White Ovals on
Jupiter. This model is currently under development to include a range
of more realistic physical parametrizations, including the dominant
radiative balances. </P>


<a name="TPE"><h3>Technology for Planetary Experiments</h3></a>

<P>The Netlander mission, due for launch in 2007, will place a network
of four landers on the surface of Mars, each carrying a sophisticated
meteorological station. As part of the Netlander consortium, we have
been studying the requirements for the atmospheric sensing instruments
and, in particular, developing a deployable boom to hold the
sensors. Sensors in the Netlander/ATMIS instrument will measure
pressure, temperature at a range of heights, wind speed and direction,
relative humidity and atmospheric optical depths. These sensors will
be supplied by our collaborators and integrated onto the boom at
Oxford. We are working with the Engineering Science Department to
adapt one of their wind tunnels to allow us to precisely calibrate the
wind sensors and to cross calibrate them with spare sensors from other
missions.</P>

<P>Booms used on Mars to date have been either very massive or very
simple single-segment designs. For Netlander where the overall lander
diameter is less than 0.5 m, a multi-segment boom design is needed to
reach a height of 1m above the surface, in order to avoid surface
effects. Temperature data, for example, can be seriously affected by
thermal plumes arising from the spacecraft; this is particularly
serious since measurement of the vertical temperature gradient is a
key objective. The boom design is further complicated by the need to
save mass and hence to accommodate non-atmospheric sensing instruments
which have very different requirements.  The Netlander mission is now
well under way and we expect to begin manufacture during 2001.</P>

<P>The mass and power available for remote sensing instruments on
planetary missions are decreasing as a result of a more focussed,
low-cost philosophy.  At Oxford we have in the past been involved in
developing mainly very large instruments for huge spacecraft like
Galileo, Cassini, and UARS. Recently we have been working on designs
for miniature radiometers and spectrometers. The radiometers make use
of very small infrared filters, developed by Reading University, to
eliminate the need for multiple optical paths or heavy filter
switching mechanisms. The loss of a second PMIRR instrument on Mars
Climate Orbiter was a major blow to the study of the Martian climate
and its evolution; a central priority for us is to recover the science
lost with this mission.  It is impractical to fly an instrument as
large as PMIRR on the current generation of small Mars missions and
this is a clear example of the need for the type of miniature
radiometer we have been developing. We have been working with the Jet
Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) on the detailed design of such a
radiometer and are optimistic that it will be selected during 2001 for
a launch on the 2005 Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter.  We subsequently
plan to design a version for use on ESA's Bepi-Columbo Mercury
Orbiter.</P>

<P>We have been working on a new class of miniature interferometer
which uses large detector arrays to deliver high spectral resolution
without moving parts. Combined with on-board data processing, this
will allow us to make measurements which are impossible using broad
band radiometers and were previously only practical using very large
instruments. We are continuing, again in collaboration with JPL, to
develop this approach and plan to build a prototype Mars sounding
instrument over the next two years.</P>

<P>Both ESA and NASA are planning missions to use optical and infrared
interferometry between free flying space platforms to detect and
obtain spectra from extra-solar planets. Our group is particularly
interested in acquiring and analysing spectra to study the atmospheric
properties of these planets.  The results will allow major advances in
theories of planetary formation and evolution, as well as the search
for evidence of life-related molecules like water and ozone. The
current technical thrust is the development of the necessary optical
techniques, and their assessment in terms of the performance required
to obtain useful data. We are working, in particular, on the
development of optical delay lines suitable for use in space; this
year we have concentrated on the development of suitable cryogenic
precision actuators for these systems.</P>

<a name="data"><h3>Planetary Data Analysis</h3></a>

<P>The Galileo spacecraft continues to function after over 5 years in
orbit about Jupiter and the analysis of the data has remained a core
activity. Galileo was launched in 1989 and went into orbit about
Jupiter in December, 1995, following the successful deployment of its
atmospheric entry probe. Oxford is part of the international team
which provided the Near Infrared Mapping Spectrometer (NIMS) on board
the orbiter, which measures of the infrared spectrum from 0.7 - 5.2
<FONT FACE="Symbol">&#109;m. We have played a key role in the analysis
of the NIMS data, which began to arrive in June 1996, using an
advanced radiative transfer code which is able to simulate the complex
scattering processes in Jupiter?s cloudy atmosphere. Our models,
combined with optimal estimation retrieval code also developed here,
continue to provide new estimates of cloud heights and properties
together with the abundances of gases such as water vapour and
ammonia. To assist in this analysis, we have for many years conducted
a program to measure the spectral characteristics of Jovian gases in
the laboratory. A new study is now well under way to investigate the
low temperature transmission spectrum of methane at wavelengths less
than 1<FONT FACE="Symbol">&#109;m, together with that of ammonia from
0.7 to 5 <FONT FACE="Symbol">&#109;m. A new spectroscopic facility is
currently being built in Oxford to conduct not only these experiments,
but also those planned to support a number of future missions outlined
below. </P>

<P>In addition to the analysis of Galileo NIMS data, Oxford continues
to be involved with the Composite Interferometer Spectrometer (CIRS)
for which it provided the cooler and the cold focal plane. CIRS was
launched to Saturn on the Cassini spacecraft in 1997 and Cassini will
make a flyby of Jupiter in December 2000. Oxford will be closely
involved in the analysis of these data.</P>

<P>The group continues to be interested in remote sensing of the Venus
atmosphere and is reanalysing the Pioneer Venus OIR (Orbiter Infrared
Radiometer) data from 1979. Radiative transfer models and spectral
data bases have advanced greatly since the early 1980?s. In addition,
a new data set has become available from the Russian Venera 15
spacecraft; this is complementary to the OIR data, since it has high
spectral resolution but poor spatial resolution, whereas the OIR data
has poor spectral resolution but good spatial coverage. A combined
analysis of these data should yield greatly improved estimates for the
abundance and distribution of water vapour in the Venus
mesosphere.</P>

<P>Oxford continues to be a part of an international team (with other
members at QMW and in Canada) analysing the infrared spectra of Saturn
and Titan measured by the Infrared Space Observatory
(ISO). Simulations of the infrared spectrum of Titan, the largest of
Saturn?s moons and a key target of the Cassini mission, have been
conducted to assist in the mission planning of that project. In
addition, we have assisted in the mission design of the proposed
Beagle II lander by simulating both the direct and scattering sunlight
fluxes at the surface of the planet for different latitude/longitudes
and different times of year. This work identified an error in the
initial mission design which would have led to the spacecraft being
placed too far from the equator and thus becoming too cold to
survive.</P>
