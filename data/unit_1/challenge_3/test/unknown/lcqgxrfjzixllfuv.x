<item>	<title>Bill Clark to join Rothamsted Research as Head of Broom's Barn</title>	<description>Rothamsted Research has appointed Bill Clark, ADAS plant pathologist, to succeed John Pidgeon as the new Head of Broom's Barn. John retires at the end of April 2007 and Bill will take up the position at Brooms Barn with effect from 1 June. In the interim, Mike May, Liaison Group Leader will fill the role of Acting-head. "I am really pleased that we have attracted Bill Clark to Broom's Barn to fill this key role" said Professor Ian Crute, Director of Rothamsted Research. "Bill has a proven track record of achievement in delivering science to the benefit of the UK agricultural industry and will bring a wealth of valuable experience to the Institute". Speaking about his appointment, Bill Clark said: "I greatly look forward to working with the strong team at Brooms Barn to maintain the major contribution they make to the success of the UK sugar beet industry. With changes to the industry there will be new challenges for growers, particularly new beet growers - but I also see the science team at Brooms Barn having an impact more widely on the arable agriculture scene in the UK." Bill's appointment has also received a positive response from the British Beet Research Organisation (BBRO), "Bill is just the sort of person we were looking for to continue the strong performance of Broom's Barn in delivering value to the industry from its research investment" said John Hoyles (NFU representative). "We look forward to working closely with Bill in developing our future strategic direction for the beet crop at an exciting and challenging time for our industry" said Karl Carter of British Sugar. Bill Clark has a wealth of experience with horticultural and agricultural crops having worked as a research and extension plant pathologist in ADAS at Reading, Leeds, Newcastle and Cambridge. He currently leads the cereal research effort in ADAS and is well known throughout the industry in the UK and Europe for his work on countering the threat posed by fungicide resistance and his major contributions to optimised and integrated disease management.

Previous work at Brooms Barn Research Station2 demonstrated that innovative crop management practices deploying GM herbicide tolerant beet had the potential to deliver food for farmland birds in spring or autumn. New research, published today in the Journal Proceedings of the Royal Society B3 demonstrates an extremely cheap and simple mitigation approach to avoid any adverse impacts on bird populations. This is achieved by simply leaving two crop rows in every 100 unsprayed. Research team leader Dr John Pidgeon said "The economic benefits for a hard pressed farming sector are large. This demonstrates beyond reasonable doubt that GMHT beet can be economically and environmentally beneficial. It's a win:win situation for sustainable agriculture". Team member Professor Guy Poppy demonstrated for the first time how the &#38;lsquo;bow tie risk management approach4 could be applied to agriculture and land use. The 'bow tie' risk management approach is logical and transparent. Prof Poppy said: "Stakeholders can see clearly the likely hazards, their consequences, and decide the mitigation measures required to prevent or overcome them". "But the wider issue is that such simple ways forward were not found during the unhelpfully polarised GM debate" said Dr Pidgeon. "UK and European agriculture needs economically beneficial change to be introduced with due environmental precaution. We now have the methodologies to achieve this, with transparent, rigorous scrutiny. We need to move forward pragmatically, on the basis of evidence and not remain trapped in irrational thinking that prevents progress". Contact John Pidgeon.

Forum for the Future is working with the NFU, CLA and ARF (includes Broom's Barn on behalf of BBRO) to communicate climate change to farmers, growers and land owners across the UK to promote understanding and change from within the industry. Founder Director of Forum for the Future Jonathon Porritt hosted a fringe launch event on Wednesday January 3, with NFU President Peter Kendall, CLA President David Fursdon, ELBEX chairman John Cross and BPC spokesman Mike Storey to discuss the challenges and opportunities facing farmers from climate change. Mr Porritt said: "Farming contributes seven per cent of the UK's green house gas emissions and as a result of these emissions farmers are on the front line of adapting to the impacts of climate change. "Climate change offers one of the greatest opportunities of the 21st century. Adapting to and mitigating climate change is not just an environmental issue - its an economic opportunity. "A new website www.farmingfutures.org.uk has gone live today, and will act as resource and information hub over the next year for those in the agricultural and horticultural industries to find out more about the likely impacts and opportunities of climate change on all farming sectors, across all regions." Representing the role of farmers during the panel NFU President Mr Kendall said: "The way to tackle the issues surrounding climate change is to include farmers as part of the solution - the industry is more than ready and able to rise to the challenges of reducing its environmental impact and provide renewable energy. "Far more will be achieved by incentivising farmers and growers to reduce the negative impact that farming has on climate change than by threatening them with new taxes or yet more controls." "The success of the Voluntary Initiative, for example, has improved the efficiency with which the crop protection chemicals are used. Such measures have a minimum impact on the productive potential of farming and the maximum benefit for safeguarding our environment - which will be of such vital importance in the future for meeting our needs for both energy and food." CLAs Mr Fursdon added: "While all businesses must think carefully about climate change, land managers - farmers, foresters and moorland owners - are uniquely affected. We will use this project to build on the research the CLA has already carried out to help communicate these messages. As an industry we can then use this communication project to work together to increase our knowledge and understanding of climate change." Representing the Applied Research Forum Mike Storey, Director of R&#38;D at the British Potato Council, said: "It's important we take steps now to learn exactly what the practical implications of climate change will be and how land use will be affected. We need to understand how to mitigate against detrimental effects, but we also need to identify the opportunities and make the most of them. The ARF looks forward to working with farmers to develop ideas that will improve our understanding of this significant issue." Vice chairman of Applied Research Forum and EBLEX chairman John Cross said: "The levy boards, through the Applied Research Forum, are pleased to have this opportunity to start providing levy payers with information to help them meet the opportunities and challenges climate change poses for their businesses." </description>	<link>http://www.rothamsted.bbsrc.ac.uk/broom/news.php?id=149</link></item><item>	<title> Press release: CLA join NFU in climate change partnership</title>	<description> Press release: CLA join NFU in climate change partnership In an unprecedented move, the Country Land and Business Association has joined forces with the National Farmers Union, the Applied Research Forum and Forum for the Future, in a new project to communicate climate change to farmers, growers and land owners. Forum for the Future, the UK's leading sustainable development charity invited the NFU, ARF and CLA to join them in a bid to Defra's Climate Challenge Fund in summer 2006. The NFU and ARF signed up straight away and have now been joined by the CLA who have added further expertise to the project. The partnership won £171,506 to deliver a one year project which aims to raise awareness and understanding of the impacts of climate change, and the challenges and opportunities it presents. Peter Kendall, President of the NFU said: 'Climate change is an enormous challenge for the whole of society. By working with Forum for the Future, the ARF and now the CLA, we hope to make as many farmers and land managers as possible aware of what they can do to make a difference.' David Fursdon, CLA President, said : 'The CLA has been working on climate change for some time and earlier this year we created the Climate Accounting for Land Managers tool to help farmers and land managers to manage their carbon accounts. Working together on this project will ensure we reach as many farmers and land owners as possible to help communicate this important message. We?re looking forward to the project launch on 3rd January at the Oxford Farming Conference.' Jonathon Porritt, Founder Director of the Forum for the Future said: 'We're delighted the CLA has joined this project as our aim is to reach as many people connected to the land as possible. Climate change will affect everyone from the small dairy farmer, through to large rural estates and its important we reach everyone'. - ENDS - Editor's notes Journalists wishing to attend the launch should contact Katie Zabel, project manager on 020 7324 3670 / 07825 204434 to reserve their place in advance. The launch is a fringe event taking place at the Oxford Examinations School on Wednesday 3rd January from 4.15pm, after the first day of the Oxford Farming Conference. The project is a partnership between Forum for the Future, the Country Land and Business Association, the National Farmers Union and the Applied Research Forum. The project is funded by Defra's Climate Challenge Fund, under the umbrella title of 'Tomorrow's climate, today's challenge'.
