The figure of Christ occupies the centre of the panel, with a large halo behind his head, and wearing a tunic over a long gown. The scene shows the moment when Judas, having led the men of the chief priests and Pharisees to Jesus, is about to betray him with a kiss. Judas places his left hand at Christ's shoulder, bringing his face very close to Christ's, as if to kiss him (Luke 22:47-50). A soldier behind is holding up a lantern to illuminate this nocturnal moment of betrayal.

All five soldiers are wearing helmets and armour; the two soldiers to the extreme left and right of the panel are both leaning their hands on their battle-axes. Centre right, a soldier who is in the act of drawing his sword (broken) clutches at the fabric of Christ's tunic, as if to arrest him.

To the left, the tonsured and bearded figure of St Peter appears to be replacing his sword in its scabbard, after cutting off the ear of Malchus, the high priest's servant (John 18:10-11), who lies on the ground at the base of the panel, holding a staff in his right hand and with his left arm raised in protest. (He wears a tunic with a low belt).

Betrayal panels were a standard subject in 'Passion of Christ' altarpieces (such as that at the Nottingham Castle Museum), and over a hundred extant examples are recorded.
