<H4>Notes</H4>
If you are down to give a MAD meeting:

<UL>
<LI>Please could you let me know <B>ASAP</B> if you can't make it, or if you are able to swap, so that I can make the necessary arrangements.
<LI>Please could you email me at the above address as soon as you know what title of your work will be (preferably at least two days beforehand) so that I can inform the rest of the group in the reminder emails I send out earlier in the week, and/or update the above schedule appropriately.
<LI>Please try to ensure that your talks are ready to show at least <B>5 minutes prior</B> to the beginning of MAD meetings (i.e. usually by 13:55 on a Thursday) so that we can get on with the meetings promptly. For those of you giving Powerpoint presentations, matters can be expedited by ensuring you have a <B>Samba account</B>. This will enable you to transfer your talk to the Dobson room computer relatively quickly. Alternatively, you can email me your talk (at least 10 minutes) beforehand so that I can set it up for you.
<LI>If you are not sure about any of this, then please do to get in touch.
</UL> 

<!--When I get time, I will also look into the possibility of a facility for uploading your talks to this page, linked appropriately in the above table, so that others (like me) who can't remember what you talked about can remind themselves in more detail.-->
