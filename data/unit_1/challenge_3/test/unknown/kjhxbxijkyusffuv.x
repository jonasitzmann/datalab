<h3>Abstract (draft)</h3>

We explore methods of sensitivity analysis of ocean circulation models by
comparing the "adjoint" and direct-perturbation methods. We study the
sensitivity of time-averaged inter-gyre vorticity transport to the imposed
wind-stress curl in an eddy-permitting reduced-gravity ocean model of a
double gyre. Two regimes exist; a non-chaotic regime for low wind-stress
curl and a chaotic regime for stronger wind forcing. Direct perturbation
methods are found to converge, with increasing integration time, to a
stable "climate" sensitivity in both the chaotic and non-chaotic regimes.
In contrast, adjoint methods diverge in the chaotic regime but converge in
the non-chaotic regime. The divergence of adjoint sensitivity in the
chaotic regime is directly related to the chaotic divergence of solution
trajectories through phase-space. This suggests that standard adjoint
sensitivity methods will be unhelpful for estimating climate sensitivity
in chaotic ocean circulation models. A potentially useful alternative
method using an ensemble of adjoint calculations is explored. This is
found to give useful estimates of the climate sensitivity in the case of
the time-mean vorticity transport. The ensemble-adjoint method is
particularly useful where one wishes to produce a map of sensitivities,
for example, the sensitivity of the advective vorticity transport to
wind-stress at every point in the domain. However, useful answers are not
given by the ensemble-adjoint method for the sensitivity of the variance
of the vorticity transport to wind-stress curl. This leads to the
conclusion that the most reliable method of determining the climate
sensitivity is the direct-perturbation method, while ensemble-adjoint
techniques will only be useful in a certain sub-set of
problems.
