    <hr noshade="noshade" />
    <h3>Terms for analysis of verse</h3>
    <p><a name="accentual" id="accentual"></a><b>Accentual Verse</b>: Verse in which the <a href="#metre">metre</a> 
  depends upon counting a fixed number of stresses (which are also known as 'accents') 
  in a line, but which does not take account of unstressed syllables. The majority 
  of Germanic poetry (including Old English) is of this type.</p>


<p><b><a name="accentual-syllabic" id="accentual-syllabic"></a>Accentual-Syllabic Verse</b>: The normal system of verse composition in England since the fourteen century, in which the <a href="#metre">metre</a> depends upon counting both the number of <a href="#stress">stresses</a> and the total number of syllables in any give line. An <a href="#pentameter">iambic pentameter</a> for example contains five stressed syllables and a total of ten syllables.</p>

<p><b><a name="alexandrine" id="alexandrine">Alexandrine</a></b>: a line of six iambic feet, often 
  used to mark a conclusion in a work which is in <a href="#couplet">heroic couplets</a>: 
  Alexander Pope in his <i>Essay on Criticism</i> (1709) satirised this technique 
  (which he was not above using himself): ' Then, at the last and only couplet 
  fraught | With some unmeaning thing they call a thought, | A needless Alexandrine 
  ends the song, | That like a wounded snake, drags its slow length along.' The 
  final line of that extract is of course itself an alexandrine. Spenser used 
  an alexandrine to end his modified form of <a href="#ottava">ottava rima</a>. 
  The same word is used to describe a line of twelve syllables which is the dominant 
  form of French verse. See <a href="#syllabic">syllabic verse</a>.</p>

    

<p><b><a name="allegory" id="allegory"></a>Allegory</b>: the saying of one thing and meaning another. Sometimes this 
  <a href="#trope">trope</a> works by an extended metaphor ('the ship of state 
  foundered on the rocks of inflation, only to be salvaged by the tugs of monetarist 
  policy'). More usually it is used of a story or fable that has a clear secondary 
  meaning beneath its literal sense. Orwell's <i>Animal Farm</i>, for example, 
  is assumed to have an allegorical sense.</p>

    

<p><b><a name="alliteration" id="alliteration"></a>Alliteration</b>: The repetition of the same consonants (usually the initial 
  sounds of words or of stressed syllables) at the start of several words or syllables 
  in sequence or in close proximity to each other. In Anglo-Saxon poetry and in 
  some fourteenth century texts such as <i>Piers Plowman</i> and <i>Sir Gawain 
  and the Green Knight</i> rigid patterns of alliteration were an essential part 
  of poetic form. More recently it is used for expressive or occasionally onomatopoeic 
  effect.</p>

    

<p><b><a name="anapaest" id="anapaest"></a>Anapaest</b>: A metrical <a href="#foot">foot</a> consisting of three syllables. The first two are unstressed and the last is stressed: 'di di dum'.</p>



<p><a name="anaphora" id="anaphora"></a> <b>Anaphora</b>: Repitition of the same word or words 
  at the beginning of consecutive syntactic units.  </p>
<p><a name="apostrophe" id="apostrophe"></a><b>Apostrophe</b>: In rhetoric the word is used to describe 
  a sudden address to a person or personification. In punctuation the same word 
  is used to describe the mark ' which can be used to indicate the beginning and 
  end of direct speech, a quotation, or an <a href="#elision">elision</a>. From 
  the late sixteenth century an apostrophe was used, very irregularly, to indicate 
  a possessive form of a noun: by the mid-nineteenth century it was established 
  by convention that singular possessive forms should be indicated by "'s" ('the 
  cat's pajamas') and that regular plural possessive forms should be indicated by 
"s'" ('my parents' house'). If a plural does not normally end in 's' then the 
  form "'s" is used for the plural possessive form ('the children's tea was delicious'). 
  The main exception to this rule is 'it's', which is used as the contracted form 
  of 'it is' or 'it has'. The form 'its' is reserved for the possessive use ('the 
  door has lost its paint'). </p>
<p><b><a name="assonance" id="assonance">Assonance</a></b>: The word is usually used to describe the repetition of vowel sounds in nieghbouring syllables (compare <a href="#alliteration"> Alliteration</a>. The consonants can
      differ: so 'd<b>ee</b>p s<b>ea</b>' is an example of assonance, whereas
      'The queen will sw<b>eep</b> past the d<b>eep</b> crowds' is an example
      of internal <a href="#rhyme">rhyme</a>. More technically it is used to describe the 'rhyming of
      one word with another in the accented vowel and those which follow, but
      not in the consonants, as used in the versification of Old French,
      Spanish, Celtic, and other languages' (OED). </p>

    


<p><b><a name="asyndeton" id="asyndeton">Asyndeton</a></b>: The omission of a conjunction from a list ('chips, beans, peas, vinegar, salt, pepper'). Compare <a href="#polysyndeton">polysyndeton</a>.</p>


    
<p><b><a name="blank_verse" id="blank_verse">Blank verse</a></b>: is the metre most frequently 
  used by Shakespeare. It consists of an unrhymed <a href="#pentameter">iambic 
  pentameter</a>. It was first used in Henry Howard, Earl of Surrey's, translation 
  of Books 2 and 4 of Virgil's <i>Aeneid</i>, composed some time in the 1530s 
  or 40s. It was adopted as the chief verse form in Elizabethan verse drama, and 
  was subsequently used by Milton in <i>Paradise Lost</i> and in a wide range 
  of subsequent meditative and narrative poems.</p>

    


    <p><b><a name="caesura" id="caesura">Caesura</a></b>: A pause or breathing-place about
      the middle of a metrical line, generally indicated by a pause in the
      sense. The word derives from a Latin word meaning 'cut or slice', so the
      effect can be quite violent. However in many lines of
      <a href="#blank_verse">blank verse</a> the caesura may be almost
      inaudible. A medial caesura is the norm: this occurs in the middle of a
      line. An initial caesura occurs near the start of a line; a terminal
      caesura near its end. A 'masculine caesura' occurs after a stressed
      syllable, and a 'feminine caesura' occurs after an unstressed syllable.</p>

    


    
<p><b><a name="couplet" id="couplet">Couplet</a></b>: a rhymed pair of lines, which are usually 
  of the same length. If these are <a href="#pentameter">iambic pentameters</a> 
  it is termed a <b>heroic couplet</b>. This form was made popular by Chaucer's 
  <i>Canterbury Tales</i> and became the dominant poetic form in the latter part 
  of the seventeenth century. In the work of Alexander Pope it becomes a flexible 
  medium for pointed expression. Couplets of four iambic feet (i.e. eight syllables 
  in all) are called <b>octosyllabic couplets</b>. These were favoured by John 
  Gower, Chaucer's near contemporary, and became a vehicle for a comically brisk 
  style in Samuel Butler's satirical poem <i>Hudibras</i> (1663-78). </p>

    


<p><b><a name="dactyl" id="dactyl">Dactyl</a></b>: A metrical <a href="#foot">foot</a> consisting 
  of three syllables, in which the first is stressed and the last two are unstressed.</p>


<p><b><a name="decorum" id="decorum">Decorum</a></b>: In literary parlance, the appropriateness of a work to its subject, its genre and its audience.</p>


<p><b><a name="diction" id="diction">Diction</a></b>: or lexis, or vocabulary of a passage 
  refers to nothing more or less then its words. The words of a given passage 
  might be drawn from one <a href="#register">register</a>, they might be drawn 
  from one linguistic origin (e.g. Latin, or its Romance descendants Italian and 
  French; Old English); they might be either very formal or very colloquial words.</p>



<p><b><a name="elision" id="elision">Elision</a></b>: The omission of one or more letters or syllables from a word. This is usually marked by an apostrophe: as in 'he's going to the shops'. In early printed texts the elided syllable is sometimes printed as well as the mark of elision, as in Donne's 'She 'is all States, all Princes I'.</p>

    


    
<p><b><a name="enjambement" id="enjambement">Enjambement</a></b>: The effect achieved when the 
  syntax of a line of verse transgresses the limits set by the metre at the end 
  of the verse. Metre aims for the integrity of the single verse, whereas syntax 
  will sometimes efface that integrity. Thus 'Black drizzling crags that spake 
  by the way-side/ As if a voice were in them, the sick sight/ And giddy prospect 
  of the raving stream...' <a href="endstopping.html">End-stopping</a> is the 
  alternative to enjambement.</p>

     


    
<p><b><a name="endstopping" id="endstopping">End-stopping</a></b>: The effect achieved when the 
  syntax of a line coincides with the metrical boundary at the end of a line. 
  The contrary of <a href="enjambement.html">enjambement</a>.</p>
   


    
<p><b><a name="fabliau" id="fabliau"><i>Fabliau</i></a></b> (plural <i>fabliaux</i>): A short, 
  pithy story, usually of a bawdy kind.</p>

<p><b><a name="foot" id="foot">Foot</a></b>: the basic unit for describing metre, usually 
  consisting of a certain number and combination of stressed and unstressed syllables. 
  Stressed and unstressed syllables form one or other of the recognised metrical 
  forms: an iamb is 'di d&uacute;m'; a trochee is 'd&uacute;m di', a spondee is 
  'd&uacute;m d&uacute;m' (as in 'home-made'), an <a href="anapaest.html">anapaest</a> 
  is 'di di d&uacute;m', and a <a href="dactyl.html">dactyl</a> is 'd&uacute;m di di'. 
</p>

    


    <p><b><a name="feminine" id="feminine">Feminine Rhyme</a></b>: a rhyme of two syllables
      in which the final syllable is unstressed ('mother | brother'). If an
      iambic pentameter ends in a feminine rhyme the last, unstressed, syllable
      is usually not counted as one of the ten syllables in the line ('To be or
      not to be, that is the question' - the 'ion' is unstressed and takes the
      line into an eleventh syllable). Feminine rhyme can be used for comic
      effect, as it is frequently in the works of Byron: 'I've spent my life,
      both interest and principle, | And think not what I thought, my soul
      invincible.' It can also be sometimes used to suggest a feminine
      subject-matter, as in Shakespeare's Sonnet 20, which is addressed to the
      'master mistress of my passion' and which makes extensive use of
      'feminine' rhymes.</p>

    

<p><b><a name="form" id="form"></a>Form</b>: The term is usually used in the analysis of poetry to refer to the structure of stanzas (such as <a href="#ottava">ottava rima</a>). It can also be used less technically of the general structural principles by which a work is organised, and is distinguished from its content.</p>



<p><b><a name="free" id="free">Free Verse</a></b>: verse in which the metre and line length vary, and in which there is no discernible pattern in the use of rhyme.</p>



<p><b> <a name="genre" id="genre">Genre</a></b>(from Latin <i>genus</i>, type, 
  kind): works of literature tend to conform to certain types, or kinds. Thus we will describe a work as belonging to, for example, one of the following genres: epic, pastoral, satire, elegy. All the resources of linguistic patterning, both stylistic and structural, contribute to a sense of a work's genre. Generic boundaries are often fluid; literary meaning will often be produced by transgressing the normal expectations of genre.</p>

<p><b><a name="homophone" id="homophone">Homophones</a></b>: Words which sound exactly the same 
  but which have different meanings ('maid' and 'made').</p>

<p><b><a name="hypermetrical" id="hypermetrical"></a>Hypermetrical</b>: having an extra syllable 
  over and above the expected normal length of a line of verse. See also <a href="#feminine">feminine 
  rhyme</a>.</p>


    <p><b><a name="pentameter" id="pentameter">Iambic pentameter</a></b>: an unrhymed line of
      five <a href="#foot">feet</a> in which the dominant accent usually falls
      on the second syllable of each foot (di d&uacute;m), a pattern known as an
      iamb. The form is very flexible: it is possible to have one or more feet
      in which the expected order of accent is reversed (d&uacute;m di). These
      are called <a href="#trochee">trochees</a>. </p>

    


    
<p><b><a name="irony" id="irony">Irony</a></b>: strictly a sub-set of <a href="#allegory">allegory</a>: 
  irony not only says one thing and means another, but says one thing and means 
  its opposite. The word is used often of consciously inappropriate or understated 
  utterances (so two walkers in the pouring rain greet each other with 'lovely 
  day!', 'yes, isn't it'). Irony depends upon the audience's being able to recognise 
  that a comment is deliberately at odds with its occasion, and may often discriminate 
  between two kinds of audience: one which recognises the irony, and the other 
  which fails to do so. <b>Dramatic irony</b> occurs when an audience of a play 
  know some crucial piece of information that the characters onstage do not know 
  (such as the fact that Oedipus has unwittingly killed his father).</p>

    


    
<p><b><a name="lexicalset" id="lexicalset">Lexical set</a></b>: words that are habitually used 
  within a given environment constitute a lexical set. Thus 'Monday, Tuesday, 
  Wednesday...' form a lexical set.</p>

<p><b><a name="metaphor" id="metaphor">Metaphor</a></b>: the transfer of a quality or attribute 
  from one thing or idea to another in such a way as to imply some resemblance 
  between the two things or ideas: 'his eyes <b>blazed</b>' implies that his eyes 
  become like a fire. Many metaphors have been absorbed into the structure of 
  ordinary language to such an extent that they are all but invisible, and it 
  is sometimes hard to be sure what is or is not dead metaphor: 'the fat book' 
  may imply a metaphor, as may also be the case when we talk of a note of music 
  as 'high' or 'low'. <b>Mixed metaphors</b> often occur when a speaker combines 
  two metaphors from very diverse areas in such a way as to create something which 
  is physically impossible or absurd ('the report of the select committee was 
  a bombshell which got right up my nose'). These often result from the tendency 
  of metaphors to become received idioms in which the original force of the implied 
  comparison is lost. See also <a href="#simile">Simile</a>.</p>

<p><b><a name="metonymy" id="metonymy"></a>Metonymy</b>: A figure of speech in which the name 
  of one object is replaced by another which is closely associated with it. So 
  'the turf' is a metonym for horse-racing, 'Westminster' is a metonym for the 
  Houses of Parliament, 'Downing Street' is a metonym for the Prime-Minister or 
  his office. 'Sceptre and crown came tumbling down' is a metonymic way of saying 
  'the king fell from power'. See <a href="#synecdoche">synecdoche</a>.</p>


    <p><a name="metre" id="metre"><b>Metre</b></a>: A regular patterned recurrence of
      light and heavy stresses in a line of verse. These patterns are given
      names. Almost all poems deliberately depart from the template established by a metrical pattern for specific effect. Assessing a poem's metre requires more than just spotting an <a href="#pentameter">iambic pentameter</a> or other metrical pattern: it requires you to think about the ways in which a poem departs from its underlying pattern and why. Emotion might force a reverse foot or <a href="#trochee">trochee</a>, or the normal patterns of speech might occasionally cut across an underlying rhythm. See <a href="#pentameter">Iambic Pentameter</a>.</p>

    


<p><b><a name="monorhyme" id="monorhyme">Monorhyme</a></b>: A rhymescheme in which all lines rhyme (aaaa etc.)</p>


    <p><b><a name="onomatopoeia" id="onomatopoeia">Onomatopoeia</a></b>: The use of words or
      sounds which appear to resemble the sounds which they describe. Some words
      are themselves onomatopoeic, such as 'snap, crackle, pop.'</p>

    


    
<p><b><a name="ottava" id="ottava">Ottava rima</a></b>: an eight line verse <a href="#stanza">stanza</a> 
  <a href="#rhyme">rhyming</a> abababcc. In English it is usually in <a href="#pentameter">iambic 
  pentameter</a>. It was introduced into English by Sir Thomas Wyatt in the 1530s, 
  and was widely used for long verse narratives. Sir John Harington translated 
  Ariosto's <i>Orlando furioso</i> into ottava rima in 1591; Byron used the form 
  in <i>Don Juan</i> (1819-24). Edmund Spenser produced a nine line modification 
  of the form which ends with an <a href="#alexandrine">alexandrine</a> and rhymes 
  ababbcbcc. for his <i>Faerie Queene</i> (1590-6). This is known as the Spenserian 
  stanza, and was quite widely used by Wordsworth, Byron and Keats.</p>

    


<p><b><a name="personification" id="personification">Personification</a></b>: the attribution to a 
  non-animate thing of human attributes. The thing personified is often an abstract 
  concept (e.g. 'Lust'). Personification is related to allegory, insofar as personification 
  says one thing ('Lust possessed him') and really means another. But it is opposed 
  to allegory insofar as it aims for the maximum degree of explicitness, whereas 
  allegory necessarily involves greater degrees of obliquity.</p>

<p><a name="plosive" id="plosive"><b>Plosive</b></a>: A consonantal sound in the formation of which the passage of 
  air is completely blocked, such as 'p', 'b', 't'. The blockage can be made in 
  a variety of places (between the lips, between the tongue and teeth, between 
  the tongue and palate). A 'bi-labial plosive' is made with the lips (Latin <i>labia</i>): 
  examples are 'p' and 'b'; a 'dental plosive' is made by blocking the passage 
  of air with the tongue and the teeth ('d', 't'); an 'uvular' plosive is made 
  right at the back of the throat ('q', 'g'). Phoneticists (people who study the 
  science of pronunciation) distinguish between 'voiced' and 'unvoiced' plosives. 
  This is the distinction between 'b' (in saying which you have to make a sound 
  as well as simply letting the air escape between your lips; hence it is 'voiced') 
  and 'p' (in saying which you do not have to make a sound; hence it is termed 
  'unvoiced'). Similarly 't' is an unvoiced dental plosive; 'd' is a voiced dental 
  plosive. The <a href="http://www2.arts.gla.ac.uk/IPA/fullchart.html">International 
  Phonetic Association</a> provides more information about how words are pronounced 
  and the specialised alphabet with which such sounds are transcribed.</p>
<p><b><a name="polysyndeton" id="polysyndeton">Polysyndeton</a></b>: The use of multiple conjunctions, 
  usually where they are not strictly necessary ('chips and beans and fish and 
  egg and peas and vinegar and tomato sauce'). Compare <a href="#asyndeton">asyndeton</a>.</p>



<p><b><a name="quantitative" id="quantitative">Quantitative Metre</a></b>: A metrical system based on the length or 'weight' of syllables, rather than on <a href="#stress">stress</a>. This is the norm in classical Latin and Greek, but is rare in English. Sir Philip Sidney (1554-86) made some attempts to write in quantitative metre in order to bring English poetry closer to its classical models, but he had few imitators.</p>



    
<p><b><a name="quatrain" id="quatrain">Quatrain</a></b>: a verse stanza of four lines, often 
  rhyming abab. Tennyson's <i>In Memoriam</i> rhymes abba, however.</p>

    


<p><b><a name="refrain" id="refrain">Refrain</a></b>: A repeated line, phrase or group of lines, which recurs at regular intervals through a poem or song, usually at the end of a <a href="#stanza">stanza</a>. The less technical term is 'chorus'.</p>



<p><b><a name="register" id="register">Register</a></b>: a term designating the appropriateness of a given style to a given situation. Speakers and writers in specific situations deploy, for example, a technical vocabulary (e.g. scientific, commercial, medical, legal, theological, psychological), as well as other aspects of style customarily used in that situation. Literary effect is often created by switching register.</p>



<p><b><a name="rhetoricalfigures" id="rhetoricalfigures">Rhetorical Figures</a></b>: Linguistic effect 
  can be perceptible to the mind and/or the eye. <em>Figures of thought</em> appeal 
  to the mind by twisting language in a way that is strictly improper, but licensed 
  by usage. Thus the word 'is' is used improperly in the sentence 'John is a lion', 
  but the metaphorical usage is permissible. Or when we hear the sentence 'All 
  hands on deck', we understand that the word 'hands' is being used as a <a href="#synecdoche">synecdoche</a> 
  for sailors. Figures of thought are sometime called <a href="#trope">tropes</a> 
  (from a Greek word meaning 'turn', 'twist') or <em>conceits</em> (from a Latin 
  word meaning 'concept', because the conceit appeals to the mind). <em>Figures 
  of speech</em> are perceptible to the eye and the ear. Thus rhyme is a figure 
  of speech, as is alliteration and <a href="#anaphora">anaphora</a>. Figures 
  of speech are sometimes called <em>schemes</em> (Greek 'forms').</p>



    <p><b><a name="rhyme" id="rhyme">Rhyme</a></b>: When two or more words or phrases
      contain an identical or similar vowel-sound, and the consonant-sounds that
      follow are identical or similar (red and dead). <b>Feminine rhyme</b>
      occurs when two syllables are rhymed ('mother | brother'). <b>Half-rhyme</b>
      occurs when the final consonants are the same but the preceding vowels are
      not. ('lo<b>ve</b> | ha<b>ve</b>')<b>. Eye rhyme</b> occurs when two
      syllables look the same but are pronounced differently ('kind | wind' -
      although sometimes changes in pronunciation have made what were formerly
      perfect rhymes become eye rhymes). <b>Rime riche</b> occurs when the same
      combination of sounds is used in each element of the rhyme, but where the
      two identical sounding words have different senses ('maid | made'). This
      was in the medieval period regarded as a particularly perfect form of
      rhyme. <b>Leonine rhyme</b> occurs when the syllable immediately preceding the <a href="#caesura">caesura</a> rhymes with the syllable at the end of the line. The <b>Rhyme Scheme</b>, or regularly recurring patterns of rhyme
      within a poem or stanza, is recorded by using a letter of the alphabet to
      denote each rhyme, and noting the order in which the rhymes recur
      (aabbcc... is the most simply rhyme scheme of all, that of the couplet).</p>

    


<p><a name="rhythm" id="rhythm"><b>Rhythm</b></a>: a term designating the pattern of stressed and unstressed syllables in verse or prose. Different lines of verse can have the same <a href="#metre">metre</a> but a different rhythm. Thus two lines of alliterative verse in Middle English poetry might have the same metrical pattern of four stressed syllables, but their rhythm might differ by having a greater or lesser number of unstressed syllables intervening between the stressed syllables.</p>

    


    
<p><a name="royal" id="royal"><b>Rhyme Royal</b></a>: A form of verse which consists of <a href="#stanza">stanzas</a> 
  of seven ten-syllable lines, riming a b a b b c c. It was first used by Chaucer, 
  and was also the form chosen by Shakespeare for the tragic gravity of his narrative 
  poem <i>Lucrece</i> (1594).</p>

    


    
<p><b><a name="simile" id="simile">Simile</a></b>: a comparison between two objects or ideas 
  which is introduced by 'like' or 'as'. The literal object which evokes the comparison 
  is called the <b><a name="tenor" id="tenor">tenor</a></b> and the object which describes 
  it is called the <b><a name="vehicle" id="vehicle">vehicle</a></b>. So in the simile 'the 
  car wheezed like an asthmatic donkey' the car is the tenor and the 'asthmatic 
  donkey' is the vehicle. <b>Negative similes</b> are also possible (as in Shakespeare's 
  Sonnet 'My mistress' eyes are nothing like the sun'). <b>Epic similes</b> are 
  more extended similes, which might involve multiple points of correspondence 
  between tenor and vehicle. The frequently occur in long heroic narrative poems 
  in the classical tradition, such as Milton's <i>Paradise Lost</i> (1667), as 
  when Milton describes the combat of Satan and Death:</p>

    <p>'Incenst with indignation Satan stood<br />Unterrifi'd, and like a Comet
      burn'd, <br />That fires the length of Ophiucus huge <br />In th' Artick
      Sky, and from his horrid hair <br />Shakes Pestilence and Warr. Each at the
      Head <br />Level'd his deadly aime; thir fatall hands <br />No second stroke
      intend, and such a frown <br />Each cast at th' other, as when two black
      Clouds <br />With Heav'ns Artillery fraught, come rattling on <br />Over the
      Caspian, then stand front to front <br />Hov'ring a space, till Winds the
      signal blow <br />To joyn thir dark Encounter in mid air: <br />So frownd
      the mighty Combatants, that Hell <br />Grew darker at thir frown, so matcht
      they stood...' </p>

    <p>This double simile (first Satan is compared to a comet, then to a cloud)
      reflects back on the literal action: the violent energy of the comet is
      damped down by the immobile clouds. This change of vehicle reflects back
      on the fight which is the simile's tenor: it suggests that Satan starts
      off blazing with eagerness to fight Death, and then pauses, perhaps
      nervously.</p>

    


    
<p><a name="sonnet" id="sonnet"><b>Sonnet</b></a>: In its earliest usages this can mean just 
  'a short poem, often on the subject of love.' Now it is almost always used to 
  denote a fourteen line poem in <a href="#pentameter">iambic pentameter</a>. 
  There are two main forms of Sonnet: the 'Shakespearean Sonnet' rhymes abab cdcd 
  efef gg. It was the form favoured by Shakespeare, in his <i>Sonnets</i> (1609), 
  although it is first found in the work of Henry Howard, Earl of Surrey. The 
  three quatrains can be linked together in argument in a variety of ways, but 
  often there is a 'volta' or turn in the course of the argument after the second 
  quatrain. The final <a href="#couplet">couplet</a> often provides an opportunity 
  to sum up the argument of the poem with an epigram. Edmund Spenser's <i>Amoretti</i> 
  (1595) introduced a variant form in which the quatrains are connected by rhyme: 
  abab bcbc cdcd ee. The 'Petrarchan Sonnet', which is the earliest appearance 
  of the form, falls into an octet, or eight line unit, and a sestet, or six line 
  unit. The Petrarchan sonnet form rhymes abbaabba cdecde (although the sestet 
  can follow other rhyme-schemes, such as cdcdcd). Often there is a marked shift 
  in the progression of the argument after the octet in the Petrarchan sonnet, 
  which is sometimes vestigially registered in the Shakespearean form by a change 
  of argument or mood at the start of the third quatrain. Sonnets may be free-standing 
  poems, or they may form part of an extended sequence of poems which might relate 
  in a loose narrative form the progress of a love affair (as is the case in Sidney's 
  <i>Astrophil and Stella</i>, Spenser's <i>Amoretti</i> and Petrarch's <i>Canzoniere</i>).</p>



    <p><b><a name="stanza" id="stanza">Stanza</a></b>: 'A group of lines of verse
      (usually not less than four), arranged according to a definite scheme
      which regulates the number of lines, the metre, and (in rhymed poetry) the
      sequence of rhymes; normally forming a division of a song or poem
      consisting of a series of such groups constructed according to the same
      scheme' (OED). See also <a href="#ottava">ottava rima</a>,
      <a href="#quatrain">quatrain</a>. This term is preferable to the less
      technical 'verse', since that word can also refer to a single line of a
      poem. In printed poems divisions between stanzas are frequently indicated
      by an area of blank space.</p>

    


<p><b><a name="stress" id="stress">Stress</a></b>: Emphasis given to a syllable in pitch, volume or duration (or several of these). In normal spoken English some syllables are given greater stress than others. In <a href="#metre">metrical</a> writing these natural variations in stress are formed into recurrent patterns, such as <a href="#pentameter">iambs</a>, <a href="#anapaest">anapaests</a> or <a href="#trochee">trochees</a>.</p>



<p><b><a name="strophe" id="strophe">
Strophe</a></b>: A <a href="#stanza">stanza</a> or other grouping of lines within a poem. In classical odes the term is used of the first group of lines which might be followed by an antistrophe which exactly replicates the <a href="#form">form</a> of the strophe.</p>



<p><b><a name="syllable" id="syllable">Syllable</a></b>: The smallest unit of speech that normally occurs in isolation, or a distinct sound element within a word. This can consist of a vowel alone ('O') or a combination of a vowel and one or more consonants ('no', 'not'). <b>Monosyllables</b> contain only one syllable ('dog', 'big', 'shoe'); <b>polysyllables</b> contain more than one syllable. The word 'syllable' contains three syllables.</p>



<p><b><a name="syllabic" id="syllabic">Syllabic Verse</a></b>: A metrical system which depends solely on syllable count, and which takes no account of <a href="#stress">stress</a>. This is the norm in most Romance languages (French, Italian, Spanish), but is unusual (and almost always consciously experimental) in English.</p>


<p><a name="synecdoche" id="synecdoche"><b>Synecdoche</b></a>: the rhetorical figure whereby a 
  part is substituted for a whole ('a suit entered the room'), or, less usually, 
  in which a whole is substituted for a part (as when a policeman is called 'the 
  law' or a manager is called 'the management'). See <a href="#metonymy">metonymy</a>.</p>


    
<p><a name="topos" id="topos"><b>Topos</b></a>: from a Greek word meaning 'place', a 'topos' 
  in poetry is a 'commonplace', a standard way of describing a particular subject. 
  Describing a person's physical features from head to toe (or somewhere in between) 
  is, for example, a standard topos of medieval and Renaissance poetry.</p>

<p><b></b><b><a name="trochee" id="trochee">Trochee</a></b>: a <a href="#foot">foot</a> of 
  two syllables, in which the accent falls on the first syllable (d&uacute;m di). 
  Some words which are trochaic include 'broken', 'taken', 'Shakespeare'.</p>


    
<p><b><a name="trope" id="trope">Trope</a></b>: a general term for any figure of speech which 
  alters the literal sense of a word or phrase: so <a href="#metaphor">metaphor</a>, 
  <a href="#simile">simile</a> and <a href="#allegory">allegory</a> are all tropes, 
  since they affect the meaning of words. In the rhetorical tradition tropes are 
  contrasted with <b><a name="figure" id="figure">figures</a></b>, which are rhetorical devices 
  which affect the order or placing of words (so the repetition of a particular 
  word at the start of each line is a figure).</p>

<h3>Basic Grammatical Terms</h3>
<p><b><a name="adjective" id="adjective">Adjective</a></b>: A word which qualifies or
      modifies the meaning of a <a href="#noun">noun</a>; as in a '<b>red</b>
      hat' or a '<b>quick</b> fox'. They can be used to complement the verbs
      'to be' or 'to seem' ('Sue seems <b>happy</b> today'). Adjectives are
      sometimes formed from <a href="#noun">nouns</a> or <a href="#verb">verbs</a>
      by the addition of a suffix such as '-able' (lovable), '-ful' (heedful),
      '-ic' (heroic), '-ish' (foolish), '-ive' (combative), '-ous' (famous), or
      '-y' (needy).</p>

    


    <p><b><a name="adverb" id="adverb">Adverb</a></b>: A word which qualifies or adds to
      the action of a verb: as in 'he ran <b>quickly</b>', or 'he ran <b>fast</b>'.
      Adverbs can also qualify <a href="#adjective">adjectives</a>, as in 'the
      grass is <b>intensely</b> green'. They are usually formed by adding '-ly'
      to an <a href="#adjective">adjective</a>: 'playfully', 'combatively',
      'foolishly'. They can also sometimes be formed by the addition of '-wise'
      to a noun ('the hands went round <b>clockwise</b>). </p>

    


<p><b><a name="clause" id="clause">Clause</a></b>: The word is often used but very hard to 
  define. It is a <a href="#sentence">sentence</a> or sentence-like construction 
  included within another sentence. A <b>main clause</b> might be a simple <a href="#noun">noun</a> 
  plus <a href="#verb">verb</a> ('I did it'). A <b>co-ordinate clause</b> is of 
  equal status with the main clause: 'I did it and she did it at the same time.' 
  A <b>subordinate clause</b> might be nested within a sentence using the <a href="#conjunction">conjunction</a> 
  'that': 'he said that the world was flat.' Here 'he said' is the main clause 
  and the subordinate clause is 'the world was flat'. <b>Relative clauses</b> 
  are usually introduced by a <a href="#pronoun">relative pronoun</a>: 'I read 
  the book <b>which was falling to pieces</b>'; 'She spoke to the man <b>who was 
  standing at the bar</b>.'</p>



<p><b><a name="conjunction" id="conjunction">Conjunction</a></b>: A word used to connect words or constructions. <b>Co-ordinating conjunctions</b> such as 'and', and 'but' link together elements of equal importance in a sentence ('Fish and chips' are of equal importance). <b>Subordinating conjunctions</b> such as 'because', 'if', 'although', connect a subordinate <a href="#clause">clause</a> to its superordinate clause ('We will do it <b>if</b> you insist'; 'We did it <b>because</b> he insisted).</p>


    
<p><b><a name="noun" id="noun">Noun</a></b>: A word used as the name or designation of a 
  person or thing, such as 'duck' or 'river'. <b>Abstract nouns</b> denote abstract 
  properties, such as 'invisibility', 'gentleness'. <b>Proper nouns</b> are nouns 
  that designate one thing, as, for example, personal names.</p>

    


    <p><a name="object" id="object"><b>Object</b></a>: Usually the thing to which the action of a verb is done. More technically a substantive word, phrase, or
      clause, immediately dependent on, or &#145;governed by&#146;, a verb, as
      expressing, in the case of a verb of action, the person or thing to which
      the action is directed, or on which it is exerted; that which receives the
      action of the verb. So 'the man patted the <b>dog</b>', 'the woman was
      reading <b>the book</b>'. An <b>indirect object</b> of a verb denotes
      that which is indirectly affected by an action, but wihch is not the immediate
      product of it, as &#145;Give <b>him</b> the book&#146;, &#145;Make
      <b>me</b> a coat&#146;.</p>

    


    <p><b><a name="participle" id="participle">Participle</a></b>: a word derived from a <a href="#noun">noun</a> which functions like an <a href="#adjective">adjective</a>, as in 'let <b>sleeping</b> dogs lie'. More technically 'A word that partakes of
      the nature of a verb and an adjective; a
      derivative of a verb which has the function and construction of an
      adjective (qualifying a noun), while retaining some of those of the verb'.
      Present participles usually end in '-ing' and usually describe an action
      which is going on at the same time as the verb: so in the sentence '&quot;Go
      and play on your own street,&quot; she said, <b>kicking</b> the ball',
      the saying and the kicking are simultaneous. <b>Past participles</b>
      usually end in '-ed' or '-en' ('the door was <b>kicked</b> in'; 'the door
      was <b>broken</b>'). They are used in two main ways: combined with the
      verb 'have' they form a past or 'perfect' tense (so called because it
      describes an action which has been completed or 'perfected'), as in 'I
      have <b>smashed</b> the plate'. Past participles can also be used in
      passive constructions (which describe what was done to something rather
      than what something did), as in 'the plate was <b>smashed</b>'.</p>

    


    <p><b><a name="preposition" id="preposition">Preposition</a></b>: A part of speech which
      indicates a connection, between two other parts of speech, such as 'to',
      'with', 'by' or 'from'. 'She came <b>from</b> China', 'He gave the
      chocolates <b>to</b> me'.</p>

    


    <p><a name="pronoun" id="pronoun"><b>Pronoun</b></a>: A part of speech which stands
      for a noun: 'he', 'she', 'him', 'her', 'them'. <b>Possessive pronouns</b>
      express ownership ('his', 'hers'). <b>Reflexive pronouns</b> are
      'herself', 'himself', 'myself' and are used either for emphasis (he did it
      all <b>himself</b>'), or when an action reflects back on the agent who
      performs it ('he shot <b>himself</b> in the foot'). <b>Relative pronouns</b>
      include 'who', 'which', 'that' and are usually used in the form 'he
      rebuked the reader <b> who</b> had sung in the library'. <b>Interrogative
      pronouns</b> ask questions ('<b>Who</b> stole the pie?'; '<b>Which</b>
      pie?'). <b>Indefinite pronouns</b> do not specify a particular person or
      thing: '<b>Anyone</b> who studies grammar must be mad.' '<b>Somebody</b>
      has to know about this stuff.'</p>

    


    <p><b><a name="sentence" id="sentence">Sentence</a></b>: This is a term which
      professional linguists still find impossible to define adequately. It is
      usually supposed to be 'A sequence of words which makes complete sense,
      containing <a href="#subject">subject</a>, <a href="#object">object</a> and main <a href="#verb">verb</a>, and concluded by a full-stop'.
</p>

    


    <p><b><a name="subject" id="subject">Subject</a></b>: Usually the person or thing who is performing the action of a <a href="#verb">verb</a>. More technically the grammatical subject is the part of a sentence of which an action is predicated: 'the <b>man</b>
      patted the dog'. It can be a single <a href="#noun">noun</a>, or it can
      been a complex clause: 'the <b>bald man who had just picked up the ball</b>
      gave it to the dog.'</p>

    


<p><b><a name="syntax" id="syntax">Syntax</a></b> (Greek 'together arrangement'): a term designating 
  the way in which words can be arranged and modified to construct sentences. 
  Writers characteristically use syntactic <em>sub-ordination</em> when they aim 
  for a highly formal effect, and syntactic <em>co-ordination</em> when they aim 
  for a simpler, more straight-forward effect.</p>

    

    
<p><b><a name="verb" id="verb">Verb</a></b>: Usually a word which describes an action (such 
  as 'he <b>reads</b> poems', 'she <b>excels</b> at cricket'). More technically 
  'That part of speech by which an assertion is made, or which serves to connect 
  a subject with a predicate.' This technical definition includes the most frequent 
  verb in the language: the verb 'to be' which can be used to connect a 'subject', 
  such as 'he', with a 'predicate', such as 'good at hockey'. There are verbs 
  which take an <a href="#object">object</a> ('he <b>raps</b> the desk'), which 
  are called <b>transitive verbs</b>. Other verbs do not, and are termed <b>intransitive 
  verbs</b> ('I sit, he lives'). Some verbs can be used either transitively or 
  intransitively: 'I sing' is an intransitive usage; 'Paul McCartney sings &quot;God 
  save the Queen&quot;' is a transitive usage. The <b>main verb</b> is the verb 
  on which the structure of the sentence depends, and without which the sentence 
  would not make any sense. In the following sentence the verb 'fell' is the main 
  verb: 'The boy, who had run too quickly, fell'.</p>

<p>There are many dictionaries of literary terms available. One of the most user-friendly 
  is <i>The Concise Oxford Dictionary of Literary Terms</i>, ed. Chris Baldick 
  (Oxford, 1990). More substantial (and also slightly more expensive) <i>The Penguin 
  Dictionary of Literary Terms and Literary Theory</i>, 4th edition, ed. J.A. 
  Cuddon, revised C. E. Preston (Harmondsworth, 1998). John Lennard, <i>The Poetry 
  Handbook</i> (Oxford, 1996) is a very helpful guide to ways of using this technical 
  vocabulary in practical criticism.</p>
