<H1>First and second year reports</H1>

<P>
I thought I would include a LaTeX <a href="template12.tex">template file</a> of the sort I used to write up my first and second year reports - it differs considerably from the one I used for my thesis. The thesis one includes a few simple examples, but the one given here is just the bare bones! See my <a href="latex.html">LaTeX</a> information page for more help.
