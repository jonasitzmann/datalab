      <p>This M. Phil. provides a nine-month course of literary study in the
        period  of &#8216;the long eighteenth-century&#8217;. The course consists
        of seminars  and classes, together with individual study and supervision.
        Training 
        in relevant research skills is included. Students will have access to
         the magnificent resources of the Cambridge University Library, one of
        
        the few copyright libraries in the UK, as well as to many special holdings
         in College libraries. They will be able to take courses from other selected
        
        M.Phils. and to attend lectures in the English Faculty and in related
         faculties such as History, Classics, Modern Languages, History of Art,
        
        Philosophy, and History and Philosophy of Science. </p>
      <h2><a name="course" id="course">The Course</a></h2>
      <p>Seminars run throughout the Michaelmas and Lent Terms. These will include
        courses of fortnightly seminars offered by individual faculty members
        on their areas of special interest. In addition, there will be an introduction
        to research skills, electronic resources, and critical approaches, as
        well as research seminars at which invited speakers read papers. Students
        will normally take two course-options each term; alternatively, they
        may
        opt to substitute in one or both terms an appropriate course-option from
        another M.Phil. in English ( <a href="MedRen_MPhil_Info.htm">Medieval
        and Renaissance Literature</a>, <a href="AmLit_MPhil_Info.htm">American
        Literature, </a> and <a href="Criticism_Culture_MPhil_Info.htm">Criticism
        and Culture</a>) or, by arrangement, from
        an M.Phil in certain other faculties (<a href="http://www.mml.cam.ac.uk/">Medieval
        and Modern Languages</a>, <a href="http://www.hoart.cam.ac.uk/"> History
        of Art and Architecture</a>, <a href="http://www.hps.cam.ac.uk/"> History
        and Philosophy of Science</a>).</p>
      <p>The course thus offers both a common core of period-based study and the 
        opportunity for individuals to choose from a varied and interdisciplinary 
        menu. The program fosters a strong sense of intellectual community and 
        collaborative exchange; this is particularly evident in the two-day graduate 
        conference put on in the final term of the course under the auspices of 
        the English Faculty, but organised and run by graduates for graduates. 
        The optional elements permit students to develop their own interests, 
        and to focus their whole scheme of work either more sharply or more adventurously, 
        as they please. This combination of intellectual community with individual 
        flexibility is one of the great strengths of the M.Phil. </p>

      <p>Work done in relation to the four seminar course-options taken by each
         student is assessed by three coursework essays (i.e. the student chooses
        
        not to be assessed on the work done for one of the four). These essays
         are of not more than 4,000 words each; the topics are chosen by the
        student 
        with the agreement of the Graduate Sub-Committee.The marks for these
         essays count together for 60% of the M. Phil. as a whole.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, throughout the nine months, students will be pursuing individual
         research on a topic of their choice, supported by frequent consultation
        
        with their personal supervisor. At the end of the first term, students
         will submit an annotated bibliography for their dissertation, and at
        the 
        end of the second term, a detailed dissertation prospectus. These will
         be assessed on a pass/fail basis, and will be useful preparation for
        the 
        writing of a dissertation of between 10,000 and 15,000 words, which will
         provide the main focus of the student's work between April and June.
        The 
        mark for the dissertation counts for 40% of the M. Phil. as a whole.</p>
      <p>Applicants should include a brief statement of their previous literary 
        or other relevant academic training in the period, and a research proposal 
        of not more than 350 words. Considerable weight is put on the research 
        proposal and applicants are advised to be as specific about their plans 
        as possible. Applicants interested in taking courses from other M.Phils. 
        in English or elsewhere should indicate this as part of their application.

      <p>in Cambridge are members of a College as well as of a Faculty of the 
        University, and those applying through the Board of Graduate Studies for 
        a place on the course will find themselves invited to list a number of 
        Colleges in order of preference. It is a good idea to consult the <a 
      href="http://www.cam.ac.uk/CambUniv/Finding/Addresses/college.html">prospectuses 
        of a number of Colleges</a> before you apply. </p>
      <p>Applications are first considered by the Faculty. Potential supervisors 
        are then consulted. Successful applications are then offered to the Colleges 
        of the student's choice, and may be then passed on to the second or third 
        choice. Since this can be a lengthy process it is very much in the interests 
        of applicants to apply in good time (and before the <strong>deadline for 
        applications of January 15th). </strong></p>
      <p>Applicants for funding should be aware that many funding bodies (e.g.
         the <a href="http://www.ahrb.ac.uk">Arts and Humanities Research Council </a>)
          require a firm acceptance from the University before they will consider
         
        your application. If you hope to have a decision from the University
         in  time to apply for funding, you should apply well before the <strong>January </strong><strong>15th </strong>deadline. You may find it helpful in drawing up 
        your funding application to have had some discussion with the person assigned 
      to be your supervisor.</p>

      <p>Applicants should normally have a first-class honours degree or high 
        II.i, or its overseas/international equivalent. Applicants whose first 
        degrees are in other disciplines are always considered, provided they 
        can give an account of how their interest in literary study has developed. 
        We welcome qualified UK, EU, and overseas applicants (those for whom English 
        is not a first language will be required by the Board of Graduate Studies 
        to provide evidence of linguistic proficiency). </p>
      <p>Applicants should include specific proposals for advanced study or research 
        (of around 500 words). A piece of written work, of 5,000 - 7,500 words, 
        should accompany a formal application. Applicants may submit any work 
        they like, but it is worth choosing work which is recent and which relates 
        to your proposed area of study, if this is available. Many applicants 
        submit their undergraduate dissertation or similar extended piece of work.
