<h2>Radiometric Blackbody Targets for HIRDLS Calibration</h2>

<p>End-to-end radiometric calibration was performed on the <a
href="http://www.atm.ox.ac.uk/hirdls/home.htm">HIRDLS instrument</a>
using two identical full aperture blackbody targets, Fig 1. Each
target has an entrance aperture of 256 mm diameter and a calculated
normal emissivity greater than 0.9995. The emissivity calculations
were based on measurements of the hemispherical spectral reflectance
of the paint used to coat the cavity walls (Nextel 811-21) and
computer modelling of specular reflections.</p>

<p>The targets employ a novel helium gas switch design to ensure rapid
cooling to base temperatures (<100 K) and powerful heaters for fast
warm-up and temperature control.</p>

<p>Radiometric calibration of the HIRDLS instrument involved
making radiance measurements at temperature plateaux (see Fig 2) while
the viewed target was temperature stable at the set-point to better
than 5 mk/minute over a period of 15 to 20 minutes. The four zone
heater controller, the helium gas switch and the large mass of the
cavity assembly (approximately 40 kg) provided exceptional stability
and temperature uniformity at the set-point, with temperature
gradients of less than 0.5 K routinely achievable along the 1 metre
long cavity assembly.</p>

<p>Target temperatures were monitored using stabilised and calibrated
Oxford Instruments' 27 ohm Rhodium-Iron resistance thermometers
(RIRTs). The thermometers were calibrated at the department against an
in-house secondary standard (a Tinsley 5187L) and to an absolute
accuracy of better than 10 mK.</p>

<p>The use of identical targets permitted calibration at two azimuth
positions, spaced 30 degrees apart, while jacking mechanisms, Fig 3,
moved the targets 5 degrees in elevation about arcs centred on the
instrument's scan mirror. Radiometric signals from the two large
calibration targets were chopped by the instrument to a 'zero-radiance
space view' provided by third liquid nitrogen cooled blackbody target,
Fig 4.</p>
