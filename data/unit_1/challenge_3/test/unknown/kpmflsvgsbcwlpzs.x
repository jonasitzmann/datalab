<h3><a name="1"></a>1. Introduction </h3>
<p>The first public parks in the country were established in the 19th century to help improve the living conditions for workers in the new industrialised Towns. Urban parks and other green spaces have been valued ever since as an important part of our Towns and Cities.</p>
<p>The Social Reformer, John Ruskin stated &quot;The measure of any great civilisation is in its cities and a measure of a city's greatness is to be found in the quality of its public spaces, its parks and its squares&quot;.</p>
<p>Over the past few years much research has been carried out to gauge the full benefits of our parks and a publication by CABE Space (part of the commission for Architecture and the built environment). &quot;The value of public space&quot; (2004) demonstrated how parks improve many aspects of our lives &ndash; helping to improve our health, providing places for children to play and learn, increasing the economic value of a Town and providing space for wildlife.</p>
<p>Tameside Council is committed to managing and developing its parks and green spaces for the benefit of all its residents and has stated its intention to achieve Green Flag standards of design, management and maintenance in its major parks and green spaces.</p>
<p>As part of this commitment the Council is producing a series of management plans, which will plan for the long term management of each of Tameside's major urban parks ensuring that they meet the needs of the whole community in line with the Council Policy.</p>
<p>The park was awarded its first Green Flag by the Civic Trust in 2000 and has continued to receive this award since.</p>

            <td>
            <p>Victoria Park was opened officially in 1913 on land which had been bought in 1886.</p>
            <p>The Park originally had a number of features which have been lost over the years including a children's paddling pool, a drinking fountain and a stone archway at the entrance to the bowling greens. Fortunately other features such as the bandstand, bowling green and flower gardens have been retained to the present day. The war memorial originally unveiled on July 23rd 1921 also remains as an important feature of today's park.</p>
            <p>In common with many other urban parks across Britain, Victoria Park suffered a decline in its appearance over of period of time. However, in recent years work has been undertaken to halt this pattern and improve the condition of the park. Recognition of this was the award in 2000 of the park's first Green Flag, which served not only to note what had been achieved but more importantly to form a base from which to move forward and improve this important and popular local park still further.</p>

            <p>Victoria Park has largely retained its original layout of pathways surrounded by lawns, shrubs and flowerbeds.</p>
            <p>The flowerbeds are replanted twice each year to provide spectacular displays throughout the seasons, while a longer term programme allows for other areas to be rejuvenated and planted with a wide variety of shrubs and trees as existing plants become over mature.</p>
            <p>Within this beautiful setting may be found a number of features attracting a wide range of visitors to the park.</p>

            <p>Although the bandstand is still in full use it now requires a certain amount of major renovation work to preserve its original feature and character. Denton and Audenshaw District Assembly has carried out an initial survey to determine the extent of the work needed and secured Heritage Lottery Fund with the support from the Local History Society, ward members and the local MP.</p>
            <p>The restoration work is due in January 2007 for a period of 12 weeks and will ensure the heritage of the Town is not lost and will be enjoyed for many years to come.</p>

Following consultation with users of the playground designs had been agreed which include exciting new equipment for both toddlers and older children.

            <p>However, it has been recognised that this section of the park is now showing signs of wear and tear and Tameside MBC have been successful in their bid to secure funding from Barclay's &lsquo;Space for Sport'. This was made possible with the efforts from the Friends of Victoria Park, Groundwork Tameside and Andrew Gwynne MP. The funding will assist in carrying out renovation work to this area which will offer a number of sporting activities for all ages to enjoy.</p>

<h4>Other Initiatives</h4>
<p><strong>Tameside In Bloom</strong></p>
<p>Victoria Park has been an important part of successive entries into the annual North West in Bloom competition. The standards of management and maintenance to be found in the park, based on the Green Flag criteria, have demonstrated to North West in Bloom Judges the importance that Tameside MBC attaches to high quality parks and green spaces.</p>
<p>In 2005 Tameside was awarded first place in the Large Cities category of the competition and entered in the National Britain in Bloom competition in 2006, coming 2nd and again came first in the North West Large Cities category. Victoria Park was again a central part of Tameside's entry.</p>

<h3><a name="3"></a>3. Vision for Victoria Park </h3>
<p><strong><em>&quot;We want Tameside to be an attractive and environmentally friendly place to live, work and visit. We are committed to working with local communities to protect and improve our surroundings to make Tameside a cleaner and more accessible place for current and future generations&quot;.</em></strong></p>
<p>This statement is the District Assembly's vision for the future of Victoria Park. The statement is taken from Tameside's Community Strategy 2003/ 2013 where one of the key themes is &lsquo;An Attractive Borough' and was identified via extensive consultation with both local residents and businesses.</p>
<p>The main aims of managing and improving Victoria Park are the eight standards set out in the Green Flag criteria, which are:</p>
<ul class="square">
    <li title="*">A Welcoming Place </li>
    <li title="*">Healthy, Safe and Secure </li>
    <li title="*">Clean and Well Maintained </li>
    <li title="*">Sustainability </li>
    <li title="*">Conservation and Heritage </li>
    <li title="*">Community Involvement </li>
    <li title="*">Marketing </li>
    <li title="*">Management </li>
</ul>
<h3><a name="4"></a>4. Strategic Context </h3>
<br />
<h4>Strategies and Policies </h4>
<p>Tameside's parks and open spaces are an integral part of the public areas of the borough and are managed in line with the Council's wider strategies and policies. Below are listed a number of such strategies and policies which have particular relevance to all Tameside's parks including Victoria Park.</p>
<p><strong>Community Strategy</strong></p>
<p>Residents throughout Tameside were asked what their priorities were for the Borough, from their views six key themes were identified, which formed the basis for Tameside's Community Strategy 2003/ 2013.</p>
<p>The themes were:</p>
<ul class="square">
    <li title="*">Supportive Communities </li>
    <li title="*">A Safe Environment </li>
    <li title="*">A Prosperous Society </li>
    <li title="*">A Learning Community </li>
    <li title="*">A Healthy Population </li>
    <li title="*">An Attractive Borough </li>
</ul>
<p>Victoria Park plays a vital role in fulfilling these priorities for the people of Denton and Tameside as a whole. In planning the management of the park over the next three years, each of the priorities have been taken into account as shown below.</p>
<ul class="square">
    <li title="*"><strong>Supportive Communities <br />
    <br />
    </strong><strong></strong>We will help to encourage a strong community spirit by providing a park, which has a wide range of facilities and can be enjoyed by people of all backgrounds and interests<br />
    <br />
    </li>
    <li title="*"><strong>A Safe Environment <br />
    <br />
    </strong><strong></strong>We want Victoria Park to be a place where all members of the community feel safe and secure and we will support this through; good design, high standards of maintenance, staff working onsite and encouragement of high levels public use.<br />
    <br />
    </li>
    <li title="*"><strong>A </strong><strong>Prosperous Society <br />
    <br />
    </strong><strong></strong>A well maintained and attractive park adds to the overall appearance of Denton, which helps in attracting more visitors to the area and bringing in more investments and jobs. Victoria Park is recognised as a prime civic space and important to the overall development programme for the Denton Town Centre development.<br />
    <br />
    </li>
    <li title="*"><strong>A Learning Community <br />
    <br />
    </strong><strong></strong>We want to encourage schools and local groups to see Victoria Park as a place where children, students and others can come to keep learning throughout their lives. We will do this by listening to resident's views and providing appropriate facilities and opportunities for learning where possible. We use the development of the park as a learning opportunity for the local community in particular for environmental and heritage projects.<br />
    <br />
    </li>
    <li title="*"><strong>A Healthy Population <br />
    <br />
    </strong><strong></strong>The park provides a welcoming place for people to relax and exercise and we shall continue to manage and improve these facilities to make Denton a healthier place to live and work.<br />
    <br />
    </li>
    <li title="*"><strong>An Attractive Borough <br />
    <br />
    </strong><strong></strong>Victoria Park is an attractive, clean centre for leisure and relaxation in the heart of Denton and we shall make sure through our maintenance, that these standards are maintained and improved, but more than this we want to ensure that the park is also an environmentally friendly &lsquo;green space' with standards that can be sustained both for today's visitors and those in future years. For this reason we have drawn up a sustainability charter for Victoria Park which will guide our management of the park (<a href="#app1">See Appendix 1</a>). The Community Strategy can be viewed at:- <a href="http://www.tameside-strategic-partnership.org.uk/tsp-links.htm">www.tameside-strategic-partnership.org.uk/tsp-links.htm</a> <img class="absmiddle" alt="Link to External Website" src="/tmbc_images/include/external_link.gif" /> </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Green Space Strategy </strong></p>
<p>Tameside MBC is currently developing a Green Space Strategy for the whole of the borough. The aim of the strategy is &quot;To secure a level of high quality design, long term maintenance and accessibility throughout the network of green spaces in Tameside&quot;.</p>
<p>The strategy will seek to determine standards of management, which the Council shall aim to provide for the range of green space across the borough.</p>
<p>Victoria Park is clearly an important park of our network of green space and the Green Flag criteria shall be included within the management standards. It is anticipated that the strategy shall be produced in a draft form for further public consultation in 2006.</p>
<p><strong>Tameside's Park Strategy </strong></p>
<p>A parks strategy was produced in 1997 to govern the management of all Tameside's parks. This is currently under review as part of the development of Green Space Strategy for the Borough. When completed, conclusion from the new strategy will be fed into the Victoria Park Plan.</p>
<p><strong>Health and Safety Policy </strong></p>
<p>This policy has been developed to ensure the health and safety of all residents of the borough, employees and members of the Council in connection with the management of public facilities throughout Tameside. The policy covers all aspects of the management of Victoria Park and requires that risk assessments are carried out and safety procedures developed for all work and events within the park. The policy together with up to date risk assessments may be viewed by request to the Denton and Audenshaw Town Manager.</p>
<p><strong>Children's Play Policy </strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>This policy guides play provision for children across Tameside. The policy aims to ensure that a suitable amount and standard of play facilities are provided by the Council and are really accessible to children and their parents and carers.</p>
<p>The policy has identified the playground in Victoria Park as one of ten strategic playgrounds across the borough and it is under the direction of this policy that the parks playground is currently undergoing improvement</p>
<p><strong>Dog Fouling Policy </strong></p>
<p>Tameside Council has now designated land under The Dogs (fouling of land) Act 1996. The designated land includes road, footpaths, school playing fields, sports fields and parks. It is an offence for a dog owner not to clean up after their dog in these areas. Failure to comply can result in a prosecution and fine of up to &pound;1,000, Tameside Patrollers patrol all parks and will issue fixed penalty notices should the need arise.</p>
<p><strong>Tree and Woodland Policy </strong></p>
<p>This policy has been developed to guide the management of trees and woodlands throughout Tameside. A tree survey has been carried out in the park from which a work programme is developed to ensure that the Council fulfils its statutory obligations to maintain a safe and healthy stock of trees in public areas. In line with the policy's aim to maintain and where possible, increase the tree cover of the borough, trees which may need to be removed from the park from time to time shall be replaced, although due to the size of Victoria Park there is limited scope for significantly increasing the tree cover on site. Future planting will be used as an opportunity to increase the diversity and range of the tree stock.</p>
<p><strong>Other Policies </strong></p>
<p>In addition to the priorities identified in the Community Strategy we shall also draw on the Council's other policies and strategies where these aid us in managing the park e.g. The Children's Play Policy guiding play provision for children and the dog Fouling Policy which provides a means of dealing with the problems of dog fouling.</p>
<h4>Continuous Improvement </h4>
<p>A culture of continuous improvements (CI) is embedded in the work of the Council, with all Service Units and individual members of staff being encouraged to review and continuously improve their service to the community.</p>
<p>The Horticultural CI group meet regularly which includes all the Operations Managers and Grounds Maintenance Staff. The aim of the group is to improve the standards of the Council's Horticultural operations throughout the Borough and in this instance to the benefit of Victoria Park and its uses.</p>
<h4>Raising the Standards </h4>
<p>A culture of continuous improvements (CI) is embedded in the work of the Council, with all Service Units and individual members of staff being encouraged to review and continuously improve their service to the community.</p>
<p>The Horticultural CI group meet regularly which includes all the Operations Managers and Grounds Maintenance Staff. The aim of the group is to improve the standards of the Council's Horticultural operations throughout the Borough and in this instance to the benefit of Victoria Park and its uses.</p>
<p>Through the comprehensive Performance Assessment (CPA) which is assessed by the Audit Commission Tameside MBC, since 2003 has been measured as &lsquo;4 Star' in the way that it serves its local people.</p>
<p>This along with CI, Charter Mark and IIP underpins the management of Victoria Park.</p>
<h3><a name="5"></a>5. A Welcoming Place </h3>
<p>The overall impressions for any member of the community approaching and entering the park and grounds should be positive and inviting, regardless of the purpose for which they are visiting.</p>
<h4>Objectives: </h4>
<ol class="alpha">
    <li title="*">Good, safe access for all. </li>
    <li title="*">Good park signage, internally and externally. </li>
</ol>
<h4>How the objectives are met: </h4>
<ol class="alpha">
    <li title="*"><strong>Good, safe access for all. </strong><br />
    <br />
    There are three main entrances into the grounds which are all easily accessible for both pedestrians and disabled visitors. The grounds are full Disability Discrimination Act compliant. <br />
    <br />
    Health and Safety surveys are carried out annually and any defects addressed. Also the resident Gardener reports any potential hazards to the Operations Manager.<br />
    <br />
    The three main entrances are: <br />
    <br />
    <ul class="square">
        <li title="*">Victoria Street </li>
        <li title="*">Acre Street </li>
        <li title="*">Jubilee Square - (This entrance does have a ramp for safe access for wheelchairs and prams).<br />
        <br />
        </li>
    </ul>
    </li>
    <li title="*"><strong>Good signage </strong><br />
    <br />
    Road signs are situated at various locations throughout the Town and new fingerposts around the Town have recently been installed, which directs visitors to various attractions and amenities within the Town including Victoria Park.<br />
    <br />
    A new notice board has been erected at the Jubilee Square entrance which informs visitors of forthcoming events and any relevant information. This is included within the Action Plan (Appendix 2). There are also fingerposts within the park again directing visitors to various places. </li>
</ol>
<h3><a name="6"></a>6. Healthy, Safe and Secure </h3>
<p>Effective management of the safety aspects of an area helps give visitors the confidence to use and enjoy Victoria Park. A well managed site, where vandalism is quickly repaired, also helps to make people think twice before committing wilful damage and helps in the presentation of a well cared for site.</p>
<h4>Objectives: </h4>
<ol class="alpha">
    <li title="*">Ensure the Health and Safety of all visitors and staff </li>
    <li title="*">To provide a clean environment </li>
</ol>
<h4>How the objectives are met: </h4>
<ol class="alpha">
    <li title="*"><strong>Safe environment. <br />
    <br />
    </strong>The grounds are currently maintained by a full time member of staff, who is supported by the Operations Supervisor and the Grounds Maintenance Team, which ensures the grounds are maintained and managed to a high standard.<br />
    <br />
    The area is inspected daily for damage and reported promptly to the Operations Manager/ Supervisor or Playground Manager depending on the nature of the damage. Repairs are monitored by the resident Gardener and/ or the Environment Officer whom ensures this is completed satisfactory.<br />
    <br />
    The children's play area is inspected daily by the parks staff and any hazards dealt with &ndash; faults with the equipment are rectified by a specialist Playground Maintenance Team. Weekly reports are filed which allow action to be monitored. The inspections procedures are currently under review to ensure we continue to improve and challenge existing procedures. Again the resident Gardener and/ or the Environment Officer will monitor that all faults are rectified in a timely manner.<br />
    <br />
    An annual inspection of the grounds is carried out in conjunction with a Health and Safety Advisor to monitor existing procedures and highlight any areas requiring attention. Recommendations are implemented by the Management Team.<br />
    <br />
    Risk Assessments have been undertaken for all maintenance operations within the grounds and suitable work methods developed. In addition a Risk Assessment is carried out prior to any event in the grounds to ensure public and staff safety.<br />
    <br />
    Staff are on call seven days a week to respond to any occurrences which may affect the health and safety of visitors, including 24 hour call out system for emergencies involving dangerous trees. Emergencies can be reported by phoning 0161 342 2222 at any time (Minicom 0161 342 3009).<br />
    <br />
    A monthly inspection of the park by the Management Team identifies any general health and safety concerns which are then dealt with appropriately.<br />
    <br />
    </li>
    <li title="*"><strong>Clean Environment <br />
    <br />
    </strong>In line with the Councils Dog Fouling Policy the park operates a policy of &lsquo;No Dog Fouling' which is sign posted throughout the park and fencing prevents entry by dogs to the playground. There is a Policy of having no dog bins within the grounds as we expect the owners to clean up and dispose of their dogs foul. The Tameside Patrollers regularly visit this site and will enforce the policy as and when the need arises.<br />
    <br />
    The District Assembly has recently launched a Dog Fouling Campaign and is working closely with the Patrollers to raise awareness amongst dog owners.<br />
    <br />
    A banner is situated at various parks and open spaces around the area and leaflets are distributed to the surrounding properties and also to the dog walkers within the grounds by the Patrollers (See Appendix 3).<br />
    <br />
    The Patrollers will carry out spot checks at the parks and increase their presence at peak dog walking times such as early mornings and evenings.<br />
    <br />
    The Tameside Patrollers whom are employed by Tameside MBC Community Safety Unit, regularly patrol Victoria Park at various times of the day.<br />
    <br />
    Should the need arise, the Patrollers will tackle anti social behaviour and issue fixed penalty notices to people who allow their dogs to foul the park and drop litter. Most importantly they build a good rapport with park users which offers a great sense of well being and security. </li>
</ol>
<h3><a name="7"></a>7. Clean and Well Maintained </h3>
<p>The District Assembly is committed to providing a clean and well maintained area for all its visitors.</p>
<h4>Objectives: </h4>
<ol class="alpha">
    <li title="*">To keep the area free of litter, waste and graffiti </li>
    <li title="*">To manage and maintain high quality landscape areas </li>
    <li title="*">Ground, buildings and equipment are well maintained </li>
</ol>
<h4>How the objectives are met: </h4>
<ol class="alpha">
    <li title="*"><strong>Litter free <br />
    <br />
    </strong>The resident Gardener picks up litter on a daily basis and also ensuring litterbins are emptied. Any damaged bins are reported and replaced.<br />
    <br />
    The Tameside Patrollers patrol the grounds regularly and monitor the litter and will secure a fixed penalty notice on any members of the public found dropping their litter.<br />
    <br />
    Graffiti is reported to the relevant service i.e. Playground Team, Operations Manager etc. and removed as soon as possible.<br />
    <br />
    </li>
    <li title="*"><strong>High quality landscape maintenance <br />
    <br />
    </strong>The flowerbeds are planted twice yearly together with the tubs which are located around the grounds. Some of the grass areas are boxed mowed with the larger areas mowed by the ride on. Shrubs and hedges are frequently attended to, three of our Arboriculture Unit carryout ad hoc work as necessary. The resident Gardener also cuts and maintains the bowling green and through the Horticultural CI Group implements landscape improvements.<br />
    <br />
    </li>
    <li title="*"><strong>Grounds, building and equipment <br />
    <br />
    </strong>The building and structures are regularly inspected and a record kept of the inspections. Any repair or improvements work identified is built into a Rolling Programme.<br />
    <br />
    Plant and equipment (mowers etc) is maintained to a high standard in accordance with the Health and Safety Policy, by our Central Team at Tame Street, Stalybridge.<br />
    <br />
    Any faults or damage are reported to the Operations Manager/ Supervisor, Environment Officer or Playground Manager depending on the nature of the damage and this will be monitored to ensure repairs are completed. <br />
    <br />
    The Management Team also carryout a monthly site visit to identify areas for improvement and monitor and log any damage or faults. </li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Ladies Pavilion</strong></p>
<p>Day to day cleansing carried out by Club Members. Any necessary structural or service repairs are funded through the Denton and Audenshaw District Assembly's budget.</p>
<p><strong>Staff Cabin</strong></p>
<p>The day to day cleansing and maintenance is carried out by the park staff.</p>
<p>Structural and service repairs and maintenance are undertaken via the Denton and Audenshaw District Assembly's budget.</p>
<p><strong>Bandstand</strong></p>
<p>Periodic maintenance and refurbishment is undertaken as required via the Denton and Audenshaw District Assembly's budget. An annual inspection is carried out by a qualified surveyor, which allows any structural faults to be identified and repaired.</p>
<p><strong>War Memorial</strong></p>
<p>An annual cleaning and minor repairs programme is carried out and funded via a dedicated Corporate budget for war memorials, should large scale repairs be required these would be funded from the Corporate Capital Programme. </p>
<h3><a name="8"></a>8. Sustainability </h3>
<p>In line with its commitment to Local Agenda 21, the Denton and Audenshaw District Assembly continuously takes account of the principles of sustainability in its management of Victoria Park.</p>
<h4>Objectives: </h4>
<ol class="alpha">
    <li title="*">Pesticide use should be minimised and justified. </li>
    <li title="*">Peat free should be widely used. </li>
    <li title="*">Waste material in the grounds should be recycled and support Local Agenda 21. </li>
</ol>
<h4>How the objectives are met: </h4>
<ol class="alpha">
    <li title="*"><strong>Use of pesticides <br />
    <br />
    </strong>Pesticides are not distributed within Victoria Park unless there are no viable alternatives that can be found.<br />
    <br />
    If herbicides are required a glyphosate based product would be chosen as a last option. The product distribution would be limited and only be used as a spot rather than a blanket cover treatment.<br />
    <br />
    Glyphosate as an active ingredient is chosen as it is inactivated when it comes in contact with the soil, as a herbicide is a very effective systemic and is far less toxic than other forms of herbicide.<br />
    <br />
    Insecticides and fungicides are also applied as a last resort within Victoria Park and would only be used on fine, sports turf as a spot treatment if the condition has spread out of control and other methods of treatment have failed.<br />
    <br />
    All of Tameside Metropolitan Borough Council staff who apply pesticides within Victoria Park have passed their National Proficiency Test Council Pesticide Certificate of Competence, PA1 Foundation Module and PA6 Handheld Applicators.<br />
    <br />
    </li>
    <li title="*"><strong>Using Peat Free <br />
    <br />
    </strong>In recent years Denton Nursery has increasingly reduced its consumption of peat based composts, replacing them with either peat free or peat reduced products. Denton Nursery has carried this out to comply with the Green Flag Award Scheme by using peat free products, but also for sustainability reasons. These reasons include helping to reduce the extraction of peat from our remaining peat-lands and the reuse of recycled composted green waste. Denton Nursery has tried various different peat free or reduced products over the years and are always looking at new alternatives on the market. The Nursery has grown plants for the Green Flag parks using these products for a number of years and has always prided itself on the crops that are produced.<br />
    <br />
    </li>
    <li title="*"><strong>Recycling Material <br />
    <br />
    </strong>All arboricultural waste including large trunks are now split and chipped with the resultant chippings used as mulch on planted beds across the borough reducing the use of herbicide.<br />
    <br />
    All green waste generated in the park is collected from containers by dedicated Tameside staff to be composted centrally by Greater Manchester Waste. GMW then produce a product that is dark brown in colour, similar to topsoil and consists primarily of organic matter such as vegetable matter, paper, card and mineral substances including stone and grit. The material produced is ideal for composting and improving growing conditions for plants and trees.<br />
    <br />
    Plastic containers used in the growing of bedding plants for the park are either reusable or recyclable, Denton Nursery also trialled peat free Jiffy pots in 2006.<br />
    <br />
    Use of recycled materials in the choice of parks furniture e.g. benches and containers.<br />
    <br />
    Due to the size of the Park and restrictions to vehicle access it is not considered feasible to introduce public recycling facilities within the park but these are available nearby in the Town. <br />
    <br />
    For further information on recycling in Tameside and Local Agenda 21 please see link below: <br />

<h3><a name="9"></a>9. Conservation and Heritage </h3>
<p>The value of Victoria Park lies in its heritage and surrounding area coupled with the wildlife, which is encouraged to the grounds.</p>
<h4>Objectives: </h4>
<ol class="alpha">
    <li title="*">To encourage and enhance various habitats such that they achieve their maximum value for wildlife. </li>
    <li title="*">To manage and maintain the building and heritage within the grounds for the benefit of the whole community. </li>
</ol>
<h4>How the objectives are met: </h4>
<ol class="alpha">
    <li title="*"><strong>Habitat management <br />
    <br />
    </strong>Due to the size, location and character of the site, the opportunities to provide suitable habitats for wildlife are not as great in Victoria Park as in some other parks. Nevertheless, various practices and initiatives have been introduced to promote the wildlife of the park.<br />
    <br />
    Virtual elimination of the use of pesticides in the parks results in a greater variety of insects, which in turn provides more food for birds visiting and nesting in the park. The presence and maintenance of a number of larger trees, in particular native species such as birches and limes also increases the food and shelter available to allow a number of birds to live and raise young in the park.<br />
    <br />
    To encourage this further, nest boxes for birds were set up in 2005 together with a number of bat boxes to provide additional roosts within the park for bats which use the park as a feeding ground.<br />
    <br />
    To provide more habitats for smaller creatures, small piles of logs have been placed in quieter areas around the park to provide a habitat for grounddwelling insects and so encourage animals into the park which feed on these such as shrews and hedgehogs.<br />
    <br />
    The opportunity to include nectar-bearing plants, plants with seeds and berries and food plants for butterfly and moth caterpillars shall also be considered when restocking shrubberies and other planted areas.<br />
    <br />
    </li>
    <li title="*"><strong>Buildings and Heritage</strong><br />
    <br />
    Since its opening in 1913 Victoria Park has lost a number of features such as the drinking fountain and archways, which were originally found on the site. It is important that remaining structures and features are maintained and restored where required.<br />
    <br />
    An equally important part of the heritage of the park is its &lsquo;atmosphere' and its traditional use by all members of the community. The District Assembly have therefore decided to adopt an open access policy as far as possible and to allow pedestrian entry into all parts of the park at all times.<br />
    <br />
    Where fences and gates are present, however, it is important that they are maintained in good order and a programme of refurbishment of all main entrances to the park has been undertaken over the past few years.<br />
    <br />
    The Grade II listed bandstand is a central feature of the park, although now in need of restoration works. A full survey of the bandstand was carried out in 2005 and a bid for Heritage Lottery Funding has been successful to allow restoration to be undertaken, which will commence in January 2007.<br />
    <br />
    The restoration works will take approximately three months to complete and the total costs will be in the region of &pound;60,000.<br />
    <br />
    The District Assembly have supported the Friends of Victoria Park, Groundwork Tameside and Andrew Gwynne MP in their successful bid in obtaining funding from the Barclay's &lsquo;Space for Sport' for the multi use area. This are will soon offer a wide variety of informal ball games which will be enjoyed by all ages. The total costs for this project is &pound;80,000.<br />
    <br />
    The War Memorial, although now a &lsquo;listed' structure is also an important part of Victoria Parks heritage and minor maintenance works are carried out each year to maintain its appearance. A survey is also carried out every twelve months to identify any larger structural work that may need to be undertaken.<br />
    <br />
    All other features both original and more modern, which contribute to the ever developing heritage of the park, are also included in regular maintenance works. </li>
</ol>
<h3><a name="10"></a>10. Community Involvement </h3>
<p>Victoria Park exists for the benefit of the local community and Denton and Audenshaw District Assembly is keen to encourage all members of the community to use the park and feel it is &lsquo;their' park.</p>
<p><strong>Objectives: </strong></p>
<ol class="alpha">
    <li title="*">To capture and use the views of the community. </li>
    <li title="*">To involve the community in the management of the area. </li>
    <li title="*">To arrange various events for the community to enjoy. </li>
</ol>
<p><strong>How the objectives are met: </strong></p>
<ol class="alpha">
    <li title="*"><strong>Views of the community <br />
    <br />
    </strong>Although it is already a popular and well-used park, it is important to keep in touch with the ideas and needs of local people.<br />
    <br />
    In order to draw up meaningful proposals for management of the park consultation is essential to identify the views of local residents, park users and visitors alike. In addition to the wider consultation carried out for policies such as the Community Strategy we have gained the views of residents regarding parks in a number of ways:<br />
    <br />
    <ul class="square">
        <li title="*">Citizen 2000 panel September &ndash; October 2003, July 2004 and December 2005 &ndash; overall, statistical view of the use of parks and playing fields generally by TMBC Policy and Equality Unit. Further details on the panel may be viewed on the following link: <a href="http://www.tameside.gov.uk/corpgen1/citizen2000/citizenindex.htm">www.tameside.gov.uk/corpgen1/citizen2000/citizenindex.htm</a> </li>
        <li title="*">Individual customer surveys carried out in Victoria Park in October 2001 and February 2003. </li>
        <li title="*">Formal and informal discussions with particular interest groups and their members including the Young Peoples Centre, Bowling Clubs and Friends of Victoria Park. </li>
        <li title="*">Enquiries made at Denton and Audenshaw District Assembly meetings. </li>
        <li title="*">Views gained via the Council's Corporate Complaints system. </li>
    </ul>
    <br />
    The main points highlighted in these surveys were:<br />
    <br />
    Victoria Park is the third most used park in Tameside behind Stamford Park and Hyde Park.<br />
    <br />
    In the Citizen 2000 survey (2003), Victoria Park showed the highest satisfaction levels of all parks for cleanliness (90% satisfaction) and general upkeep (95%) and the second highest satisfaction level for facilities (68%).<br />
    <br />
    The Citizen 2000 survey (2003) showed Victoria Park as the most improved of all Tameside parks.<br />
    <br />
    This improvement was also borne out by the individual park surveys, which also showed improvement across all areas with the exception of toilet provision.<br />
    <br />
    The questions in the Citizen 2000 surveys in 2004 and 2005 centered on the wider use of green spaces. Although valuable information was gained on the general use of parks the surveys were not designed to give detailed feedback on individual parks. The last survey for Victoria Park was carried out in March 2006.<br />
    <br />
    Results from all these surveys are taken into account by the Town Manager and his team when planning improvements and new developments within the park.<br />
    <br />
    </li>
    <li title="*"><strong>Community involvement <br />
    <br />
    </strong>In order to draw together representatives from a range of different users of the park, the Friends of Victoria Park Group was set up in 2001 with its own constitution. As well as discussing the park and its use with the Town Manager and his team, friends groups are often able to apply for funds to improve the park which are not available to the local Council and the Friends of Victoria Park has successfully obtained funding from Barclay's &quot;Space for Sport&quot; scheme to refurbish the multi-use area which is extremely popular with older children and youths. New members to the group are always welcome and anyone interested in joining should contact the Secretary, Mr. Derek Bishop through the Denton and Audenshaw Town Manager.<br />
    <br />
    Again the Friends of Victoria Park with the Denton Local History Society have successfully secured funding for the restoration of the bandstand, which is due to start in January 2007 and should be completed by April 2007. As part of the funding the Local History Society will be providing information about the history of the park, which will be placed in the information notice boards as well as providing an information pack to the local schools.<br />
    <br />
    Although a popular and well-used site, Victoria Park does not, at the moment, have a sheltered area where visitors could meet and perhaps enjoy some light refreshments although the adjacent Town Centre shops provide an adequate range of facilities. However, discussions are currently underway with the Aged Persons Welfare Centre, which is situated alongside the park off Market Street to develop a community run cafe. It is hoped to improve access from the park to the centre and operate not-for-profit light catering and community facilities for all visitors to the park.<br />
    <br />
    </li>
    <li><strong>Community Events in the Park</strong><br />
    <br />
    The park already attracts a wide range of visitors to its facilities &ndash; Bowling Teams are based and play at the park, children and their parents enjoy visits to the playground, older children and youths make use of the multi-sports area for informal sports and as a meeting place and the park is used by many people as a pleasant place to relax and enjoy the attractive surroundings.<br />
    <br />
    Events such as the concerts held at the bandstand and the annual Service of Remembrance at the War Memorial bring the community together throughout the year whilst organizations such as local schools and the adjacent Denton Young People's Centre make use of the park for their own activities. </li>
</ol>
<h3><a name="11"></a>11. Marketing </h3>
<p>Victoria Park is a valued part of Denton Town Centre and the District Assembly is keen to ensure that local residents are kept informed about the park and its development and also that people around Tameside are made aware of the park and encouraged to visit.</p>
<h4>Objectives: </h4>
<ol class="alpha">
    <li title="*">To provide a range of information to promote Victoria Park </li>
</ol>
<h4>How the objectives are met: </h4>
<ol class="alpha">
    <li title="*"><strong>Providing a range of information <br />
    <br />
    </strong>Opportunities are taken to promote the park in a variety of ways including:
    <ol>
        <li>Tameside MBC website - The Park and its facilities are listed on the public website: <a href="http://www.tameside.gov.uk/parks/index.html">http://www.tameside.gov.uk/parks/index.html</a> </li>
        <li>The Green Flag website - As dates are confirmed for the summer concerts and other events these shall be put on the Events Calendar operated by the Green Flag Organisation. See link below for Green Flag site: <a href="http://www.greenflagaward.org.uk/">http://www.greenflagaward.org.uk/</a> <img class="absmiddle" alt="Link to External Website" src="/tmbc_images/include/external_link.gif" /> </li>
        <li>Victoria Park is included in a list of Tameside's parks published twice each year in the magazines &quot;Retired and Living in Oldham and Tameside&quot; and &quot;Family Life in Oldham and Tameside&quot;. </li>
        <li>News and developments regarding the park are regularly presented to and discussed at the District Assembly meetings. Minutes of the meetings are available to view on the link below: <a href="http://www.tameside.gov.uk/districtassembly/dentonaudenshaw">www.tameside.gov.uk<font face="Arial" size="2">/districtassembly/dentonaudenshaw</font> </a></li>
        <li>Posters giving information about events in the park are placed on notice boards within the park and on public notice boards in the Town Hall, Libraries, and Community Centre's etc. </li>
        <li>As part of Tameside's entry into Britain in Bloom in 2006, a series of information leaflets were produced covering a number of Tameside's parks. Victoria Park shall be included within this series, which is due to be available in the summer. The leaflets will be available at all public outlets and shall be displayed on the parks notice boards. </li>
        <li>The new leaflet and the Victoria Park Management Plan is also available on-line at Tameside's public website. </li>
        <li>In association with the Tameside Third Sector Coalition (T3SC), Tameside MBC has developed the Tameside Network for Green and Open Spaces (TNGOS). This is a network of community groups, which meet to promote green spaces across Tameside. At events organised by TNGOS, opportunities are taken to promote the Borough's parks including Victoria Park as was done at the Festival of Healthy Living held in May 2005 at Ashton Town Hall. A similar event is due to be staged in May 2006. </li>
        <li>The Green Flag logo is now incorporated as a watermark on all Denton and Audenshaw District Assembly correspondence. </li>
        <li>Tameside &lsquo;What's On' is an Authority wide publication which includes Victoria Park as an events venue. </li>
        <li>The Tameside Reporter and Advertiser are both used for articles and advertisements about the park. </li>

<h3><a name="12"></a>12. Management </h3>
<br />
<h4>Management of the Park </h4>
<p>Responsibility for the overall management of Victoria Park lies with the Denton and Audenshaw District Assembly under the direction of the Denton and Audenshaw Town Manager.<br />
<br />
The Town Manager is assisted in the management of the park by his team including an Assistant Town Manager, an Environmental Officer responsible for day to day management of green spaces in the Town, an Operations Manager responsible for grounds maintenance work on all green sites and administrative assistance.<br />
<br />
This management team, along with the grounds senior Gardener, holds a monthly meeting at the park, at which ongoing maintenance and future developments are planned and monitored.<br />
<br />
All current and proposed work and events within the grounds are included within the Denton and Audenshaw Town Plan produced each year by the Town Manager and agreed by the District Assembly. The individual Town Plans in turn are incorporated into the wider Business Plan, which covers the whole of Tameside's District Assembly Service.<br />
<br />
The Town Plan for Denton and Audenshaw may be viewed at the link below:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.tameside.gov.uk/tmbc1/auddentownplan.pdf">http://www.tameside.gov.uk/tmbc1/auddentownplan.pdf</a> <img class="absmiddle" alt="Adobe Acrobat Format" src="/tmbc_images/include/pdf.gif" /></p>
<h4>Resources for the Park </h4>
<p>The greater part of the costs associated with management of the park are covered and controlled by the Denton and Audenshaw District Assembly in line with Tameside MBC's aim of giving responsibility for local matters to local people via the District Assemblies.<br />
<br />
If larger works are needed which fall outside the scope of the District Assembly's budget, applications may be made to the Council's capital programme and in instances where Victoria Park is included in wider initiatives such as Britain in Bloom, these schemes may provide additional funds for the park.<br />
<br />
Budgets held by the District Assembly Service for specialist areas such as children's play or tree maintenance may, at times, be directed towards the grounds for specific projects. 37<br />
<br />
Finally, opportunities are also taken, wherever possible, to apply for funds via outside grant schemes such as the Big Lottery Fund.</p>
<h4>Park Staff </h4>
<p>The majority of work within the grounds is carried out by the Denton and Audenshaw District Assembly's own staff.<br />
<br />
The park is currently maintained by one full time member of staff with the support of the grounds maintenance team as required. Specialist staff from the Arboriculture Unit and Playground Maintenance Team carry out ad hoc work as necessary. Tameside Patrollers make periodic visits to the grounds and take the lead in enforcing dog fouling byelaws.</p>
<h4>Training </h4>
<p>The Council as a whole, and this includes Victoria Park, has been awarded Investors in People. Under this all staff receive annual development reviews, which identify employee objectives and in turn training needs, which are built into subsequent Business Plans.<br />
<br />
The training needs take into account the skills required to manage Ryecroft Hall, and this has included: - NVQ training in Horticulture, Customer Care, Playground Inspections and First Aid.<br />
<br />
The Council has a central training budget, with a proportion being allocated to the District Assemblies.</p>
<h4>Putting it into Practice</h4>
<p>Information from the Community Strategy and other policies, the Green Flag criteria and judge's reports and feedback from our customer surveys have all provided guidance on managing Victoria Park, but to be worthwhile, all this information has to be put into practice in the park. In order to do this an action plan has been developed setting out proposals for the park for the next three years. The current action plan may be found overleaf. </p>
<h4>Review of the Management Plan </h4>
<p>It is intended that this plan be a working document and, as such, shall be amended as opportunities arise to carry out improvements within the grounds or if changing circumstances affect the existing proposals. The plan will also be reviewed at the end of the three years covered by the Action Plan. 38</p>
<p>The purpose of this plan is to help provide a welcoming recreational facility for the residents and visitors of Denton and the wider area. Any comments or suggestions from park users, local residents, community groups, the business community or other interested groups or individuals would be most welcome and may be forwarded to the Denton, Audenshaw and Dukinfield Town Manager:-</p>

<h3 class="center">A sustainability Charter for Victoria Park, Denton </h3>
<p>Tameside Council is committed to the principles of sustainable development and is striving to improve the quality of life of those living, working and visiting the area both now and in the future. Through the provision of services it aims to contribute to the objectives of the UK Strategy for Sustainable Development, which seeks to achieve:</p>
<ul class="square">
    <li title="*"><strong>Social progress that meets the needs of everyone. </strong></li>
    <li title="*"><strong>Effective protection of the environment. </strong></li>
    <li title="*"><strong>Prudent use of natural resources. </strong></li>
    <li title="*"><strong>Maintenance of high and stable levels of economic growth and employment. </strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Tameside MBC has produced a &lsquo;Quality of Life Strategy' which sets out an action plan to implement the Local Agenda 21 principles. This covers all aspects of the Councils responsibilities including the built environment, the natural environment, waste management and pollution. It is against the background of this strategy that the following guiding principles for Victoria Park have been developed.</p>
<h3>Guiding Principles </h3>
<p>In its management of the facilities provided at Victoria Park the Council undertakes to:</p>
<ul class="square">
    <li title="*">Reduce the consumption of natural resources, especially energy and water. </li>
    <li title="*">Where feasible, substitute non-renewable resources with renewable ones. </li>
    <li title="*">Minimise the production wastes. </li>
    <li title="*">Reuse and recycle wastes. </li>
    <li title="*">Release wastes only in forms which natural processes can assimilate. </li>
    <li title="*">Prevent pollution by minimising the use of chemicals. </li>
    <li title="*">Preserve and where possible increase the variety and diversity of species and habitats. </li>
    <li title="*">Protect natural and built up physical assets and amenities that once damaged would be impossible, difficult or very slow to restore and recreate. </li>
    <li title="*">Encourage sustainable modes of travel to and from the park. </li>
    <li title="*">Ensure all facilities are accessible to all members of the public. </li>
    <li title="*">Maintain a clean, safe and secure environment. </li>
    <li title="*">Establish mechanisms for continual liaison with users of the Park. </li>
