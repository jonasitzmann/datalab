    <td valign="top"><span class="body-text">The Mystery Plays are cycles of plays 
      in English verse dramatizing key Biblical stories from the Creation to the 
      Last Judgement. Full cycles survive from York (48 plays), Wakefield (32 
      plays), Chester (24 plays), and in a cycle of 42 plays now called 'N-Town' 
      (sometimes called 'Ludus Coventriae'), which may be of East Midlands or 
      East Anglian origin. Two plays are extant from a cycle at Coventry, and 
      single plays survive from the cycles at Newcastle, Norwich and Northampton, 
      and from Brome in Suffolk. A full cycle also survives in the Cornish language. 
      Towns and cities where records indicate dramatic activity, but no plays 
      survive, include: Aberdeen, Bath, Beverley, Bristol, Canterbury, Dublin, 
      Ipswich, Leicester, Worcester, and perhaps London and Lincoln. All the evidence 
      points to widespread staging of Biblical drama in later medieval England. 
      </span> <p class="body-text">Records suggest that the cycles were evolving 
        from the later fourteenth century, but surviving manuscripts of the texts 
        are later. The cycles were usually performed in connection with the new 
        early summer feast of Corpus Christi (instituted in 1311), the Thursday 
        after Trinity Sunday in June, and may have developed from the processions 
        held on that day in honour of the Eucharist, through which Christ remains 
        continually present to the faithful. The cycles' overall design certainly 
        emphasizes the central place in history of Christ's life, sacrifice and 
        redemption of mankind.</p>
      <p class="body-text">York and Chester records indicate that the plays were 
        performed on pageant wagons wheeled through the city streets, allowing 
        performance at certain points or 'stations' around the town. Stage directions 
        in the N-Town cycle suggest that it was not performed processionally in 
        this way. Records show that the heavy costs of the pageant carts, costumes 
        and other expenses were borne by the craft guilds of medieval towns. Guilds 
        sponsored particular plays (sometimes there was a connection between their 
        trade and the play's subject), and the players were guild members. For 
        several centuries immense amounts of money, time and effort were expended 
        on producing these cycles of Biblical plays. At Chester the cycle took 
        three days to perform, and at York the cycle could only be mounted on 
        Corpus Christi day by using all the hours of daylight at the summer equinox. 
        Mounting the cycles demanded a vast communal and civic endeavour, fuelled 
        by some inter-guild competitiveness and display, as well as by piety. 
        Performance was celebration, entertainment, and worship.</p>
      <p class="body-text">The cycle plays represent an intriguing balance between 
        the religious and the secular. Performed outdoors in English, on holidays, 
        by the laity, these Biblical plays are full of humour and vitality. Yet 
        their original authors, as their theological learning suggests, would 
        have been clerics, and it would seem that the ecclesiastical authorities 
        did not give up a hold over the text of what was performed. However, as 
        the cycles evolved, the texts of some plays were evidently rewritten, 
        and the surviving cycles have the unevenness predictable from revision 
        by various hands. The work of the so-called 'Wakefield Master' and 'York 
        Realist' who rewrote or revised some plays in those cycles, stands out 
        from the rest.</p>
      <p class="body-text">The selection of episodes for dramatization is, with 
        local variations of emphasis, strikingly common to all the surviving cycles 
        and includes:</p>
      <p class="body-text">Fall of Lucifer<br>
        Creation and Fall of Man<br>
        Cain and Abel<br>
        Noah's Flood<br>
        Abraham and Isaac<br>
        Moses<br>
        The Prophets<br>
        The Nativity (Annunciation; Shepherds; Purification; Magi; Flight into<br>
        Egypt; Massacre of the Innocents)<br>
        Baptism of Christ<br>
        Temptation of Christ<br>
        Raising of Lazarus<br>
        The Passion (Conspiracy; Judas; Last Supper; Caiphas; Trial; Crucifixion)<br>
        Resurrection<br>
        Ascension<br>
        Assumption and Coronation of the Virgin Mary<br>
        Last Judgement</p>
      <p class="body-text">Episodes from the Old Testament are dramatized because 
        they are seen to prefigure the central drama of Christ's life: the temptation 
        and fall of Adam prefigures the temptation of Christ; the murder of Abel 
        and the sacrifice of Isaac anticipate the Crucifixion; Noah's flood anticipates 
        the Last Judgement; the Prophets look forward to the Annunciation and 
        Nativity, declaring the genealogy of Christ, while Moses also anticipates<br>
        aspects of Christ's life and ministry.</p>
      <p class="body-text">The Mystery dramatists had a shrewd eye for seizing 
        on the most visualizable Biblical episodes as the focus of their plays, 
        but in this they could also exploit the ways in which their audiences 
        were steeped in a visual culture that everywhere depicted those episodes, 
        as this 'Medieval Imaginations' website is designed to illustrate.</p></td>
