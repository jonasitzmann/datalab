<strong>INTRODUCTION</strong><br>
Welcome to this slim summer Harvest, timed deliberately and exactly to
coincide with today's solar eclipse. More of a rounding-up exercise than a
measuring of seismic activity, we report here on a number of sites which
had previously escaped our notice but which have much to commend them. 
But we are not unexcited, since we are able to announce a
new, and we hope usefully memorable, redirect URL, that is, an address
which will redirect you automatically to our website. Our website address
stays the same, but if you find yourself at a computer and at a loss, we
hope that it will be easier to find us if you only remember to go to CERES.
For that is the automatic redirect address: <a href=http://go.to/ceres>http://go.to/ceres</a>.
<p>

<p>
<h2 align=center>ELECTRONIC RESOURCES</h2>
<strong>THE FOREST OF RHETORIC</strong><br>
A splendid site put together by Gideon Burton, this offers a rhetoric
manual of Quintilianian proportions, certainly filling a gap observed long
ago by CERES in our feature on Renaissance Rhetoric. The site contains
'trees' (partes orationis and general theory) and 'flowers' (figures), is
fully searchable, and makes effective use of frames.  Its hefty and
comprehensive scholarship is wielded with a light touch aimed at making
classical rhetoric comprehensible. Certainly one to bookmark if only for
its dictionary of figures of speech: <a href=http://humanities.byu.edu/rhetoric/silva.htm>http://humanities.byu.edu/rhetoric/silva.htm</a>.
<p>
<strong>GLOSSARY OF POETIC TERMS</strong><br>
Also gloriously vast is this site, 308K of poetic and prosodic terminology,
defined, illustrated, and hypertextually cross-referenced by Robert G.
Shubinski. A very useful site indeed, it is, like the above, really an
online reference book: <a href=http://web.wwa.com/~rgs/glossary.html>http://web.wwa.com/~rgs/glossary.html</a>.
<p>
<strong>E18</strong><br>
Not a new boy band or London night club, but the framework which will see
every page of every volume in the 18th century STC digitised and available
online. It is worth a view to see what we can expect for the C16-C17 in the
not too distant future. E18 invites ESTC users to request digitisation of
sets of materials currently available in Primary Source Media's microfilm
project, The Eighteenth Century. Primary Source Media will create scanned
images of materials the greatest number of ESTC users require. Digital
facsimiles of these books, pamphlets, broadsides and other materials will
be linked to their corresponding ESTC records. ESTC users can access the
images for on-screen viewing, printing, or downloading. To learn more and
to view the substantial sampling head for: <a href=http://www.e18.psmedia.com/index.html>http://www.e18.psmedia.com/index.html</a>.
<p>
<strong>PROJECT MUSE</strong><br>
One of the first of its kind, we are only now telling you about this site
because we have only just gained access via a trial subscription. A
well-presented site offering electronic full-text versions of the journals
published by Johns Hopkins UP. Its many subscribers may (and should)
include your institution, so see how far you can get at: <a href=http://muse.jhu.edu/muse.html>http://muse.jhu.edu/muse.html</a>.
<p>
At present, journals are only available from around 1994 onwards, although
the project is investigating the possibilities of archiving past issues.
But these do include <em>ELH</em>, <em>JHI</em>, <em>MLN</em>, <em>New Literary History</em>, <em>Theatre Journal</em>,
<em>Milton Quarterly</em>, <em>Philosophy and Literature</em>, and <em>Yale Journal of Criticism</em>.
<em>SEL</em> has just joined up to JHU, so it will also be available, starting with
this year's volumes.
<p>
<strong>AND JSTOR AGAIN</strong><br>
So good we must name it twice. All those promised in the last Harvest as
impending arrivals at JSTOR are now available in full digitised glory,
although, as always, the most recent issue will always be several years
old. So the collection now includes, ab initio, <em>ELH</em>, <em>MLN</em>, <em>Representations</em>,
<em>Speculum</em>, and <em>Yale French Studies</em>, as well as <em>Shakespeare Quarterly</em>, <em>RQ</em>,
and <em>JHI</em>. So, <em>ELH</em> can now be found in toto if you have access both to JSTOR
(up to 1994) and Project Muse (1994-). Remember to try both sites: <a href=http://www.jstor.org/>http://www.jstor.org/</a> and <a href=http://www.jstor.ac.uk/>http://www.jstor.ac.uk/</a>. 
<p>
<strong>ENCYCLOPEDIC CATHOLICS</strong><br>
New Advent is a massive and highly useful site, providing as its
centrepiece the whole of The Catholic Encyclopedia online. Which means
full, though not necessarily unpartisan, biographies of the likes of St
Edmund Campion, as well as articles on history and doctrine. The site also
includes the whole of Aquinas' <em>Summa</em>, copious selections from the Church
Fathers, and more recent Catholic documents. And of course a link to the
Vatican website.  Head for <a href=http://www.sni.net/advent/>http://www.sni.net/advent/</a>.
<p>
<strong>NOMEN-ERASMI</strong><br>
The Erasmus of Rotterdam Soceity has set up a new electronic discussion
list on Erasmus, Renaissance humanism, and related topics. The list's
address is <a href=mailto:nomen-erasmi@sfu.ca>nomen-erasmi@sfu.ca</a>, though to subscribe/unsubscribe you need to
send a message with your name and e-mail address to <a href=mailto:pabel@sfu.ca>pabel@sfu.ca</a>.
Discussion has so far been sporadic, tending to confirm the view that the
older lists have cornered the market.
<p>
<strong>EMLS LATEST</strong><br>
The long-delayed special issue (4.2) of <em>Early Modern Literary Studies</em> on
Literature and Geography (edited by Richard Helgerson and Joanne Woolway
Grenfell) is finally available. Also now up is the next regular issue, 5.1.
The journal has moved to Sheffield Hallam University and is now available,
as well as via the purl, Oxford, and Alberta addresses, at <a href=http://www.shu.ac.uk/emls/emlshome.html>http://www.shu.ac.uk/emls/emlshome.html</a>.
<em>EMLS</em> is now the size of the largest of paper journals, with a broad and
lively range of articles and reviews. It continues to experiment with other
formats and has just launched  a new 'Dialogues' feature.
<p>
<strong>ARDENONLINE PREVIEWS</strong><br>
[<a href=arch-4-1.htm>See Harvest IV.i</a>]<br>
The Arden Shakespeare are now offering trial access to ArdenOnline until 1
September 1999. After this time however, access will only be possible if a
subscription is purchased. To benefit from the trial access service simply
point your browser to: <a href=http://www.ardenshakespeare.com/ardenonline>http://www.ardenshakespeare.com/ardenonline</a>.
 Use the link at the top of the page which says "register for trial access",
and follow the instructions. You will be given a username and password
which you must note down for further visits to the site. 
<p>
<strong>ELECTRIFYING THE RENAISSANCE</strong><br>
A site seeking to navigate what is already out there whilst reconceiving
epistemological paradigms, on the lines of other recent work drawing
parallels between the internet revolution and early modern systems of
knowledge. Well-informed and presented with the usual links, it offers a
series of brief essays, copiously marked up with links to sites and online
articles. Although it seems to have been frozen in the bud two years ago,
it has much to commend it for seeking to present links to the many and
disparate sources of web content within a thoughtful and usable framework:
<a href=http://humanitas.ucsb.edu/depts/english/coursework/rar/index.html>http://humanitas.ucsb.edu/depts/english/coursework/rar/index.html</a>.
<p>
<strong>THE PHILOLOGICAL MUSEUM</strong><br>
Dana Sutton of the University of California at Irvine has expanded and
updated his selection of online Neo-Latin texts at
<a href=http://eee.uci.edu/~papyri/homepage/webpage.html>http://eee.uci.edu/~papyri/homepage/webpage.html</a>.
In all, fourteen authors are currently represented, including William
Alabaster, Joseph Addison, Thomas Campion, Edward Forsett, Phineas
Fletcher, and John Milton. All texts are accompanied by introductions,
notes, and English translations. Although these hypertext editions have not
felt the hand of an inspired web designer, the texts are faithful, the
translations serviceable, and the notes helpful. Sutton has also recently
prepared a bibliography of online editions of Neo-Latin texts, including
his own editions and those of many more like-minded Latinists. Head for
<a href=http://eee.uci.edu/~papyri/homepage/nltexts.html>http://eee.uci.edu/~papyri/homepage/nltexts.html</a>.
<p>
<strong>EPISTEMON</strong><br>
A site devoted to French Renaissance Literature, much of it still under
construction, but already offering etexts and other goodies:
<a href=http://www.mshs.univ-poitiers.fr/Forell/Epistemon/Epistemon.htm>http://www.mshs.univ-poitiers.fr/Forell/Epistemon/Epistemon.htm</a>.
<p>
<strong>SPEED'S MAPS</strong><br>
Maryane Horowitz's site offers John Speed's maps of regions and cities from
1611, well reproduced from hand-coloured copies. Navigable point-and-click
maps don't seem to work, but there is still much to gawp at:
<a href=http://www.oxy.edu/~horowitz/home/johnspeed/index.htm>http://www.oxy.edu/~horowitz/home/johnspeed/index.htm</a>.
<p>
<strong>BACONIANS' HEAVEN</strong><br>
If you want to believe that Bacon wrote Shakespeare, you will spend days
roaming the vasty deeps of Penn Leary's pages:
<a href=http://home.att.net/~tleary/menu.htm>http://home.att.net/~tleary/menu.htm</a>.
<p>
<strong>AND HELL</strong><br>
In the other corner, David Kathman's angelic, and equally comprehensive,
site 'The Shakespeare Authorship Page: Dedicated to the Proposition that
Shakespeare Wrote Shakespeare' at <a href=http://www.clark.net/pub/tross/ws/will.html>http://www.clark.net/pub/tross/ws/will.html</a>.
<p>
<strong>THE ENGLISH EMBLEM BOOK PROJECT</strong><br>
Based on copies of emblem books in the Penn State University Libraries'
Rare Books Room. Quarles, Whitney, Wither, et al. in full, and in high
resolution colour images to boot. Well-indexed and presented, with further
reading and good links to other sites, this is a tremendous resource:
<a href=http://emblem.libraries.psu.edu/>http://emblem.libraries.psu.edu/</a>.
<p>
<strong>RENASCENCE BACON</strong><br>
Richard Bear has added Bacon's <em>Advancement of Learning and Essayes or
Counsels Civill and Morall</em> to his unstoppable Renascence Editions
collection. Head direct to <a href=http://darkwing.uoregon.edu/~rbear/adv1.htm>http://darkwing.uoregon.edu/~rbear/adv1.htm</a> or
<a href=http://darkwing.uoregon.edu/~rbear/bacon.html>http://darkwing.uoregon.edu/~rbear/bacon.html</a>.
<p>
<strong>RILM ABSTRACTS OF MUSIC LITERATURE</strong><br>
A site whose scope and organisation will be familiar to users of BIDS or
OCLC, RILM Abstracts of Music Literature (1969-present) is the world's
largest, continuously updated bibliography of music literature. Head for
<a href=http://www.nisc.com/>http://www.nisc.com/</a> then click on 'subscribers' if (and you may find it does) your institution subscribes.
<p>
<strong>RENAISSANCE</strong><br>
<a href=http://renaissance.dm.net/>http://renaissance.dm.net/</a><br>
This is a popular site, offering copious if unscholarly pages on all
aspects of Elizabethan life. Particular pages include 'A Compendium of
Common Knowledge 1558-1603: Elizabethan Commonplaces for Writers, Actors,
and Re-enactors' (low-level fun), 'Elizabethan Heraldry' (including
comprehensive tables of coats of arms of major Elizabethan families), and
an etext of the 1679 printing of the reports of the trials which followed
the Essex Rebellion, as well as a page of links.
<p>
<strong>HISTORICAL FONTS</strong><br>
A true-type version of Baskerville with various ligatures, called Mrs
Eaves, is available from Emigre Fonts: <a href=http://www.emigre.com/EFoIMrs.html>http://www.emigre.com/EFoIMrs.html</a>.
It does not do everything it might, lacking long s, apart from in a
double-s ligature. But it is nevertheless a thing of great beauty and
historical interest, designed to simulate letter-press convincingly.
<p>
<strong>SHINE</strong><br>
Shakespeare in Europe is a project of the English Department at Basel
University. Alongside the mandatory (though decent, including links to
various Shakespearean curse generators) links page is a page telling you
about the project, but no other online content as yet. URL:
<a href=http://www.unibas.ch/shine/>http://www.unibas.ch/shine/</a>.
<p>
<strong>SHAKESPEARE AND THE STOICISM OF SENECA</strong><br>
Prof. Ben Schneider has conceived a site to support work on Shakespeare's
debt to stoic writings. It is called 'Materials for the Construction of
Shakespeare's Morals: The Stoic Legacy to the Renaissance. Major Ethical
Authorities, Indexed According to Virtues, Vices, and Characters from the
Plays, as well as Topics in Swift, Pope, and Wordsworth: The Full Texts in
English Translation, Scanned, Digitized, Commented on, and Annotated'.
Which says it all. Already fairly substantial, it includes indexed etexts
of Cicero's <em>De Officiis</em>, Seneca's <em>Moral Essays</em>, Seneca's <em>Moral Epistles</em>,
Plutarch's <em>Lives</em> translated by North (3 vols of 8), 1 volume of Plutarch's
<em>Lives</em> translated by Dryden, and Elyot's <em>Governour</em>. It will eventually also
include Florio's Montaigne, Erasmus's <em>Christian Prince</em>, Spenser's <em>The Faerie
Queene</em>, Sidney's <em>Arcadia</em>, James I's <em>Basilikon Doron</em>, and Hall's <em>Characters</em>.
URL: <a href=http://www.stoics.com>http://www.stoics.com</a>
<p>
<strong>DISSENTERS</strong><br>
ExLibris aims to provide a variety of textual and bibliographical
information. At the moment this is limited to a survey of materials about
C17 English dissenters, offering basic accounts of the genesis of the
various sects, along with extensive bibliographies: <a href=http://www.exlibris.org/>http://www.exlibris.org/</a>.
<p>
<strong>REAL BOOKS</strong><br>
There are now some excellent sites for putting you in touch with the out of
print book dealers who have the books you want. Especially recommended is
BookFinder, which searches the catalogues of hundreds of dealers, and the
websites of the competition: <a href=http://www.bookfinder.com/>http://www.bookfinder.com/</a>.
Also worth a look is the Advanced Book Exchange, which carries home pages
for many members and allows you to browse individual booksellers'
catalogues: <a href=http://www.abebooks.com/>http://www.abebooks.com/</a>.
And bibliofind, which makes it easy to register a wish list:
<a href=http://www.bibliofind.com>http://www.bibliofind.com</a>.
