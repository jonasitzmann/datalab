        Paper I was on the whole answered competently, and sometimes brilliantly. 
        There were few very weak scripts. All questions were answered by many 
        candidates, and no one question was a great deal more popular than the 
        others (although 4 and 7 perhaps led the field). </p>
<p>Question 1 (openings of long poems by Giles Fletcher, Blake, Mary Tighe and 
  Wyndham Lewis) produced some subtle and cogently argued work. Many candidates 
  discussed well the relation between poetic and divine creation in relation to 
  Fletcher, and that between inspiration and embodiment in Blake. Wyndham Lewis 
  produced some perceptive answers on tone, though candidates did not always possess 
  the analytical vocabulary needed to specify the sources of this. Mary Tighe&#8217;s 
  Psyche produced many weak answers: surprisingly few candidates responded to 
  her lightly coded references to the sexual politics of genre, though there were 
  also one or two excellent treatments here. The best answers to question 2 waited 
  to complete their analysis before deciding (if at all) that Shakespeare must 
  be superior to Dryden. There was a lot of good commentary on &#8220;rhetoric&#8221; 
  (though some cases of sheer trope-spotting unlinked to real analysis), less 
  on &#8220;action&#8221;, and least of all on &#8220;versification&#8221;, where 
  quite a number of answers offered merely the odd token scansion. Question 3 
  produced some genuinely thoughtful work, especially on Dowson and Rodefer: most 
  answers made a real attempt to answer the question about prose poems. The worst 
  answers decided in advance that these were prose poems, rather than answering 
  the question. Many answers to question 4 (superficially, perhaps, an easier-looking 
  question than some others?) were indifferent. Johnson was often reproached with 
  a lack of sincere grief, without the necessary analytical work to support such 
  judgements or to indicate how it might be possible to make them. The best treatments 
  of his elegy paid proper attention to the textual crux (&#8220;free&#8217;d&#8221;/&#8221;forc&#8217;d&#8221;). 
  Answers on Katherine Philips were, if anything, still weaker: surprisingly few 
  answers were able to get to grips with her wit. The best answers to question 
  5 took the quotation from Walter Benjamin seriously as well as critically, rather 
  than dismissing it out of hand &#8211; such a preliminary discussion often led 
  on to telling considerations of the role of detail in Bunyan. The best answers 
  on Swift dealt with register as well as with allegory. Question 6 offered a 
  simple question on a difficult poem (by Robert Sidney); weaker answers seemed 
  to have concluded that &#8220;offer a detailed critical account&#8221; meant 
  &#8220;list the formal features of this poem&#8221;, while the stronger linked 
  such attention to form with attention to poetic argument, to ambiguity of addressee, 
  and to ambivalence of mood. Question 7 elicited better answers on Ruskin than 
  on Shelley. One or two outstanding treatments of the passage from Julian and 
  Maddalo were able to specify the nature of Shelley&#8217;s couplets, but many 
  offered only the sketchiest account of his verse as verse, preferring loose 
  paraphrase. Ruskin was on the whole better dealt with: the strongest candidates 
  used the quotation from Stokes as a prompt to attend to the difficulty of separating 
  &#8220;fantasy&#8221; from &#8220;perception&#8221; in these pieces.</p>
<p>There were many different kinds of strength displayed in answers to these questions. 
  A good deal of the work for this paper was a pleasure to read, and testified 
  to the presence of a vital tradition, not only of close reading, but also of 
  close reasoning. In particular, many candidates had clearly been able to bring 
  together real absorption in textual detail with a subtle and serious grasp of 
  complex literary-critical concepts: allegory, rhetoric, &#8220;prose poem&#8221;, 
  and so on. The very best scripts did not merely evidence an eye for detail but 
  also a mind for argument. These scripts left the false antithesis between literary 
  &#8220;theory&#8221; and the &#8220;practice&#8221; of criticism trailing far 
  behind them. Many also were the kinds of weakness. Some candidates confused 
  detailed analysis with the compilation of lists, or, elsewhere, with vague paraphrase; 
  others too easily disappeared into irrelevant general reflection and lost sight 
  of the texts themselves. But good work always took real care to think carefully 
  about the questions, and to construct an argument in relation to them. </p>
<p> <br />
  <strong>Paper 2: Tragedy</strong><br />
  The quality of work for the paper was impressive overall, with the best candidates 
  able to produce answers that were comparative, wide-ranging, and adventurous. 
  A few ignored the instruction to show adequate knowledge of both the Greeks 
  and Shakespeare to their cost. While the Greeks were generally adequately dealt 
  with, there were times when Shakespeare was admitted into account reluctantly, 
  with only passing reference being made to one or two of his plays. There were 
  some interesting answers that drew on the mixed generic nature of The Winter&#8217;s 
  Tale for their argument, but few people paid attention to the fact that all 
  his plays can be evaluated on their generic hybridity. Titus Andronicus also 
  seemed to be a favoured text for mangling. This is however something that has 
  occurred down the years. Whenever there is the slightest opportunity to write 
  about language Lavinia is immediately put forward. But her and the rest of the 
  play are banalised beyond recognition. There was also little mention of the 
  specific performance contexts and implications for the discussion of the many 
  dramatic texts that were referred to. <br />
  Question 8 proved problematic for some candidates, with several taking 'nature' 
  in the Bauman quotation to mean 'human nature'. Similarly, 'identification' 
  in Q 6 was often not sufficiently clearly defined in relation to 'sympathy', 
  'empathy', 'similarity' and the like. Trouble was also courted on Q 17, when 
  candidates failed to think through the implications of a determinist author, 
  either loosely defining 'determinist' or applying the term to characters. Some 
  of the weakest work was produced in response to Q 19, with candidates taking 
  the opportunity to write about women in tragedy generally rather than engaging 
  more forcibly with the quotation about women's rights and wrongs. As a rule 
  answers that had little or no bearing on the questions were heavily penalised. 
  In several cases this was despite the fact that the answer were quite good in 
  themselves; the point is that any material has to have a direct bearing on the 
  question being attempted.</p>
<p>Students are advised to acquaint themselves with the requirements for the paper 
  set out in &#8216;Information to Candidates&#8217; in preparing for the exam. 
  Also candidates for an examination in English are expected to write competently, 
  even under examination conditions. Coherence of argument and expression were 
  rewarded; incoherence and approximation were penalised.</p>
<p><strong>Paper 3: Chaucer </strong><br />
  Candidates performed well in all parts of the Chaucer paper this year, emerging 
  with four results in the First Class and eight 2.1s, all of whom did creditable 
  work in some area of their paper. Section A, the passages for comment, was tackled 
  especially well. All of the passages on offer were attempted, and all candidates 
  were successful in correctly identifying and placing their chosen passages; 
  only one could be said to have strayed into the trap of attempting to substitute 
  a &#8216;practical criticism&#8217; reading for a commentary that related the 
  extracts to Chaucer&#8217;s work as a whole. About two-thirds of the 20 or so 
  essay questions in Section B were attempted. There were especially impressive 
  answers on Chaucer as a &#8216;philosophical&#8217; poet, and on the neglected 
  merits of some of his prose writings. Most candidates engaged enthusiastically 
  with Chaucer&#8217;s writings at a level appropriate to Part II, and only a 
  couple were tempted to fall back on what was evidently Part I work in dealing 
  with the question on his attitude to genre.</p>
<p><strong>Paper 4: Medieval Literature 1066-1500: Comedy and Performance</strong><br />
  On the whole, the quality of work for this paper was good, with some enterprising 
  and indeed spirited answers. Among the recurrent weaknesses was tendency to 
  rely upon a narrow theoretical base (little more than Bakhtin, who was mentioned 
  in almost every script) and to make uncritical generalizations about &#8216;the 
  Middle Ages&#8217;, which are themselves a massive &#8211; and questionable 
  &#8211; generalization. There were many examples of this failure of critical 
  verve and it is something that candidates in the future would do very well to 
  address. They may well find their work more interesting as a result. The scripts 
  included some good answers on the gobbets, although the pattern of choices and 
  omissions revealed that many candidates were not prepared to answer on passages 
  that required a measure of historical knowledge (there were no answers on the 
  Jankyn poem, for example, which acquires some elementary knowledge of the Ordinary 
  of the Roman mass). </p>
<p><strong>Paper 5: Special Period of English Literature, 1500-1547</strong><br />
  Fifteen students took this paper, and between them answered a very wide range 
  of questions. All candidates displayed a good knowledge of the period and its 
  literary concerns, and everyone achieved a class of 2.1 or above on the exam. 
  Candidates produced full and informed answers for question 1, although the less 
  good of these were rather generalized, and failed to engage closely enough with 
  text of the passages in question. Indeed, in the exam as a whole candidates 
  showed themselves to be perhaps more knowledgeable than analytical, with a tendency 
  to assemble second-hand evidence and claims; but the very best answers were 
  conceptually ambitious, thoughtful and well-focussed on the literary writing 
  of the period.</p>
<p><strong>Paper 6: Special Period of English Literature, 1847-1872</strong><br />
  1st: 3; 2.1: 19; 2.2: 6<br />
  The exam elicited some solid work from candidates, although there were very 
  few scripts this year which attained a standard of excellence. The weakest work 
  appeared in response to the gobbets in Section A. Candidates almost universally 
  failed to integrate effectively a close reading of each passage&#8217;s stylistic 
  and rhetorical features with attention to their historical and cultural contexts. 
  Discussion on the whole was limited to passages (c), (d), and (f), with (a), 
  (b) and (e) rather sadly neglected.</p>
<p>Answers to Section B were more equally distributed across the questions. Some 
  good work was undertaken in response to the two questions on the impact of Darwinian 
  evolutionary theory and scientific empiricism (2 and 13) and some careful and 
  well-evidenced material was also produced on detective fiction and narrative 
  structure in answer to question 10. No candidate addressed the popularity of 
  the historical novel in the Victorian period or discussed representations of 
  God in literary works &#8211; both rather surprising omissions. On the whole, 
  candidates were not able to integrate fully textual analysis and historical 
  contextualization of the material they chose to discuss, tending to demonstrate 
  strengths in only one field on critical practice. The best work was undertaken 
  on the idea of identity in response to question 11, which enabled the stronger 
  candidates to ask more probing questions about the construction of literary 
  subjectivity in the period.</p>
<p>This paper invites a particularly dense engagement with the literature of a 
  finite historical period, and depth of analysis was consequently well rewarded. 
  The candidates who performed well on this paper were able to refer to a wide 
  range of primary sources (from across the genres) and secondary material, whilst 
  simultaneously evincing an intensity of involvement with their chosen works. 
  The weakest answers were invariably those in which candidates dumped pre-prepared 
  material without close attention to the wording of the question. Prominent examples 
  of this were seen in response to question 5 in which candidates were invited 
  to discuss ideas of poetry in the period: they often chose instead to offer 
  close readings of selected poems without any substantial engagement with the 
  manifold writings on theories of poetic production in the period. Candidates 
  for this paper next year would also be well advised to read outside the corpus 
  of material covered in Faculty teaching programmes in order to enhance the diversity 
  of material they can bring to bear upon questions in the exam.</p>
<p> <br />
  <strong>Paper 7a: Shakespeare in Performance</strong><br />
  1st: 6; 2.1: 14; 2.2: 3</p>
<p>There were some fine performances this year and very few Part 2 English candidates 
  presenting less than a competent 2.1<br />
  It cannot be emphasised too strongly that thorough knowledge of Shakespeare&#8217;s 
  scripts is essential to effective work for this paper. The strongest scripts 
  gave detailed attention to the plays in relation to their performance; the weaker 
  ones tended to engage with particular performances and performance aspects while 
  ignoring the wider implications for an understanding of the plays themselves. 
  The weakest did little more than express opinions about particular productions 
  and directors.<br />
  Answers to Section A tended to be better informed and more interestingly speculative 
  than those for Section B, where weaker scripts were characterised by a narrow 
  range of reference (The Merchant of Venice, Peter Brook, Kurosawa, and Barker 
  are all significant, but contrast and comparison are valuable). Weaker scripts 
  were undermined by a tendency to take the easiest route in responding to the 
  questions - e.g. by treating qu. 7 as an invitation to show how Shakespeare 
  accepted and dealt with the limitations of his (perforce) non-realistic stage 
  rather than engaging fully with the more difficult notion of a positive anti-theatricality; 
  or, vis-a-vis qu. 20, showing that film can include direct address, overhearing, 
  etc. rather than wrestling with the real differences between stage and screen; 
  or, in qu.16, describing productions as adaptations rather than exploring actual 
  rewritings or reworkings in different media. <br />
</p>
<p><strong>Paper 7b: Spenser and his Time</strong><br />
  Most of the five candidates were individually well prepared in relation to Spenser 
  and his background. The most favoured questions were on Neoplatonism, in the 
  commentaries, and on Ireland and Elizabeth for the essays; a few candidates 
  also engaged well with pastoral. Across the whole range of scripts, however, 
  coverage was markedly narrow: Elizabeth apart, there seemed to be a general 
  reluctance to talk about the Faerie Queene at all (even the Redcrosse Knight 
  went unmentioned), and it was rare to find any discussion of Spenser&#8217;s 
  poetic qualities, even in the commentaries.</p>
<p><strong>Paper 7c: Wordsworth</strong><br />
  This paper elicited some sophisticated and well-informed work although also 
  its fair share of pedestrian and uncritical writing. As often, some answers 
  tended not to address the question but to fit the question around pre-prepared 
  material. This could result in a straining for relevance or lack of focus. The 
  passages for discussion prompted some rather general responses tapping into 
  pre-prepared material&#8212;on church history, for instance--rather than taking 
  the opportunity for text-based critical or speculative writing (no one chose 
  to write on the Derrida or Ashbery passages, or the metrical experiment of &#8216;Star 
  Gazers&#8217;). The range of work (though not of reference) was less varied 
  than one might have expected, with a focus on prosody and a tendency to equate 
  metrical effects with mimetic effects, despite the recognition that metrical 
  &#8216;passion&#8217; might be involved. Not all students were able to quote 
  with due attention to metre despite having learned passages and paid attention 
  to metre. As a consequence of this prosodic focus, as well as an emphasis on 
  the nature of philosophic poetry, the more affective and imaginative dimensions 
  of Wordsworth&#8217;s writings suffered. The better candidates, however, were 
  able to make use of interesting teaching, although the same examples and ideas 
  had a tendency to crop up across the board. While candidates showed an unusual 
  familiarity with the later Wordsworth (Excursion and Ecclesiastical or Duddon 
  sonnets), The Prelude was surprisingly neglected. Although a few wrote selectively 
  on Lyrical Ballads, &#8216;The Ruined Cottage&#8217;, or the Immortality Ode, 
  there was little apparent knowledge of the early poetry or interest in politics: 
  a return to the Victorian canon that has odd consequences given how much late 
  20thC critical writing has been based on work leading up to and including The 
  Prelude. </p>
<p> <strong>Paper 7d: Modernism and the Short Story</strong><br />
  This is a new paper, and thus the first time it has been examined. Candidates 
  handled the examination competently enough though generally without a sense 
  of adventure. They stuck to a smallish corpus of works (Mansfield, Kipling, 
  Joyce and Beckett featured a good deal) and although 19 of the 22 questions 
  were attempted, the engagement with questions was often perfunctory and answers 
  quickly defaulted to prepared material. </p>
<p>This may have something to do with uncertainty about a new paper. However, 
  there was a feeling among the Examiners that the calibre of thought and the 
  degree of engagement were not particularly high. This is a challenging paper 
  which calls for an understanding of genre, Modernism and specific authors. While 
  answers were generally accomplished in treating individual works, it was too 
  often the kind of discussion which could be transferred to a number of other 
  papers. A particular problem was the understanding of Modernism and how ideas 
  concerning it could be activated in the context of the short story. Frequently, 
  the short story was promoted as the exemplar of a cliched notion of Modernism. 
  Few candidates were able to work adroitly with the interrelations of genre and 
  period.</p>
<p><strong>Paper 8: English Moralists</strong><br />
  This was an exceptionally strong year on the Moralists paper. 25 candidates 
  sat the paper, 11 of whom were awarded Firsts for it. It is particularly cheering 
  to see that the paper attracted candidates of this quality after a couple of 
  years when the results for it were relatively poor, generating ill-founded rumours 
  that it was hard to do well on this paper.</p>
<p>The best work was quite remarkable in its sophistication, detailed knowledge, 
  and analytical acuity, but there was a great deal of good and very good work 
  as well. As usual, answers did not conform to a single template: some were impressively 
  informed historically, some were philosophically adept, some were argumentative, 
  some were largely expository &#8211; but in the large majority of the scripts 
  there was evidence of rewarding first-hand engagement with interesting texts 
  and a willingness to take the stimulation of provocation offered by the question 
  and make something of it. The small number of poorer scripts displayed the usual 
  weaknesses common to most papers: insufficient preparation, simplistic paraphrases 
  of complex ideas, and, above all, the &#8216;dumping&#8217; of prepared answers 
  on inappropriate questions.</p>
<p>Work done for the paper was impressive in range as well as in quality. Of those 
  answers principally addressed to individual moralists, the distribution was 
  as follows: 9 each on Plato, Aristotle, and Kant; 8 on Nietzsche; 5 on Hume 
  and Rousseau; 4 on Hobbes, Hegel and Mill; 2 on Augustine, Spinoza, Kierkegaard, 
  Marx, Freud, and Heidegger; and 1 on St. Paul, the Stoics, Montaigne, Locke, 
  and Wittgenstein. A few stalwarts of previous years were conspicuous by their 
  absence, such as Aquinas, Burke, and Arnold. There was ample evidence of engagement 
  with recent scholarship, but much less so of familiarity with very recent and 
  contemporary moral thinking.</p>
<p>The scripts this year confirm that committed and talented students are provided 
  with an opportunity by this paper to grapple with difficult and important ideas. 
  It is a valuable, as well as venerable, element in our Tripos, and on this showing 
  it is in extremely good health.</p>
<p><strong>Paper 9: History and Theory of Literary Criticism</strong><br />
  The paper was taken by 12 candidates of whom 10 were awarded a 2.1, one a 2.2, 
  and one a fail mark. As these results suggest, the work for the paper this year 
  was by and large competently and consistently good but with little that was 
  in any way outstanding.</p>
<p>Just under two thirds of the questions set were answered by at least one candidate, 
  with those on the sublime, mental processes, and a science of literature proving 
  (relatively speaking) the most popular. While some answers did attempt to think 
  about issues raised by the questions, most did not and tended simply to give 
  descriptive summaries of this or that critic or theorist&#8217;s writings.</p>
<p> <strong>Paper 10: The Novel</strong><br />
  1st 2; 2.1 11; 2.2 2<br />
  The average standard of scripts for this paper was decent enough, but there 
  were very few candidates who showed a full understanding of the paper&#8217;s 
  simple requirement that they show knowledge both of general issues and of particular 
  novels and novelists. On one or two occasions, for example, large theoretical 
  enquiries missed out on top marks because they didn&#8217;t bother to provide 
  any precise examples from fictional texts; and by the same token, some good 
  studies of individual authors lacked a larger dimension. The examiners must 
  concur with the note in last year&#8217;s report reminding candidates of this 
  stipulation in the paper&#8217;s rubric. The best scripts ranged well in term 
  of their primary material, and offered methodological and theoretical versatility 
  over the paper as a whole &#8211; another area in which the comparison with 
  the Tragedy paper would be pertinent. Otherwise, there was precious little attention 
  paid to pre-1800 novelists other than Defoe, Richardson, and Fielding, barring 
  a couple of passing glances at Cervantes and Smollett.</p>
<p>Once again, there was a disappointing narrowness in the range of questions 
  attempted; there were no answers on human and non-human plots, psychological 
  fiction, fictional autobiography, authenticity of experience, adaptation, &#8216;hysterical 
  realism&#8217; or rewritings, and very few attempts to engage with Question 
  15, which offered the chance to consider the novel as a material and economic 
  phenomenon. With the welcome growth of critical interest in the socio-economic 
  &#8216;history of the book&#8217;, it was disappointing to note how many students 
  still seemed happy to consider fiction as a pure, platonic form that hovered 
  above such grubby contingencies. Another area that might benefit from highlighting 
  would be narrative theory &#8211; the best students were narratologically very 
  clued-up, whereas the weakest didn&#8217;t have much of a grasp of the rhetoric(s) 
  of narration at all.</p>
<p>The weaker candidates were often also guilty of blatant question-dumping or 
  question-wrestling, where the best were capable of thinking on their feet and 
  actually framing their answers directly within the terms of the questions. Setters 
  do not agonize over the wording of questions, simply in order to have candidates 
  ignore all but one or two of those words and then &#8216;riff&#8217; on them.</p>
<p><strong>Paper 11: American Literature</strong> <br />
  Noticeably fewer candidates tackled the Twentieth Century Section A passages, 
  though all passages were attempted in a good range of combinations. The best 
  answers balanced their close reading of the passages with a good sense of context, 
  and some demonstrated a pleasing awareness of literary and cultural history. 
  Examiners noted in particular the answers on nineteenth-century culture, especially 
  print culture. Many successful candidates had clearly answered section B first, 
  but balanced their time well to write a full final answer on Section A. Weaker 
  answers tended either to describe the passages at the expense of all else, or 
  offered a context which didn&#8217;t fit well, suggesting that candidates had 
  crammed in everything they knew about the approximate period in which the text 
  was written. </p>
<p>Virtually all the questions were answered. Strong answers to Question A showed 
  imagination and a willingness to range across the paper as a whole, as well 
  as an ability to analyse texts closely. Some successful scripts demonstrated 
  such range in both answers; some were successful by balancing one answer that 
  stuck closely to a writer or small group of texts with another answer that addressed 
  American literature from a broader perspective. Examiners especially enjoyed 
  the imaginative application of some questions to a variety of writers; for example, 
  the question on paranoia took some candidates well beyond post-modern literature. 
  However, candidates should be aware of the difference between creative thinking 
  and twisting questions to talk about something else: there was disappointing 
  evidence of some &#8216;dumping&#8217; of pre-prepared answers, most notably 
  some desperate attempts to twist questions into a discussion of representations 
  of New York City. Weaker answers responded to questions as if they were an invitation 
  to &#8216;Write all you know about X&#8217;, and such candidates found a variety 
  of ways to avoid the question &#8211; discussing the quotation but not the question 
  given in the rubric or vice versa, or else seizing on a quotation as an excuse 
  to discuss its author, rather than the issue it raised.<br />
  <br />
  <strong>Paper 12a: Commonwealth and International Literature in English</strong><br />
  This is the paper&#8217;s tenth year and the end of the second five-year cycle 
  of Set Texts. In its first year the paper attracted seven candidates; this year 
  there were 35 (last year 33), making it the second most popular option in Part 
  II (after American Literature). The paper is clearly well established. The matching 
  of Set Texts with Recommended Texts from different regions introduced in the 
  second cycle has also clearly established the comparative approach that the 
  paper encourages. Thus the paper has developed and thus the examiner&#8217;s 
  task is facilitated by a clear hierarchy of assessment criteria. All candidates 
  have to cross the threshold of Section A, which tests for ability in close reading. 
  Those candidates stumbling at this step by betraying a deaf ear for tone and 
  rhythm, lack of alertness to the implications of words and images or sheer ignorance 
  of context inevitably damage their credibility when it comes to the more thematically 
  pitched essays of Section B. Those candidates who not only show that they can 
  read what&#8217;s before them but can see how to relate it to other writing 
  in the field of the paper have risen to the comparative challenge and can be 
  rewarded accordingly. Whether extending the implications of a passage in Section 
  A or writing an essay in Section B, it is not enough merely to reproduce the 
  theoretical concepts that serve to articulate the field. They must be used in 
  ways that show ability to understand abstractions, to analyze them critically 
  and to use them productively in the construction of arguments. The school from 
  which the concepts are derived, whether historical materialist, deconstructive, 
  Christian, Marxist, neo-freudean, is not what is judged, but ability in putting 
  it to literary use. Measured by these criteria, the general standard of performance 
  was, like last year, very good. The average agreed mark was 67.14 compared with 
  67.16 last year and the percentage of Firsts increased from 25% to 42.86%. There 
  were no Thirds. Out of 27 questions (including sub-sections) on the paper, 21 
  were attempted. Out of the six not attempted, two have implications for the 
  teaching for the paper. One invited candidates to draw on non-EuroAmerican critical 
  resources, which evidently no one felt equipped to do; given the rich diversity 
  of cultures in the world and the opportunities for exploration the paper provides, 
  this suggests a certain narrowness of intellectual horizons that teaching might 
  seek to expand. This was also betrayed by the number of candidates who clung 
  to their lecture notes on In an Antique Land and The Moor&#8217;s Last Sigh, 
  rather than, as last year&#8217;s report urged, using that teaching as a stimulus 
  for &#8216;truly reflective . . . writing&#8217;. The other neglected question 
  invited candidates to use the kind of resources they would have acquired from 
  the Language for Literature paper in Part I. On the other hand, there was a 
  notable and most welcome impact on some candidates&#8217; writing from two very 
  late inputs which were not at all in the mode of formal teaching, the talks 
  by Kamau Brathwaite (thanks to the Judith Wilson Committee) and Tsitsi Dangarembga 
  (thanks to the Festival of African Film). Writers communicate a vivid sense 
  of the intimacy of connection between formal invention and urgent human concerns 
  that academics can hardly rival.</p>
<p><strong>Paper 12b: Literature and Visual Culture</strong><br />
  27 candidates sat this paper, of which one was taking the Preliminary Examination 
  for a two-year Part II.</p>
<p>Three candidates answered Question 1, on the reproduction of 'Las Meninas' 
  which had been distributed, and two of these seemed well aware of those subtleties 
  as to power and perspective which have also been discussed by Foucault. </p>
<p>The most popular questions in Section A were Q3 (on the relation between the 
  visual and the linguistic), Q4 (on visuality and the body), Q8 (on the Gaze), 
  Q14 (on photography and composition); and in section B, Q16 (on wonder), Q20 
  (on the traveler&#8217;s imagination), and Q23 (on the tour&#8217;s capacity 
  to disturb).</p>
<p>All the work showed evidence of good preparation; much of it was wide-ranging, 
  visually literate, and varied. In Section A, a number of candidates had thought 
  hard about representation, the Gaze, new kinds of observation, feminist approaches, 
  photography, and illustration. A few candidates wrote outstandingly well on 
  contemporary painting and on photography. In Section B, several candidates gave 
  shrewd but at times routinized accounts of the vicissitudes of the Tour; a few 
  tackled issues of imperialism and orientalism, travel writing, the resistance 
  of ruins to imaginative colonization, architecture (Soane), or collecting. It 
  must be said that a narrow selection of authorities on both the Tour and travel 
  writing tended to be overworked, in some cases at the expense of more independent

<p><strong>Paper 12c: Contemporary Writing in English: 1979 to the present</strong><br />
  24 candidates <br />
  1st: 7; 2:1: 11; 2:2: 5; 3rd: 1 </p>
<p>This paper is not a period paper, but many candidates still approach it as 
  if it were. Soundbite gobbets about postmodernism are not analytic or explanatory 
  tools, and often are no more than obfuscatory. A few candidates had read and 
  absorbed works by Jameson and Linda Hutcheon, and made intelligent use of their 
  arguments, but there was too much readiness to settle for unhelpful, low-level 
  generalisations and parallel these with brief accounts of over-familiar novels 
  such as Midnight&#8217;s Children, Enduring Love or Beloved. This is a paper 
  that rewards wide, deep, exploratory reading and independent judgement. The 
  best scripts showed genuine interest in the writers they discussed, and a willingness 
  to make connections and comparisons among them. </p>
<p><br />
  There was disappointingly little writing on poetry, and little on drama or performance 
  writing. Avant-garde writing, or even the notion of an avant-garde, did not 
  feature, nor was there much sense of the density and conflicted state of contemporary 
  cultures. There was little passion and little risk. On the other hand, there 
  was some excellent work in the upper range of marks on a variety of writers, 
  showing evidence of imaginative engagement, insight and serious thinking. </p>
<p><strong>Dissertations</strong><br />
  The statistics show that candidates were notably less successful in achieving 
  a First Class mark for their optional dissertations. This unsurprisingly suggests 
  that those students who submit two dissertations may find it difficult to devote 
  an equal proportion of time, ingenuity and energy to them. As usual many students 
  did their best work on at least one dissertation. The best ones were careful, 
  wide-ranging and at times imaginative, sophisticated, and well-written. Some 
  chose to produce a well-researched erudite account of their topic while others 
  used it as the opportunity for critical, speculative or theoretical work. The 
  diversity of authors and topics and kinds of work was impressive. The best showed 
  evidence of wide reading around the subject, and managed a good balance between 
  evidence of learning and close critical work which was used to direct and support 
  a clear argument. Those which used secondary material well tended to engage 
  with the critics they quoted &#8211;&#8211; challenging or qualifying their 
  points rather than just reproducing them. Those who were content with description 
  at the expense of analysis and evaluation fared less well. Some very good work 
  talked intelligently about context and the relationship between texts. Only 
  a few dissertations stood out as having been completed in haste or with insufficient 
  material or thought. Weak dissertations tended to reveal themselves early on 
  in aimless or misleading synopses. This suggests that students should not leave 
  their abstract until the last minute, but use writing (and rewriting) it as 
  a tool for checking that their argument is clear and consistent. A small number 
  of dissertations flouted the regulations governing synopsis, footnotes, bibliography 
  and word-count, and were penalized accordingly. <br />
