\par \pard \ltrpar\qj \li0 \fi0 \ri0 \sl480 \sb0 \sa0 \plain \b \f1 \fs20 \cf9 \tab Court en banc holds:
\plain \f1 \fs20 \cf9  This Court reviews the Board's decision, and the interpretation of an ordinance is a question of law. By authorizing uses with "similar" as well as the "same" characteristics of listed uses, subsection H of section 400.370 permits an unlisted use with characteristics that are not identical to those of a listed use. Under-$500 lending services, short-term consumer loans and under-$500 lenders are similar to permitted uses such as personal services and financial institutions, banks, savings and loan associations, and credit unions. Sunshine is not a pawnshop or a check-cashing business and, under section 400.370, it can operate in a general commercial district. Additionally, where a city ordinance prohibits a business that state law permits, the city must show the ordinance does not conflict with state law. State law authorizes under-$500 lenders, but the city has not shown that ordinance 2074, which prohibits short-term lending in all its zoning districts, is a valid exercise of its zoning power.

\plain \f1 \fs20 \cf0 When Sunshine lends money, it accepts a check for the amount of the loan and fees, post-dated to the due date.  Fees increase with the amount of the loan.  At the due date, the customer can pay cash for the loan and fees, let Sunshine cash the check, or "buy" an extension.  If Sunshine cashes the check and it is not honored, Sunshine pursues remedies against the customer, the

\plain \f1 \fs20 \cf0  of the check.
\par \pard \ltrpar\qj \li0 \fi720 \ri0 \sl480 \sb0 \sa0 \plain \f1 \fs20 \cf0 According to the record, check-cashing businesses are not licensed by the state.  Check-cashing businesses charge customers a fee to cash a check, typically issued by a third party.  The fee increases with the likelihood of dishonor.  If the check is dishonored, the check-cashing business's recourse is primarily against the third party, the

\plain \f1 \fs20 \cf0 , 569 S.W.2d 740, 743 (Mo. banc 1978).  The city meets this burden by showing that its regulation is a valid exercise of the zoning power, that the state-authorized business is not an appropriate use within the city.  See, e.g., 
\plain \i \f1 \fs20 \cf0 McDermott v. Village of Calverton Park
\plain \f1 \fs20 \cf0 , 454 S.W.2d 577, 581-84 (Mo. banc 1970).  In this case, the city has not shown that Ordinance 2074 is a valid exercise of the zoning power.
