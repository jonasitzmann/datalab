So taut were his nerves that he leaped as though stung whenMajor nuzzled a cool nose into his hand again. Automatically, he beganto stroke the dogs neck. Well, that licks us, he muttered. There isnt another piece ofmovable metal in the world. Major kept whimpering and pushing against him. Annoyed, the druggistshoved him away. Go way, he muttered. I dont feel like Suddenly then his eyes widened, as his touch encountered warm metal. Hewhirled. There it is he yelled. The last link. The nameplate on Majorscollar In a flash, he had torn the little rectangular brass plate from the dogcollar. Erickson took it from his grasp. Sweat stood shiny on his skin. He held the bit of metal over the gap between wire and pole. This is it he smiled brittlely. Were on our way, Dave. Where, Idont know. To death, or back to life. Butwere going The metal clinked into place. Live, wri thing power leaped through thewire, snarling across partial breaks. The transformers began to hum. Thehumming grew louder. {\*\htmltag0 </Span>}\htmlrtf

\cbpat2\plain\f0{\f2\cf2\fs10\htmlrtf0 Singing softly, the bronze globe over their headsglowed green. Dave Miller felt a curious lightness. There was a snap inhis brain, and Erickson, Major and the laboratory faded from his senses. Then came an interval when the only sound was the soft sobbing he hadbeen hearing as if in a dream. That, and blackness that enfolded himlike soft velvet. Then Miller was opening his eyes, to see the familiarwalls of his own kitchen around him Someone cried out. Dave Oh, Dave, dear It was Helens voice, and it was Helen who cradled his head in her lapand bent her face close to his. Oh, thank God that youre alive Helen Miller murmured. Whatareyoudoing here? I couldnt go through with it. II just couldnt leave you. I cameback andand I heard the shot and ran in. The doctor should be here. Icalled him five minutes ago. Five minutes . .. How long has it been since I shot m yself? Oh, just six or seven minutes. I called the doctor right away. Miller took a deep breath. Then it must have been a dream. Allthatto happen in a few minutes It wasnt possible Howhow could I have botched the job? he muttered. I wasnt drunkenough to miss myself completely. Helen looked at the huge revolver lying in the sink. Oh, that old fortyfive of Grandfathers It hasnt been loaded sincethe Civil War. I guess the powder got damp or something. It just sort ofsputtered instead of exploding properly.Dave, promise me somethingYou t ever do anything like this again, if I promise not to nagyou? Dave Miller closed his eyes. There t be any need to nag, Helen. Some people take a lot of teaching, but Ive had my lesson. Ive gotideas about the store which Id been too lazy to try out. You know, Ifeel more like fighting right now than I have for years Well lick em, t we, honey? Helen buried her face in the hollow of his shoulder and cried softly. Her words were too muffled to be intelligibl e. But Dave Millerunderstood what she meant. He had thought the whole thing a dreamJohn Erickson, the timeimpulsor and Major. But that night he read an item in the EveningCourier that was to keep him thinking for many days. POLICE INVESTIGATE DEATH OF SCIENTIST HERE IN LABORATORY John M. Erickson, director of the Wanamaker Institute, died at his work last night. Erickson was a beloved and valuable figure in the world of science, famous for his recently publicized time lapse theory. Two strange circumstances surrounded his death. One was the presence of a German shepherd dog in the laboratory, its head crushed as if with a sledgehammer. The other was a chain of small metal objects stretching from one corner of the room to the other, as if intended to take the place of wire in a circuit. Police, however, discount this idea, as there was a roll of wire only a few feet from the body. THE END FOOTNOTES: 1 Obviously this electric time impulsor is a machine in the nature ofan atomic integr ator. It broadcasts great waves of electrons whichalign all atomic objects in rigid suspension. That is to say, atomic structures are literally frozen. Living bodiesare similarly affected. It is a widely held belief on the part of manyeminent scientists that all matter, broken down into its elementaryatomic composition, is electrical in structure. That being so, there is no reason to suppose why Professor Erickson maynot have discovered a time impulsor which, broadcasting electronicimpulses, froze everything within its range. ED.
