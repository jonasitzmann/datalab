\b0\fs24 \cf0 Password Wallet\'99 is a convenient and secure place to store all of your usernames and passwords.  For security, PasswordWallet\'99 uses 448-bit BlowFish encryption to protect your data.  For convenience, PasswordWallet\'99 can save URLs with your passwords and launch your default browser for you.  For safety, PasswordWallet\'99 can copy your password to the clipboard and clear it automatically after you paste.  One "master" password unlocks all of your other passwords.  PasswordWallet\'99 will add your "master" password to the Keychain control panel!  It just doesn't get any easier than this.\
\
Users can add as many usernames and passwords as they like.  We securely synchronize your PasswordWallet\'99 with your Palm OS Device, so you can have your passwords, and a little piece of mind, while you're away from your computer! \
\
Enjoy!\

\b0\fs24 \cf0 * Fixed an issue where PasswordWallet would always attempt to store the master password in the Mac OS X keychain.  If you don't want your password stored in the Mac OS X keychain, change your password and un-check the keychain box.  Then save your file.\
* Auto-typing delays (not pause-resumes) are now working differently.  Each delay character will toggle the delay state of auto-typing.  The default is fast typing.  If the character is delayed, auto-typing will be slowed through completion, or until the next delay character makes it fast again.\
* Added logic to make sure we're reading a PW4 file when the suffix or type/creator says it's a PW4 file.\
* Added warning in conduit installer for "Macintosh overwrites Handheld" setting.\
* Fixed problem where browser setting in some records was not imported from v3 properly on Intel.  PW4 now handles all custom browser records correctly.\
* PasswordWallet will no longer quit while syncing a file even if the "Quit after last window closed" preference is on.\
* Added tool-tip to file selectors so long paths can be viewed more easily.\
* Fixed problem where "Last Access Date" change would trigger a record duplication during a sync.\
* Within the AutoTyping special character menus, the actual special character glyph was added for reference.\
* [Conduit] Fixed issues with PowerPC Conduit in HotSync Manager.\
* [Conduit & App] Fixed issues with all "Reveal in Finder" buttons.\
