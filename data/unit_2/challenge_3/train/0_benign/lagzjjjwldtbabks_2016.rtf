There is a considerable lack of both clarity and consistent usage in the terms that are used to refer to the conferral by States of sovereign powers on international organizations. Such terms as \lquote ceding\rquote , \lquote alienation\rquote , \lquote 
transfer\rquote , \lquote delegation\rquote , and \lquote authorization\rquote 
 are used interchangeably by international and domestic courts as well as by commentators often to refer to the same conferral of power or the same term is used in a general way to refer to different types of conferrals. How
ever not all conferrals of power are the same, and there are important differences that flow from the type of conferral for the legal relationship established between a State conferring power and an organization. The failure to distinguish between the dif
f
erent types of conferrals of power undermines analysis of the differing legal consequences of these conferrals as well as obscuring the domestic policy debates that surround the conferral of powers. It is for these reasons that this paper introduces a typ
o
logy of the terms that can be used to describe conferrals by States of powers on international organizations; and then goes on to consider the first category in the proposed typology, an agency relationship that may flow from the conferral by States of po
wers on an organization.}{\b\fs24

\par \tab A characteristic of the development of international organizations in the last half Century has been the shift in the locus of decision-making on a whole range of governance issues from national governments to int
ernational organizations. This process was not at first a major focus of attention, since organizations were initially cautious in the exercise of their limited powers and when organizations did make decisions that potentially bound Member States there wa
s a primary role given to State consent in the acceptance of such obligations. However this institutional landscape is evolving. International organizations have increasingly themselves interpreted their powers \endash  even of binding decision \endash 
 in an expansive manner that blurs the role of State consent,}{\cs16\fs24\super \chftn {\footnote \pard\plain \s15\qj \fi720\li0\ri230\widctlpar\aspalpha\aspnum\faauto\adjustright\rin230\lin0\itap0 \fs20\lang2057\langfe2057\cgrid\langnp2057\langfenp2057 {

 and States have increasingly conferred broader public powers of governance on international organizations.
\par \tab The broad range of measures being taken by international organizations in the exercise of conferred powers has provoked a considerable response from a variety of domestic
 political and judicial actors and commentators alike in terms of questioning the }{\i\fs24 vires}{\fs24  of such action, but also, more generally, in terms of questioning }{\fs24\expnd0\expndtw-2 
both the propriety of conferring broad powers of governance on organizations as well as }{\fs24 questioning }{\fs24\expnd0\expndtw-2 th
eir States continued participation in the work of organizations of which they are already Members. There is, however, a considerable lack of clarity in the discourse on these issues. The terms used to describe particular conferrals are often used intercha
ngeably to refer to the same type of conferral of power or the same term is used in a general way to refer to different types of conferrals. }{\fs24 
However not all conferrals of power are the same, and there are important differences that flow from the type of con
ferral for the legal relationship that is thereby established between a State conferring power and an organization. The failure to distinguish between the different types of conferrals of power undermines analysis of the differing legal consequences of th
ese conferrals as well as obscuring the domestic policy debates that surround the conferral of powers. To consider all of these issues is, due to considerations of brevity, beyond the scope of this present paper.}{\cs16\fs24\super \chftn {\footnote

 provides for such a conferral. It is generally accepted that a State can impose a legally binding obligation on itself to carry out a particular act by making a unilateral declaration. (See }{\i\fs18 Legal Status of Eastern Greenland, PCIJ, }{\fs18

 Due, however, to the importance attached by States to the conferral of powers on international organizations, it is difficult to find examples of conferrals by means of the relatively informal and unclear process of making a unilateral declaration. Even 
w
here, however, a State does purport to confer powers on an organization by unilateral declaration, the conferral only becomes legally effective once it has been accepted by the organization in question. (On the necessity for such acceptance and on the met

 wherein the States Parties undertake as a matter of binding obligation to confer powers on the organization. This obligation does not mean, however, that a State will necessarily be bound by the organization\rquote

 The constituent treaty may as such provide for the conferral of discrete sovereign powers on an organization, but the actual conferral of power only takes place once a State has ratified the treaty.
\par \tab A technical objection that has been made to the constituent treaty being a means for the conferral of power is that it is not the Member States }{\i\fs24 per se}{\fs24  who confer powers on the organization but the constituent tre

\par \tab This approach is, however, overly formalistic. It is true that UN Member States cannot themselves confer powers on, }{\i\fs24 in casu}{\fs24 , th

But the constituent instruments of international organizations are also treaties of a particular type; their object is to create new subjects of law endowed with a certain autonomy

 interpret these constituent treaties.\rquote  (}{\i\fs18 Legality of the Threat or Use of Nuclear Weapons, ICJ Advisory Opinion}{\fs18 , (1996), para.19.)}}}{\fs24 
 This complexity does not, to reiterate, prevent the constituent treaty from being characterized as a mechanism for the c
onferral of powers, but it does mean that international organizations and their constituent treaties cannot be analysed in a comprehensive fashion by focusing only on the conferral by States of express powers on organizations. Two examples suffice to illu

\par \tab In addition to the conferral of express powers by means of a constituent treaty, States may also purport to confer powers on an organiz

s
sary since a treaty purporting to confer powers may in substance represent nothing more than either a request to the organization to exercise its power in a particular situation or the proffering of consent by the State in cases where such consent is nece
ssary for the organization to be able to exercise an express or implied power that it already possesses. The second issue is to determine whether the organization has the competence to exercise the powers being conferred by contractual treaty.

 The legally binding nature of these acts or declarations is akin to that of a unilateral act or declaration by a State under international law, which, if it was the State\rquote 
s intention, may impose a legally binding obligation on the State. The reason why such unilateral declarations may bind a State applies equally to the case of an international organization. In the context of a State, the International Court in the }{
\i\fs18 Nuclear Tests}{\fs18  cases held: \lquote One of the basic principles governing the creation and performance of legal obligations, whatever their source, is the principle of good faith. \'85 Just as the very rule of }{\i\fs18 pacta sunt servanda}{
\fs18  in the law of treati
es is based on good faith, so also is the binding character of an international obligation assumed by unilateral declaration. Thus interested States may take cognisance of unilateral declarations and place confidence in them, and are entitled to require t
hat the obligation thus created be respected.\rquote  (}{\i\fs18 Nuclear Tests (New Zealand v. France), ICJ Reports}{\fs18 
 (1974), p.268.) There is no reason why an international organization - which like a State possesses international legal personality and the competence to acce
pt binding obligations under international law - should not similarly be bound by such unilateral declarations. This approach of treating an international organization in an analogous manner to a State when acting to accept binding obligations under inter
national law is reflected in the 1986 Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties between States and International Organizations or between International Organizations which \lquote generally assimilates international organizations to States\rquote 
 for the purposes of determining when an international organization has expressed its consent to be bound by an international agreement. (Gaja, }{\i\fs18 supra}{\fs18  n.12, p.258)}}}{\fs24 
 may be more appropriate. In any case, however, it is not the form that is decisive, but rather the indication of a clear intention by the organ concerned that it has accepted the conferral of power.}{\cs16\fs24\super \chftn {\footnote \pard\plain

ver, even where an organization may seem to have accepted a purported conferral of power, this does not mean that a substantive conferral will always have taken place. The reason for this is that the powers the States are purporting to confer may already

\fs18  In the case where a State conferring powers is a non-Member, there is an important policy issue from an organization\rquote s perspective that would seem to militate against such States being able to confer powers on an organizati

 The determination as to whether this is the case will largely depend on the reaction of the organ on whom powers are purportedly being conferred. For example, an organ may make it clear in responding to a conferral that it is being given a
 power that it did not otherwise possess under its constituent treaty. This determination by an organ of the scope of its powers will, in the absence of review by a body which has jurisdiction to decide such a matter, certainly prevail over the interpreta

Article 1 of Annex 1-A stipulates that the objectives of the Peace Agreement are to establish a durable cessation of hostilities; provide for the \lquote

 (}{\fs18 S/PV.3607, p.25.}{\fs18\expnd0\expndtw-1

pecified in the Agreement. This is, however, a clear misconception of the legal position. The Security Council possesses under Article 42 of the Charter a power to order military enforcement to be taken against a State or an entity within a State; obvious
ly without the need for the consent of those who are to be subject to such action. In the case of the Dayton Agreement, it was clear that once the Security Council had adopted resolution 1031 \lquote acting under Chapter VII of the Charter\rquote 
 that the Council considered that it was exercising its own powers and not a power conferred by the States parties to the Agreement. As such, the Council was not constrained \lquote to do only what the Bosnian sides agreed to\rquote 
, since the authority of the Council did not derive from the 
Agreement but from its own powers under Chapter VII of the Charter which in the area of military enforcement action does not require the consent of the target State. Accordingly, the inclusion of the reference in resolution 1031 to the \lquote 
parties have consented to IFOR\rquote s taking such measures\rquote  was for political not legal reasons. Put differently, the mention of State consent in the resolution was of no legal consequence.

 The express reference by the Council to its Chapter VII powers is important, since it means that the Council is exercising governmental powers over parts of Croatian territory using its Charter powers, and not as a consequence of governm
ental powers being conferred on it by the Republic of Croatia - the only party to the agreement which was a State. This characterisation of the legal basis for the exercise of powers was to prove controversial but important when determining whether it was
 Croatia or the UN Security Council who had the power to terminate the activities being carried out by the UN Transitional Administration.
\par \tab Following the successful holding of elections in the region by UNTAES, the UN Transitional Administrator developed a two-phase \lquote exit strategy\rquote  which was described by the UN Secretary-General in the following terms: \lquote 
In the first phase, the Transitional Adm
inistrator would devolve to Croatia executive responsibility for the major part of civil administration of the region while maintaining his authority and ability to intervene and overrule decisions should the situation deteriorate and the achievements of 
UNTAES be threatened. The pace of devolution would be commensurate with Croatia\rquote 
s demonstrated ability to reassure the Serb population and successfully complete peaceful reintegration. In the second phase, and subject to satisfactory Croatian performance, r
emaining executive functions would be devolved, with Croatia assuming responsibility for the continued demilitarisation of the region and the gradual integration of the Transitional Police Force into the Croatian police force.\rquote }{\cs16\fs24\super

 This position was endorsed in express terms by the Security Council in resolution 1120. The Council, moreover, decided in resolution 1120 to extend the mandate of UNTAES for a further six months until 
15 January 1998. This resolution was adopted despite the strong objections of Croatia who argued that UNTAES should at this time be immediately terminated and that powers of government be resumed immediately by Croatia. The fact of its adoption by the Sec
urity Council reiterated that the establishment and operation of UNTAES was an exercise by the Council of its own Chapter VII powers and not pursuant to the exercise of powers conferred by Croatia on an }{\i\fs24 ad hoc}{\fs24 
 basis. This control by the Council was further reiterated when it decided in resolution 1145 of 15 January 1998 to terminate UNTAES, the Council alone having decided that UNTAES had now fulfilled its mandate.}{\cs16\fs24\super \chftn {\footnote

 Similar issues arise concerning the role that State consent plays in the establishment and utilization by the Security Council of UN peace-keeping forces. The establi
shment and utilization of such forces by the UN Security Council represents the exercise by the Council of an implied power under Chapter VII of the Charter (Sarooshi, D., \lquote 
The Role of the United Nations Secretary-General in United Nations Peace-Keeping Operations\rquote , 20 }{\i\fs18 Australian Yearbook of International Law}{\fs18  (1999), p.279 at pp.280-282). However, the ICJ in the }{\i\fs18 Expenses}{\fs18 
 case held that UN peace-keeping operations are not military enforcement \'93action\'94 within the terms of Chapter VII. The }{\fs18\expnd0\expndtw-3 consequence of this 
being that the deployment and utilization of a UN peace-keeping force is conditional on the consent of both the States contributing troops to the force and the host State where the force is to be deployed. (}{\i\fs18 Expenses case, ICJ Reports}{\fs18 
 (1962), p.165. See also on consent the report of the SG, A/3302, contained in Higgins, R., }{\i\fs18 United Nations Peacekeeping 1946-1967}{\fs18  (vol.1, 1969) at p.263; Garvey, J., \'93United Nations Peacekeeping and Host State Consent\'94 (1970) 64 }{

\fs18\expnd0\expndtw-3 ) It is important, however, not to confuse this consent requirement of States to contribute troops t
o a UN peace-keeping force (as contained in a Status of Forces Agreement) and of States to have the force stationed on their territory as being a conferral of power on the UN such that the States concerned can seek to control or specify limits on the use 
by the Council of its implied powers once their consent has been given. Cf. those cases where States have tried to exercise such control in the case of UN peace-keeping, see Sarooshi, }{\i\fs18\expnd0\expndtw-3 ibidem}{\fs18\expnd0\expndtw-3 
, pp.288, 290-291, 295.)}}}{\fs24  but it should not, in general terms, be c
haracterized as a substantive conferral of power. In the example examined above, however, even this consent was not needed, since the UN Security Council does not require the consent of States to exercise its Chapter VII powers. As such, the agreement rep
resented no more than a request to the Council to exercise its Chapter VII powers.

There is, however, an important exception to the general position that a substantive conferral of powers only takes place when the powers purporting to be conferred are thos
e which the organization does not possess under its constituent treaty. This exception is where the organ of an organization, although possessing the powers being conferred, chooses instead to take up the conferral using a general competence to do so rath
e
r than treating the purported conferral as an invitation to use its existing powers under the constituent treaty. This choice is not simply a matter of semantics. It has the important practical consequence that the States conferring powers may impose cons
t
raints on the exercise of powers by the organization. A good example of this is provided by the practice of the UN Security Council where it has chosen to accept a conferral of powers that would seem to fall within the scope of its powers under Chapter VI
I thereby constraining itself to exercise the power subject to the terms and conditions of the particular conferral.

supervision over other agencies that could influence the outcome of elections; and the right to investigate various other government organs to determine whether they were undermining the accords and, if so, to take corrective measures. This authority was

 may have the effect of modifying the treaty. \'85
 Although the line may sometimes be blurred between interpretation and amendment of a treaty through subsequent practice, legally the processes are distinct. Accordingly, the effect of subsequent practice in am
ending a treaty is dealt with in the present article as a case of modification of treaties.\rquote  (}{\i\fs18 Yearbook of the International Law Commission}{\fs18 , 1966, Vol.II, p.236. The Commission continued in its Commentary to state: \lquote 
In formulating the rule in this way the C
ommission intended to indicate that the subsequent practice, even if every party might not itself have actively participated in the practice, must be such as to establish the agreement of the parties as a whole to the modification in question.\rquote  (}{
\i\fs18 Yearbook of the International Law Commission}{\fs18 
, 1966, Vol.II, p.236.)) This provision proved controversial at the Vienna Conference and it was deleted from the draft articles of the Convention by a vote of 53 to 15, with 26 abstentions. This deletion is arguably, howe
ver, of little juridical consequence. Akehurst provides the correct interpretation of this fact when he states: \lquote \'85
 only 10 of the 26 States which spoke in favour of the proposal to delete said that Article 38 was not in accordance with existing law; 3 Stat
es supported deletion because they thought that it was inappropriate for the Convention to deal with relations between treaties and customary law; 11 States said that the rule laid down in Article 38 was undesirable, but did not say whether or not it was 
i
n accordance with existing law; the remaining 2 of the 26 States advocated deletion without giving reasons. It is thus difficult to interpret the deletion of Article 38 as a clear rejection of the view that existing law allowed a treaty to be amended by s
u
bsequent practice, especially since the Vienna Convention did not exclude the possibility of termination of treaties by desuetude, and expressly allowed a treaty to be interpreted in the light of subsequent practice (Article 3(3)(b)); amendment merges int
o termination at one extreme and into interpretation at the other extreme. \'85 Subsequent practice often modifies the constituent treaties of international organizations. (Akehurst, M., \lquote The Hierarchy of the Sources of International Law\rquote , }
{\i\fs18 British Year Book of International Law}{\fs18 
, 47 (1974-5), p.275 at p.277.) Cf., however, the strong opposition to the operation of subsequent practice as a means of modifying a constituent treaty by Judge Spender in the Expenses case when in his separate opinion he stated: \lquote The Ch
arter establishes an Organization. The Organization must function through its constituted organs. The functions and authorities of those organs are set out in the Charter. However the Charter is otherwise described the essential fact is that it is a multi

 amendment deserves more detailed consideration, since it may provide an important legal basis for an organization being able to accept and utilize a

ather a recognition by the other members of the Security Council at the relevant moment, and indeed by all member States by tacit acceptance, of the validity of such resolutions. \'85
 One way of looking at the matter is to regard the Charter as having been in effect amended by the subsequent practice of the parties to it. Fitzmaurice himself in his series of articles referred specifically to the abstention question as an example of a 
\lquote common principle on the part of parties to a treaty\rquote  which \lquote may constitute a means whereby the strict effect of the treaty can be modified\rquote , or of \lquote an amendment to the treaty by a tacit unwritten consensus.\rquote

The interesting part of this pronouncement is that it did not go so far as to identify definitively how the practice was given legal effect. On one view it is tantamount to a modification o
r amendment or the Charter. Certainly the Court was at pains to emphasise evidence suggesting the universal acceptance of the practice, so that the \lquote consent\rquote 
 of the parties could be said to have existed. For those who regarded Article 27.3 as having a clear meaning which required a concurring vote of }{\i\fs18 all}{\fs18  permanent members, the practice of UN members must be taken to have constituted a }{
\i\fs18 de facto}{\fs18  revision of the Charter the }{\i\fs18 de jure}{\fs18  effect of which the Court has now recognised.\rquote  (Greig, D., \lquote The interpretation of treaties and Article IV.2 of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty\rquote , }{

Central to the notion of acquiescence under international law is that a State has knowledge of the specific act whose failure to protest against may lead to the change in its legal rights or duties. Put differently, a St
ate cannot be said to have acquiesced in a decision or action if it was not in the first place aware of the decision or action that was purporting to change its legal rights or duties. This does not mean, however, that a State must necessarily be aware of
 
the legal implications of its failure to protest in a particular case: this is a matter for each State to ascertain for itself as a matter of self-interest. The knowledge threshold for acquiescence to be able to take place is more factual in nature: was t
h
e State aware, or should have been aware, of the particular act, or, in our case, decision of the international organization purporting to accept a conferral of power. In the case of international organizations, this issue of sufficient knowledge may be a
n
 issue of real concern to a number of smaller States who due to limited resources cannot monitor, let alone analyze, decisions of a number of international organizations to which they are a party. It is precisely in such cases that repeated instances of p
r
actice by an organization may be necessary to evidence that Member States of an organization had knowledge of the particular decision (set of decisions) that purports to change their legal rights or duties. This issue of knowledge in the case of Member St
ates of an international organization will of course depend on the type, and thus membership, of the organ that is taking the decision to accept an }{\i\fs24 ad hoc}{\fs24 
 conferral of powers. If, for example, it is a plenary organ taking the decision, then there is a stron
g presumption that a Member State had knowledge of, and could thus have protested against, the decision. If, however, it is a non-plenary organ then it may depend on other factors such as whether the secretariat of the organization notified all Member Sta
tes of the proposed \endash  and taken \endash  decision. This largely factual matter will depend accordingly on the specifics of the particular organization.
\par \tab The second precondition for the operation of acquiescence is that a State must have an appropriate forum to express its protest against a purported change in its rights or duties \endash  in our case the }{\i\fs24 de facto}{\fs24 
 modification of the constituent treaty. Difficulties concerning this precondition do not usually arise in the case of acquiescence outside the context of interna
tional organizations, since a State can of course protest directly to the other State whose actions are purporting to change its legal rights or duties. Where, however, the contested decision is that of an organ of an international organization then direc
t
 protest to other States will be of no legal consequence: what is necessary is that States have the facility to object to the decision within the confines of the organization. This precondition is nonetheless satisfied in the case of international organiz
a

 There is a healthy practice of member States of organizations objecting to decisions of, for example, the plenary organ of the organization when casting their vote on

Essays on Bentham: Jurisprudence and Political Theory}{\fs18  (2000), p.2.)}}}{\fs24  It is for these reasons that this section provides a typology of the terms that can be used to describe conferrals by States of powers on international organizations.

\par \tab In order to provide this typology it may be useful to consider these conferrals of powe
r as being on a spectrum that has at one end a conferral that establishes an agency relationship between the State and the organization and at the other extremity a conferral that involves the ceding of power to the organization. In between these two posi
t
ions lies the category of a delegation of power that is closer to the agency position on the spectrum and the separate category of a transfer of power that is closer to a ceding of power. The locus of a particular conferral of power on this spectrum depen
d
s on the degree to which a State has given away the power to the organization. There are three indicia, or characteristics, of a conferral that can be used to ascertain the degree to which a power has been given away by a State, and thus within which of o
u
r categories a particular conferral of power can be placed. First is the question of revocability. To what extent, if at all, is the conferral of powers revocable by the State? The second is the degree to which a State has retained control over the exerci
s
e of power by the organization. Finally, does the organization possess the sole right to exercise the power being conferred on it by a State or has the State retained the right to exercise the power concurrently with the organization? Accordingly, the deg
ree to which a power has been given away to an organization does not depend on the nature of a particular power \endash 
 whether it is, for example, a legislative, executive, or judicial power or even whether the power is discretionary or non-discretionary in nature.
\par \tab 
The classification of all conferrals of power within one of our categories cannot, however, be precise since the boundaries between these categories are not definitively fixed and there may be cases that contain elements common to two categories that 
are adjacent on our spectrum. These categories do provide, however, a useful analytical tool since moving along the spectrum there are positions which produce differing legal consequences and thus the classification of a particular conferral of power as m
a
inly being at one of these positions, within one of our categories, helps clarify the legal consequences that result from the type of conferral of power. These legal consequences include the following: In whose interest is the power being primarily exerci
sed: the State\rquote s or the organization\rquote s? Put differently, is the organization exercising the power in its own right or on behalf of the State? Whose legal relations are changed as a consequence of the exercise of the power: the State\rquote 
s or the organization\rquote s?
 In the case where the State has retained the right to exercise the power being conferred on an organization, whose interpretation of the power will prevail in the case of a conflict that arises from the concurrent exercise of the power? And, finally, who
 is responsible for breaches of international law that may occur as a result of the organization\rquote s exercise of the conferred power: the State or the organization or both?
\par \tab The starting point on our spectrum - and the first category in our typology - are tho
se conferrals that establish an agency relationship between the State and the organization. Due to considerations of length this is the only category to be discussed in this present work.}{\cs16\fs24\super \chftn {\footnote \pard\plain

three preconditions to be fulfilled before an agency relationship can be said to exist between legal entities. The first is that the purported principal and agent must be separate legal entities. The second is a consent requirement: that a purported princ

 This scenario was discussed, but dismissed, in the International Tin Council [ITC] litigation in the English courts. For example, Justice Millet stated: \lquote 
The ITC was able to enter into the contracts in question, incur liabilities and suffer the arbitration award against it because paragraph 5 of the Order of 1972 provides that it shall have the legal capacities o

 directly against them. If, on the other hand, the ITC has a sufficient legal personality of its own, distinct from that of its members, not merely in international law but in English domestic law also, then the contracts in question were entered into by

 There are similarities between the international law concept of agency and its domestic law counterpart, but agency in international law cannot solely be equated with, or constructed by analogy from, its domestic counterpart for two main reasons.
\par }\pard \qj \li0\ri230\widctlpar\aspalpha\aspnum\faauto\adjustright\rin230\lin0\itap0 {\fs18 \tab 
First, the domestic law of agency is in the main concerned with the conferral of private law power; while in the context of international organizations it is a public law power being conferred by a State on an organization. This limitation of t
he use of private law analogies has also been recognised by some domestic public law systems. For example, in the English Courts it was held in the case of }{\i\fs18 Town Investments Ltd. v. Environment Secretary}{\fs18  that the relationship between 
\lquote the Crown\rquote  and \lquote Ministers of the Crown\rquote  had to be analysed in public law terms and not by using private law concepts of agency and trust. (}{\i\fs18 Town Investments Ltd. v. Environment Secretary}{\fs18 , [1978] AC 359.)

\par \tab Second, the domestic law of agency is largely directed at allocating, or r
ather balancing, commercial risk between business actors and thus its transplantation to public international law which concerns relations between sovereign States is problematic. (I am grateful to Professor James Crawford for this point.)
\par \tab These problems 
do not, however, prohibit in general terms recourse to the domestic law of agency, but they do mean that the concept as it appears in public international law may differ in content. For example, the notion of an undisclosed principal in the domestic law o
f agency has no application in the context of public international law, since, as Chinkin states, \lquote 
any such claim should be dismissed as contrary to the principle of openness in international relations, and the right of States to select their treaty partners.\rquote  (Chinkin, }{\i\fs18 supra}{\fs18  n.14, p.66.) Moreover, Sereni states \lquote 
Since international agency is intended to function with relation to third parties, it is necessary that they be informed of the extent of the authority conferred upon the agent. No special form is p
rovided as to the way in which an agency relationship is to be made known to the third parties. \'85
 Every international transaction is so closely connected with the special characteristics and qualities of each subject involved that each of them must necessa
rily know the other parties to whom rights and duties are to be assumed. There is no place in international law for the doctrine of the undisclosed principal.\rquote  (Sereni, }{\i\fs18 supra}{\fs18 
 n.11, p.649.) Cf. also the caution espoused in this context by Shabtai Rosenne: }{\i\fs18 Yearbook of the International Law Commission}{\fs18 , vol.1, (1964), p.55 at para.26.}}}{\fs24 
 In domestic legal systems, the operation of the law may remove the need for the consent of the principal to the establishment of certain agency relationships.}{\cs16\fs22\super \chftn {\footnote \pard\plain

 this relationship [of agency in international law] must necessarily be based on an agreement between principal and agent. The consent of both parties is indispensable: without the principal's consent the agent has no authority, withou
t the agent's consent the principal is unrepresented. Some domestic law systems have established, besides consensual agency, several types of agency immediately derived from law, independent of the consent of the parties or at least of the principal. Thes
e types of agency }{\i\fs18 ex lege}{\fs18  have been provided in order to allow certain individuals without the natural or legal capacity of acting, to enter into legal relations: }{\i\fs18 e.g.}{\fs18 
 the father's agency for the minor child or the guardian's for the insane. In internationa
l law there is no need for these types of so-called legal agency. By the mere fact of existence, every subject of international law is privileged to participate in international transactions in person, through its own organs. The principle is assumed that
 every international subject has the capacity to enter directly into international intercourse.\rquote  (Sereni, }{\i\fs18 supra}{\fs18  n.11, p.645.)
\par Also in domestic law, however, it is generally the case that both the agent and the principal must consent to the establishment of the agency relationship. See Reuschlein, H., and Gregory, W., }{\i\fs18 The Law of Agency and Partnership}{\fs18 , (2}{

 However, international law by contrast does not presume the acceptance by States of obligations without their consent. This has the consequence that agency involving a Stat
e must be consent based, since otherwise international law will not recognize the capacity of the agent to incur obligations on behalf of its principal (the State).}{\cs16\fs24\super \chftn {\footnote \pard\plain

\par Brownlie, moreover, emphasises the importance of state consent by way of agreement to a situation of agency when he states: \lquote 
States may act on behalf of other states for various purposes, provided that authority to do so exists and is not exceeded. States may appoint other states as agents for various purposes, including the mak
ing of treaties. This agency may arise from the existence of a relation of federation or dependence or protection or other wise. By agreement an organization may become an agent for member states, and others, in regard to matters outside its normal compet
ence and a state may act as agent for an organization.\rquote  (Brownlie, I., }{\i\fs18 Principles of Public International Law}{\fs18 , (1990, 4}{\fs18\super th}{\fs18  ed.), p.678.)
\par Cheng states the more general point after reviewing relevant case-law: \lquote There is, therefore, a general legal principle ap
plicable between States as well as between individuals to the effect that a person is only responsible for his own acts. The application of this principle \endash  the principle of individual responsibility \endash

 cannot be presumed but must result from an express and unequivocal treaty stipulation or a clear legal provision}{\fs18 . Moreover \'85
 juridically such exceptions are mere obligations derived either from treaty stipulations or from positive law. They are modelled upon responsibility properly so-called, and are supplementary thereto. They in no way affect the nature or the va

\par \tab The essential role that a State\rquote s consent plays in establishing an agency re

 the case of the Belgium-Luxembourg Economic Union; indeed, that was an example that could well be followed as an intermediate solution between independence and federation. Agency could also be occasional, and that was the case contemplated in paragraph 1
 of article 60. Agency of that kind had always existed and had always been regarded as legitimate; the Commission could not overlook it.\rquote  (}{\i\fs18 Yearbook of the International Law Commission}{\fs18 , 1964, vol.1, 732}{\fs18\super nd}{\fs18

\par Professor Ago went on to conclude in the following meeting of the ILC: \lquote 
33. First, with regard to paragraph 1 of article 60, it was quite true that the institution of agency was not so common in international law as it was in private law. Still, it existed in international law and 
its use was more widespread than was generally recognized. It was not the Commission\rquote 
s practice to consider only matters of common occurrence. At its last session it had even adopted an article on fraud, and cases of fraud in international practice were ce
rtainly much rarer than cases of agency. The Commission should therefore deal with the case of one State acting as agent for another, taking care, of course, to draft the article and the commentary in such a way as to avoid giving the impression that it a
pproved of obsolete institutions.\rquote  (}{\i\fs18 Yearbook of the International Law Commission}{\fs18 , 1964, vol.1, 733}{\fs18\super rd }{\fs18 meeting, p.63 at para.33.)}}}{\fs22

an be regarded as a }{\i\fs22 de facto}{\fs22  organ of the State. The extent of the requisite State control varies. Where the question at issue is whether a }{\i\fs22 single}{\fs22  private individual or a }{\i\fs22 group that is not militarily organised
}{\fs22  has acted as a }{\i\fs22 de facto}{\fs22 
 State organ when performing a specific act, it is necessary to ascertain whether specific instructions concerning the commission of that particular act had been issued by that State to the individual or group in question; alternatively, it must be establ

 may be of an overall character (and must comprise more
 than the mere provision of financial assistance or military equipment or training). This requirement, however, does not go so far as to include the issuing of specific orders by the State, or its direction of each individual operation. \'85
 The control required by international law may be deemed to exist when a State (or, in the context of an armed conflict, the Party to the conflict) }{\i\fs22 has a role in organising, coordinating or planning the military actions}{\fs22

 Brownlie goes on to state: \lquote In practice the United Nations has accepted responsibility for the acts of its agents. However, in the case of more specialized organizations with a small number of members, it may be necessary to 
fall back on the collective responsibility of the member states. There is a strong presumption against a delegation of responsibility by a state to an organization arising simply from membership therein. Evidence must be sought of the intention of the sta

In this connection two short points are made in respect of I.T.A.6. First, one is concerned with the relationship of each member vis-\'e0-vis the ITC. \'93The members\'94
 are not simply one person. I.T.A.6 is not an agreement which is simply brought into existence to provide a mechanism whereby the members can harmonise their individual activities. It is to bring into being an organisation which can act against the intere
sts of individual members or groups of members from time to time. The members, by joining it, give up their freedom of action and agree to be bound by the ITC\rquote 
s decisions. For these purposes the ITC is composed of the council and there has to be a certain majority [to make decisions]. \'85
 As a result of vote [sic] decisions become decisions of the body which can be enforced on individual members, including those who voted against it. Secondly, the ITC has a number of executives. The chairman has to be of compl
ete independence, as do all the rest of the officers of the organisation. The officers are only answerable to the council. They cannot reveal information to any of the members \'85
 . Articles 27, 28 and 29 read together impose duties and grant powers to the b
uffer stock manager. That executive is under an obligation by virtue of the constitution [I.T.A.6] to exercise those powers as his rights unless and until the decision making organ of the ITC decides otherwise. \'85 Those are not indications of an agency.

 As Amerasinghe has stated \lquote 
The issue of factual agency could arise in any situation. It does not hinge specifically on the nature of the personality of the organization nor does it flow from the constitutional relationship between the organization and its members, si
nce it rests entirely in the factual position which prevails between the organization and its members and on whether such position according to the law of agency warrants the inference that the organization was not acting on its own behalf but on behalf o
f
 an undisclosed principal, namely the members. Factual agency is, therefore, not intrinsic to the law of international personality which flows from the agreement creating the organization. [Nonetheless,] [i]t is entirely possible that in a given factual s
ituation the agency relationship between the organization and its members could be established.\rquote  (Amerasinghe, C.F., 66-I }{\i\fs18 AIDI}{\fs18 
, (1995), p.353.) For possible examples of factual agency between an organization and its Member States, see Chinkin in the context of the International Tin Council (Chinkin, }{\i\fs18 supra}{\fs18 
 n.14, p.115); and Shihata who contends that in certain limited instances the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development acts as an agent for its Member States (Shihata, I., 66-I }{\i\fs18 AIDI}{\fs18 , (1995), p.312.)}}}{\fs24 
\par  \tab The establishment of a case of }{\i\fs24 de facto}{\fs24  agency will require evidence in a particular case that Member States have consented \endash  either expressly or impliedly \endash 
 to the organization acting on their behalf on an individual or collective basis as well as evidence that the Member States in question have exercised }{\i\fs24 de facto}{\fs24 
 control over the organization. There is an important distinction that needs to be made at this point in our analysis between the case where Member States have expressly consented to an or
ganization acting on their behalf from the case where consent has arguably been implied. This distinction is of practical importance, since where Members have consented in express terms then the degree of control necessary to provide evidence of an agency
 
relationship will be different from the case where consent has arguably been implied. This distinction and its important consequence can be illuminated by considering the two different consent scenarios in the case, for example, of the possible establishm
ent of an agency relationship between the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) and its Member States.

 the requirement for consent would arguably be fulfilled. The express consent operates here to rebut the general presumption that an international organization with separat
e legal personality does not act on behalf of its Member States on an individual or collective basis. The remaining question in such a case is what degree of control would need to be proved to evidence the establishment of an agency relationship? In the c
ase of NATO Member States the cogent argument may be made that evidence of \lquote overall control\rquote  by the States concerned is sufficient to establish a }{\i\fs24 de facto}{\fs24 
 agency relationship. The reasoning for this approach is provided by the ICTY Appeals Chamber in the }{\i\fs24 Tadic}{\fs24 
 case, but it is strictly limited, it should be emphasised, to international organizations of a military nature such as NATO and, once again, to the case where Member States have expressly consented to an organization acting on their behalf on an indivi
dual or collective basis.
\par \tab We recall that the reason why the ICTY Appeals Chamber adopted and used an \lquote overall control\rquote  test as opposed to the \lquote effective control\rquote 
 test was the degree of military organization of the individuals concerned. The greater the de
gree of military organization, the argument runs, the lower the degree of actual control that a State will have to exercise in order for the individuals concerned to be said to be acting on behalf of the State. The reason for this is an implicit \endash 
 unstated \endash 
 presumption the Appeals Chamber is applying that says when a military force is organized then the members of the force will only act pursuant to, and when there are, orders that emanate from its chain-of-command. Where, accordingly, it has been establis
hed in a particular case that a military force is under the overall control of a State the operation of the presumption is such that when the force acts it can be said to be acting on instructions from the State. It is this mechanism of control \endash 
 the chain-of-command \endash 
 that allows dispensing with the requirement to prove the existence of specific instructions from a State concerning the commission of a particular act. In the case of NATO there is a clear chain-of-command that flows from the NATO Council to 
NATO commanders, and this allows the Council to exercise command and control over NATO forces.}{\cs16\fs24\super \chftn {\footnote \pard\plain \s15\qj \fi720\li0\ri230\widctlpar\aspalpha\aspnum\faauto\adjustright\rin230\lin0\itap0

 of agency and not simply a case where the Italian contingent is operating as part of the Italian armed forces }{\i\fs18 per se}{\fs18

 that derives from the legal link established between a Member State and an organization, and as 
such the position of Member State and non-Member State would seem identical. However, the conferral of power on an organization by a non-Member State by contractual treaty may in practice provide much clearer evidence of a State\rquote

anization being able to act on its behalf than in the case of a Member State where such a separate treaty will likely not exist. As such, the presumption against agency may in practice be stronger in the case of the relationship between Member States and 
an organization than in the case where non-Member States have conferred powers on an organization. Moreover, in the case of a military organization \endash  such as NATO \endash 
 the existence of consent to an agency relationship contained in a contractual treaty would h

 This rationale is arguably applicable with a greater degree of cogency to the case of agency under international law. The importance that international law places on States being able to express freely the
ir consent to the acceptance of obligations means that where these obligations are being entered into on their behalf by an agent, then a State should have the right to terminate this agency relationship at will in order to be able to ensure that the assu
mption of its obligations represents at all times the true expression of its will.
\par \tab This right of termination of an agency relationship exists independent of the underlying treaty or other agreement that may have provided for the establishment of the agency
 relationship. Put differently, the principal has the power to decide at any time whether an agent should be able to continue to act on his or her behalf regardless of the existence of any contractual agreement that may exist between the principal and age

to renounce the authority, although doing so is a violation of an agreement between the parties expressly denying the right to revoke or to renounce. The only effect of a provision in a treaty that the authority cannot be terminated by either party is to

\par \tab  Sereni draws an interesting conclusion from the fiduciary nature of the agency relationship in the context of international law when he states:
\par }\pard \qj \li0\ri153\widctlpar\aspalpha\aspnum\faauto\adjustright\rin153\lin0\itap0 {\fs22 
\par No principle or rule of international law forbids that the agent be granted the power of appointing a sub-agent for the purpose of the agency. However, the authority of the agent does not necessarily include th
e power of sub-delegation. This power exists only if it has been granted by the principal. \'85
 In international law even more than in any system of national law, the relationship of principal and agent is a fiduciary one. Since every international transactio
n includes some element of discretion, the principal ordinarily relies upon the personal qualities of the agent. It is, then, to be presumed that the subject appointed to perform some functions cannot sub-delegate another subject to fulfill them on behalf
 of the principal, unless expressly authorized. This presumption applies even when international agency is established in the interest of the principal.}{\cs16\fs22\super \chftn {\footnote \pard\plain

 does arguably possess a limited general competence to sub-delegate conferred powers without an express authorization to do so being necessary.}{\cs16\fs24\super \chftn {\footnote \pard\plain

\par \tab To conclude more generally on our discussion of agency, there are three preconditions for the establishment of an agency relationship in international law: First, that the principal and agent are separate legal enti
ties. Second, that both the principal and agent consent to the relationship. And finally that a principal exercises control over the acts of its agent. The greater the degree of their application in a case the more cogent an argument that what is being co
n
sidered is a relationship of agency. There is, however, a presumption against the establishment of an agency relationship between an international organization and States that have conferred powers on the organization. It is only a presumption against age
n
cy and not a rule since there are cases where an international organization may possibly act as an agent for a State or group of States that have conferred powers on an organization. Where such cases of agency can be established then it has the following 
consequences for the State (principal) \endash 
 organization (agent) relationship: the State concerned will be able to terminate unilaterally the agency relationship; the organization can change the legal relations of the State in question but it does not change i
ts own legal relations when exercising conferred powers; the acts of the organization in the exercise of conferred powers can be attributed to the conferring State for the purposes of State responsibility, and there is a presumption that an organization p
o
ssesses a secondary responsibility for unlawful acts committed in the exercise of conferred powers; and, finally, the organization is under a fiduciary duty to act primarily in the interest of the State concerned in the exercise of the conferred power, ev
en though this may raise an issue of }{\i\fs24 vires}{\fs24  for the organization under its constituent treaty.
